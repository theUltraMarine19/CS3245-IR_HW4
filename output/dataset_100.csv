     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Harrison J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: I agree with Harrison J. 
     
      
    3 HARRISON J: The applicant was arraigned at the District Court of New South Wales at Newcastle on a single count of being an accessory after the fact to an aggravated break, enter and steal offence committed on 15 January 2006. The applicant pleaded guilty on 24 October 2006. He came before his Honour Taylor DCJ on 26 October 2006 and was sentenced to a non-parole period of imprisonment of 18 months to date from 26 August 2006 and to expire on 25 February 2008 with a balance of term of 6 months to commence at the expiration of the non-parole period and to expire on 25 August 2008. 
     
      
    4 The principal offence was an offence against s 112 (2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (""the Act"") and carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty was a combination of the contravention of ss 347, 350 and 112(2) of the Act. 
     
      
    Background 
     
      
    5 The brief facts before his Honour were agreed as follows. 
     
      
    6 The principal offence was committed at premises located in Teralba. The premises are a single storey brick dwelling house. The property has a large garage at the rear that houses the workroom. The workroom is separated from the main garage by a roller door. Two digital security video surveillance cameras monitor the property. Both the house and rear garage are also protected by a security alarm system. The garage has a sensor light that operates by a beam running along its front entrance.  
     
      
    7 A father and son occupied the property. Neither was home on the date the offence was committed. Prior to leaving home the alarm system had been activated. The sliding door at the rear of the house was closed but not locked. 
     
      
    8 At about 9.50am on Sunday 15 January 2006 Paul Tegelaar and Mitchell Coggan drove a motor vehicle to the premises and removed property from inside the house and loaded it onto the vehicle. About 10.45am on the same day the vehicle returned to the premises. Mr Tegelaar entered the garage whilst the vehicle was being repositioned. He came back from the garage pulling a trolley. 
     
      
    9 Three young boys from the next-door property arrived at the premises on their bikes to go for a swim in the pool. They witnessed the return of the vehicle. The applicant approached the boys and had a brief conversation with them. Video images captured by the security camera depict the applicant sitting in the passenger seat of the vehicle. Mr Coggan was driving. Mr Coggan and Mr Tegelaar then entered the house and came back shortly afterwards with a large safe loaded onto the trolley. The applicant assisted Mr Coggan and Mr Tegelaar to load the safe and the trolley into the back of the vehicle. All three men then got into the vehicle and drove away. The applicant was in the back of the vehicle holding the safe in place. 
     
      
    10 On 17 March 2006 the applicant was arrested by police in relation to this matter. He was taken to the Waratah Police Station and given the opportunity to participate in an interview. He declined to do so. 
     
      
    Grounds of appeal 
     
      
    11 The applicant sought leave to appeal to this Court on two grounds. They are as follows: - 
     
      
      11.1 The learned sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant on the basis that he was guilty of an offence for which he was not standing for sentence. 
       
       
      11.2 The learned sentencing judge erred in taking into account as a feature of aggravation that the crime was a planned and organised criminal activity. 
       
      
    12 The issues raised by these separate grounds of appeal are related and it is convenient to deal with them together. 
     
      
    13 Additionally, to a large extent, each of these grounds of appeal relies significantly upon various portions of his Honour's remarks on sentence. These should be examined first. 
     
      
    Remarks on sentence 
     
      
    14 His Honour relevantly commenced his remarks as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""The accessorial offence is a combination of the contravention of sections 347, 350, section 112, subsection (2) of the  
        Crimes Act.  
        It carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. The principal offence carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment, being an accessory itself does not necessarily involve association with a principal offence that it was itself committed in company.  
        Of course, committing an offence in company is an aggravating circumstance, but it is impermissible to have regard to such a circumstance where the offence, being in company, is an integral part of the particular charge 
         in accordance with the  
        De Simoni 
         principle."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    15 A little later in his remarks his Honour said this: - 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        The circumstance that [the applicant] was an accessory to a principal offence that was committed in company in my view, in this case does not sound in a longer or shorter sentence 
        . It is arguable that it contravenes the De Simoni principle that the Court of Criminal Appeal’s given consideration to that issue recently and cautioned the sentencing judges about taking into account a circumstance that is an integral part of an offence. I say those matters by way of an introductory remark."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    16 His Honour then proceeded to recite the short facts. No complaint is made about the way in which his Honour did so. However, the applicant does rely upon some portions of the following passages taken from his Honour's remarks on sentence in support of the present appeal:  
     
      
       
        
        ""The safe that was stolen from the house with the [applicant’s] assistance was subsequently located by police in bushland at West Wallsend the following morning, with some items removed by the co-offenders on the first occasion . . . 
         
         
        The offence is a serious one. The CCTV footage has been recorded on CD Rom which was played on a laptop in court and what is obvious from the movements of the individuals and what one might describe as the teamwork as this was the work of professional thieves. I have read the [applicant's] letter as to his involvement in the offence and I take it into account but I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was a planned and organised criminal activity in accordance with section 21A(2) in I would imagine quite carefully planned and quickly executed with those involved having a clear notion of their role.  
        Nevertheless I bear in mind that the nature of the charge against the offender being an accessory and it was his activity over a relative short period of time that is the basis of objective circumstances for which he is to be sentenced. 
        "" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    17 Finally, the following passage should be noted: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""This is not a case involving violence or threaten with use of weapons or any other matters that section 20A is concerned with, with aggravating offences and I have made a comment about the offence being conducted in company.  
        I do not think it is appropriate to have regard to that as an aggravating circumstance. 
         The criminal history of the offender is such that he really has lost the leniency that he otherwise might have. He is entitled to a discount on sentence that discount on the utilitarian approach of twenty-five per cent. (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    The applicant’s submissions 
     
      
    18 The applicant relied upon the following well-known remarks of Kirby J in R v Olbrich  (1999) 199 CLR 270 at par [53]: 
     
      
       
        
        It is fundamental that the respondent only be sentenced in respect of the particular offence to which he had pleaded guilty and of which he had been convicted. Where there are multiple offences of possible relevance to the facts but the accused has been charged and convicted of one or some only, it is a fundamental error to punish the accused on a basis dependent upon particular circumstances of aggravation which would constitute a different offence of which the accused has not been charged or convicted. 
        
       
      
    19 The applicant emphasised that an accessory after the fact is one who ""receives, comforts, maintains or assists the principal who has committed a felony"": R v White (1977) 16 SASR 571. The crime of the principal must be complete when the accessory after the fact carries out his relevant act or acts. The applicant submitted that in the present case it was axiomatic that helping the principal offenders to steal the safe could not properly form part of the crime for which the applicant stood for sentence, as it was a constituent of the offence committed by the principals. 
     
      
    20 The applicant submitted with particular emphasis upon the second ground of appeal that his Honour failed to differentiate between the offence for which the applicant was to be sentenced and that committed by the principals. It was submitted that it was wholly beside the point that the breaking, entering and stealing offence committed by the principals was planned and organised.  
     
      
    21 In the applicant's submission, the only conduct of the applicant, which could have made him an accessory after the fact, was his act of holding the safe after the vehicle drove away from the scene. This activity, so it was argued, had the tendency to make it less likely that the principal offenders would come to the notice of the authorities. That feature is a necessary constituent of the crime for which the applicant was sentenced. 
     
      
    22 According to this submission, that particular conduct could not properly be described as being part of a plan or an organised criminal activity. The applicant submitted that his Honour conflated the two different offences, a fact that is evident from his Honour's description of the applicant's crime as one involving ""teamwork"". 
     
      
    23 The applicant submitted that, viewed properly, the applicant's crime warranted a lesser penalty than that imposed by the sentencing judge. It was submitted that it was only during the second visit by the principals to the premises that the applicant was present. By inference, according to this submission, the applicant was only recruited when the principal offenders were part way through their crime and required assistance to conceal the safe in the motor vehicle so as to render it less likely that their crime would be detected. 
     
      
    The Crown’s submissions 
     
      
    24 These submissions drew attention to the following matters: - 
     
      
      24.1 His Honour correctly stated that the maximum penalty was 5 years imprisonment. 
       
       
      24.2 His Honour made the distinction between the respective maximum penalties for the principal offence and the accessorial offence at the outset. 
       
       
      24.3 The facts found by his Honour on sentence were consistent with the facts agreed to by the applicant. 
       
       
      24.4 His Honour acknowledged that he should bear in mind that the charge against the applicant was one of accessory. 
      
     
     
      
      24.5 The sentence imposed by his Honour upon the applicant was consistent with his Honour having had regard to the maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment to which he referred. 
       
      
    25 The Crown submitted that his Honour ultimately imposed a sentence that was well within the permissible sentencing range for the offence with which he was charged and to which he pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    26 Finally, the Crown submitted that, with respect to the second ground of appeal, his Honour's remarks on the issue of planning had to be read in context. If they are read in this way, so it is submitted, the applicant has no basis for complaint. 
     
      
    Consideration 
     
      
    27 In my opinion, there is no basis for this Court to intervene or to impose a lesser sentence. It is apparent from his Honour's remarks on sentence when read as a whole, particularly having regard to the emphasised portions appearing in the passages quoted earlier, that he was under no misapprehension in any discernible or relevant respect about the task upon which he was engaged.  
     
      
    28 The burden of the applicant's submissions is that it is patent from the terms of his Honour’s remarks on sentence that he fell into error by sentencing the applicant as if he were a principal or by having regard to features of aggravation relevant to the principal offence but which were wholly irrelevant to the applicant's crime. In my opinion his Honour did no such thing. It is not without significance that his Honour’s remarks on sentence contain the emphasised portions referred to earlier and that they appear effectively at the start, the middle, and at the end of those remarks. That reiteration of the correct principles underscores and bespeaks his Honour's understanding and appreciation of their importance. It also serves to put in context the references that his Honour made to the circumstances of the principal offence. 
     
      
    29 In fairness to his Honour it would have to be said that his task was not made any easier by the material provided to him at the sentencing hearing. In this regard it is perhaps timely to recall a comments of Howie J in R v Palu (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at pars [20] and [21] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[20] A particular defect in the proceedings, which is now of significance, is that it was never made clear by the parties with any particularity at all the extent of the factual disputes that had to be resolved by his Honour. This was largely because there was a degree of procedural informality that was inappropriate once it was clear that the parties were not ad idem as to the factual basis upon which the respondent was to be sentenced or the appropriate sentencing disposition. Disputes and issues that arose were determined in an ad hoc fashion, if at all. The prosecutor, who finally had carriage of the matter, complained at one stage that she had not had access to the presentence report and was not aware of what had been said earlier in the proceedings when she was not present. Ultimately the order under s 11 was made without his Honour ever ascertaining the extent of the factual matters in dispute between the parties or attempting to resolve them.  
         
         
        [21] It behoves the parties, especially after a ""plea bargain"", to ensure that the sentencing court is made aware from the outset of the proceedings whether there is any dispute as to the factual basis upon which the offender is to be sentenced and identify with particularity what matters are in issue. Disputed facts are to be resolved by accusatorial process upon evidence before the court;  
        Chow v Director of Public Prosecutions  
        (1992) 28 NSWLR 593 at 604-608; 63 A Crim R 316 at 325-328. If a statement of facts is to be tendered, it should both support the charge for which the offender is to be sentenced and accord with the offence charged. It should not contain facts that would aggravate the offence in breach of the principle in  
        R v De Simoni 
         (1981) 147 CLR 383; 5 A Crim R 329. If it purports to be an agreed statement of facts so that it is intended to provide the factual basis upon which the parties wish the court to sentence the offender, the facts should be sufficient to permit the court to exercise its discretion and the Crown should not tender other material which might supplement or contradict the facts set out in the agreed statement. If other material is placed before the court which relates to the facts of the offence, then the parties should understand that the court is not bound by the tendered statement of facts or any agreement made between the parties as to the basis upon which the offender is to be sentenced:  
        R v Altham 
         (1992) 62 A Crim R 126;  
        Chow v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) 
         (at 606; 327). All too frequently, or so it seems to me, uncertainty, confusion and, sometimes, error arises because of the failure of the parties, and in particular the Crown, to clearly identify the material upon which the facts of the matter are to be gleaned by the sentencing court. So it was in the present case.""  
        
       
      
    30 In the present case, by strict adherence to, and proper application of, correct principle, and despite possibly some uncertainty and confusion on the part of those appearing before him, his Honour has avoided falling into error of any kind. His Honour's remarks indicate that he well knew and understood that the applicant was being sentenced as an accessory after the fact of a serious principal offence. Nothing in his Honour's remarks on sentence lead me to conclude that his Honour somehow erroneously conflated the serious – or indeed any - elements of that principal offence with elements of the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced. 
     
      
    31 Moreover, it was on any view open to his Honour to find that the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced was part of a planned and organised criminal activity. It is difficult to accept that the applicant found himself in the motor vehicle in the circumstances described by his Honour without some degree of planning of one sort or another. This is not the same as saying that the applicant’s criminal acts were part of the principal offence or that his Honour sentenced the applicant as if he were a participant in the principal crime and somehow liable to be dealt with accordingly. 
     
      
    32 The applicant makes no other complaint of error by his Honour in the exercise of his sentencing discretion. The applicant was born on 11 September 1970. He had a long criminal history and had served several sentences of imprisonment. He was given a 25 per cent discount for his early plea. There were no submissions made in relation to special circumstances. No sentencing option other than full time custody was advanced or available. Even accepting the applicant's submissions at their highest, no other sentence in my opinion was warranted in law or should have been passed. 
     
      
       
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    33 In my opinion the following orders should be made: - 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal granted. 
       
      2. Appeal dismissed.

     MG v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: An application for leave to appeal was listed before the Court on Tuesday, 28 August 2007 in relation to the sentences imposed on the applicant by Finnane DCJ on 11 October 2002. 
     
      
    2 The Crown concedes that the sentencing must be reconsidered for two reasons. First, the applicant was originally sentenced following convictions in two separate trials. In the first trial, he was convicted of 10 sexual offences committed on 10 August 2000 in relation to two young women aged 17 and 18 years. In the second trial, he was convicted of four offences in relation to conduct on 30 August 2000, involving one girl. In relation to the latter offences, a retrial was ordered by this Court in 2004, as a result of which he was subsequently acquitted of the charges. The second basis for re-sentencing is that a co-accused who the Director states was guilty of a similar level of culpability, was re-sentenced by this Court in 2005. 
     
      
    3 Although it will not be necessary to consider the facts of the matter in any detail at this stage, it should be noted that there is a statutory constraint on publication or broadcasting of names of the parties or of other persons involved in proceedings, pursuant to s 11 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW). That prohibition has application in the present case. 
     
      
    4 When the matter came on for hearing, counsel for the applicant drew the Court’s attention to s 25 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, which, the Director accepts, has application in the present case. The operative part of that section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        25 Background reports 
         
          
          … 
           
          (2) A court shall not sentence a person to whom this section applies to a term of imprisonment … in connection with an offence unless: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) a background report, prepared in accordance with the regulations, has been tendered in evidence with respect to the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence … .” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    5 Once it was accepted that this Court should re-sentence the applicant, that provision was engaged. 
     
      
    6 Pursuant to the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Regulation 2005, “background reports” are required to be in a particular form and to deal with specified matters. Thus, cl 6 of the Regulation provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        6 Background Reports 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          For the purpose of section 25(2)(a) of the Act, a background report must be in such form as the Attorney-General may from time to time approve and must deal with such of the following matters as are relevant to the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence concerned: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person’s family background,  
           
          (b) the person’s employment,  
           
          (c) the person’s education, 
           
          (d) the person’s friends and associates, 
           
          (e) the nature and extent of the person’s participation in the life of the community, 
           
          (f) the person’s disabilities, 
           
          (g) the person’s antecedents, 
           
          (h) such other matters as the Children’s Court may require, 
           
          (i) such other matters as the prosecutor considers appropriate to include in the report.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    7 A background report was prepared for the original sentencing hearing. Although the Court was not taken to the document for the purposes of the present application, the report before the sentencing judge appears to have been one dated 22 August 2002, prepared by a Juvenile Justice Counsellor, Sex Offender Program and the Clinical Coordinator, Sex Offender Program at Baxter Juvenile Justice Centre. 
     
      
    8 The provision in paragraph 6(h) of the Regulation permitting the report to deal with such matters as the Children’s Court may require, would appear to have no operation, the report being prepared for the purposes of the District Court. Whether other matters were considered appropriate for inclusion, beyond those specified in paragraphs (a)-(g), pursuant to paragraph (i) by “the prosecutor” is not known. The indictment dated 29 April 2002 was signed by a Crown prosecutor on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions and it may be assumed that either the Crown prosecutor or the Director would constitute the “prosecutor” for this purpose. 
     
      
    9 For the applicant it was contended that the report has two major failings. First, it dealt with “offences” of which the applicant has been acquitted. Secondly, it contained an assessment of “risk” which purported to assess risks of recidivism for different kinds of offence. Whether that material was properly included in the statutory background report need not be considered for present purposes. It is sufficient to note that the assessment was affected by convictions for offences of which the applicant has now been acquitted. 
     
      
    10 Counsel for the applicant contended either that the report no longer constituted a background report for the purposes of s 25 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, or, if it did so qualify, it was nevertheless unhelpful and the Court should order that a further report be prepared. 
     
      
    11 Counsel for the Director raised a doubt as to both limbs of the applicant’s contention. First, he contended that the report remained a valid background report, for the purposes of s 25 and no further report was required. The second stage of his argument went further, asserting that this Court had no power to order a further background report. He submitted that the report was required to deal with matters relevant to “the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence concerned”, which could not include subsequent events. He sought support for that position in a decision of the Court of Appeal in Roos v Director of Public Prosecutions (1994) 34 NSWLR 254. In that case proceedings were taken to quash a control order made in the District Court, on appeal from the Children’s Court, on a number of grounds, including a failure to comply with s 25 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. The basis for the complaint was that, although a background report had been prepared for the purposes of the Children’s Court hearing, no fresh report was prepared or tendered in the District Court. The claimant’s contention was summarised by Handley JA (with whom, relevantly for present purposes, both Sheller JA and Powell JA agreed) in the following terms (p 260D-E): 
     
      
       
        
        “It was submitted that the section required an up-to-date report. However the ‘background report’ is not a pre-sentence report by another name. It is a report ‘with respect to the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence’ which do not change with the passage of time.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour then referred to cl 6 of the Regulation, noting its content, and continued: 
       
       
        
        “However the statute requires a report ‘with respect to the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence’ and if the Regulation required the report to deal with circumstances which were not in existence or known at the time of the offence it would be beyond power. In these circumstances, s 32 of the  
        Interpretation Act 
         1987 requires the clause to be read down so as not to exceed the regulation-making power. Accordingly the 1993 background report satisfied the requirements of s 25(2) in the District Court and I reject this ground of challenge.” 
        
       
      
    12 A background report will always be prepared after the offence has been committed and indeed after the person has pleaded guilty or been found guilty or convicted of the offence: s 25(1)(a). It will therefore contain information which was unknown, at least to the authors, prior to the preparation of the report. If the young person has undergone medical or other tests following his or her arrest, the report may well contain information which was unknown to anyone at the time of the offence. Further, information may become known after the preparation of the report which suggests, or even demonstrates, that the report was incomplete or inaccurate. 
     
      
    13 For present purposes it is not necessary to determine whether there are circumstances in which a background report is demonstrated later to be so inaccurate, or to contain such extraneous material, that it should not be treated as a valid background report for the purposes of s 25(2). Nor is it necessary to consider the consequences of reliance upon such a report in relation to the sentencing proceedings. 
     
      
    14 In the present case, the existing report deals with offences other than those for which the applicant now stands convicted and accordingly not only deals with matters outside the scope of those required to be dealt with by the Act and Regulation, but deals with them on an entirely inappropriate basis. No doubt a report may properly deal with multiple offences: however, they must be offences to which the young person has pleaded guilty, been found guilty or has been convicted, as required by s 25(1)(a). The applicant seeks a fresh report and it would clearly assist this Court to have a report in proper form, whether s 25(2) has already been complied with or not. 
     
      
    15 It should be sufficient for this Court to indicate its wishes in that regard, but as there appears to be some doubt as to whether a second report can appropriately be prepared, the Court should, as requested, order the preparation of a further background report. Counsel for the Director noted, correctly, that no provision in the Act or Regulation expressly confers power on this Court to order a background report. However, it does not follow that this Court is impotent in the face of a statutory obligation not to sentence a person without such a report; the proper construction of s 25 is that it impliedly confers power on the Court to order such a report where necessary. 
     
      
    16 It was for these reasons that the Court made the order in the present case. In so ordering, the Court did not, and does not, reach any conclusion as to whether the existing report is a background report for the purposes of the sentencing to be undertaken in this Court. Nor does it reach any conclusion as to the admissibility of material contained in the existing report. Similarly, any dispute which may arise in relation to the further report will need to be dealt with by the Court as constituted for the sentencing hearing. 
     
      
    17 Although counsel for the applicant indicated that the arguments in relation to the application and appeal would fall within a small compass and suggested that they could be presented forthwith, allowing the parties an opportunity to make further submissions in writing following the receipt of the further background report, the Court did not accede to that suggestion. Whilst the Court is mindful of the passage of time since the commission of the offences for which the applicant stands convicted, it is not persuaded that the proposed course will necessarily achieve expedition. It is not yet known what will be in the further background report, nor whether it will lead to arguments as to admissibility. The possibility that this bench might need to reconvene for a further hearing militates against proceeding to a stage where the Court would be part-heard. Accordingly, the Court declined to hear further argument on the substance of the application and the appeal. The matter will need to be relisted at a time when the background report will have been obtained and dealt with in accordance with s 25(2)(a) and (b). 
     
      
    18 For these reasons, the Court made the following orders last Tuesday: 
     
      
       
      (1) Order that the Director take steps to have a further background report prepared with respect to the offences for which the applicant stands convicted. 
       
       
      (2) Stand the matter over to Registrar Drennan’s list at 9.00am on 30 August 2007 to fix a date for hearing. 
       
      
    19 LATHAM J: I agree with the reasons expressed by Basten JA. 
     
      
    20 ROTHMAN J: I agree with Basten JA.

      70235/2002 - REGINA v MOTEKIAI TAUFAHEMA 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Motekiai Taufahema, you appear for sentence after pleading guilty upon arraignment to the crime of manslaughter of Glenn McEnallay. 
     
      
    2 These remarks are primarily directed to you in order to provide an exposition of the reasons for the sentence which will be imposed upon you but it is also desirable to express some matters on public record and, to an extent, this will require some references to legal proceedings and their consequences and to some facts, with which you are, no doubt, already quite familiar. 
     
      
    3 Senior Constable McEnallay was shot by Sione Penisini on 27 March 2002 and died as a result of his wounds several days later. You were one of the four occupants of a reportedly stolen motor car which Senior Constable McEnallay approached in the course of his duty as a highway patrol officer. The four of you were respectively charged with murder and various other offences. I note that the proceedings against Penisini, Meli Lagi and your brother John (Sione) Taufahema took place before Wood CJ at CL. 
     
      
    4 Upon arraignment on 21 March 2003 Penisini pleaded guilty to murdering Senior Constable McEnallay as well as a charge of using a firearm whilst not being authorized to do so. On 13 August 2003 he pleaded guilty to a further charge which can shortly be described as attempted car jacking. On 2 October 2003 for those three offences his Honour sentenced Penisini to imprisonment for thirty four years dating from 27 March 2004 with a non-parole period of twenty three years, and fixed terms of five years and six years imprisonment dating from 27 March 2002. An appeal by the Crown asserting the inadequacy of the sentence for murder was dismissed. 
     
      
    5 Lagi was found not guilty at trial of the murder of Senior Constable McEnallay but guilty of using an offensive weapon in company with intent to prevent lawful arrest and he pleaded guilty to a charge of possessing a firearm without authority. For those two offences his Honour sentenced Lagi to imprisonment for ten years with a non-parole period of six years dating from 3 April 2005 and to imprisonment for four years dating from the same date. The commencement date was established by reason of a sentence being served by Lagi for an unrelated offence which had commenced on 21 May 2002. 
     
      
    6 John Taufahema was found guilty, after trial, of the murder of Senior Constable McEnallay. He had pleaded guilty at the commencement of trial to using an offensive weapon in company with intent to prevent lawful apprehension, attempted car jacking (as in the case of Penisini) and using a firearm without authority. Wood CJ at CL sentenced him for these four offences to imprisonment for twenty one years dating from 27 March 2005 with a non-parole period of fourteen years and fixed terms of imprisonment of seven years dating from 27 March 2004 and six years and five years dating from 27 March 2002. By order of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 16 February 2007, the conviction and sentence for murder were quashed and a new trial ordered on that count. Upon further arraignment John Taufahema pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter, and the Crown later notified its acceptance to that plea of guilty in satisfaction of the indictment. John Taufahema is remanded for a sentencing hearing on 30 November next. 
     
      
    7 You stood trial before Sully J and a jury and were convicted on counts in the indictment charging the murder of Senior Constable McEnallay and unlawful possession of a firearm. On 10 September 2004 his Honour sentenced you for these two offences to imprisonment for twenty one years dating from 26 March 2004 with a non-parole period of fourteen years and a fixed term of imprisonment of five years dating from 27 March 2002. You have served the latter sentence in full and it is now expired. 
     
      
    8 On 8 May 2006 the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld your appeal and quashed your conviction and sentence on the count of murder and ordered the entry of a judgment of acquittal on that count. The Crown was granted special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia against that judgment and on 21 March 2007 that Court, by majority, upheld the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal and in lieu of the verdict and judgment of acquittal, ordered that there be a new trial.  
     
      
    9 On 6 July 2007 the Crown presented an indictment charging you with the manslaughter of Senior Constable McEnallay and to that indictment you have pleaded guilty and I have directed the entry of a judgment of conviction of that crime upon the indictment. It is for that offence of manslaughter, and no other, that it is now my duty to pass sentence upon you. It is required for me to find facts not inconsistent with your guilt of the offence of manslaughter for the purpose of sentence. There has been an agreed statement of facts which, in accordance with recognized practice, articulates the relevant Crown allegations and your acceptance of them. I act upon those facts as applicable findings for the purpose of sentence.  
     
      
    10 They are: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. On 27 March 2002 Motekiai Taufahema, his brother John Taufahema, Meli Lagi and Sione Penisini went to Bankstown. They collected a green commodore sedan (hereafter ‘the commodore’). The vehicle was supplied to Penisini. The commodore’s owner had reported it stolen some months earlier. The report was false and was part of an attempted fraud on an insurance company. The occupants of the vehicle were not involved in the fraud however each was on parole in relation to other offences. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The accused drove the commodore from Bankstown to his flat in Little Bay. He was at that time unlicensed. On the way to the flat two off duty police officers noticed the commodore while it was driven in a fast and erratic manner in Botany Road Matraville. The officers followed the commodore to Little Bay but eventually lost sight of it. While looking for it they saw an unmarked police vehicle occupied by Constable McEnallay. They told him about the vehicle. Constable McEnallay made radio inquiries and established that the vehicle had been reported stolen. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The accused drove the commodore from his flat at Mirrabooka Crescent Little Bay to Bunnerong Road. The other three men were in the vehicle, which also contained four fully loaded revolvers, two pairs of gloves, a quantity of ammunition and a hockey mask. The accused and his passengers had joint possession of the revolvers. It was established that they had been stolen from a security business in Matraville on 14 March 2002. There is no evidence that the accused was involved in the theft. 
        
       
       
        
        4. At about 5.48 pm Senior Constable McEnallay started following the commodore. When he reached the intersection of Dennison Road and Beauchamp Road, Hillsdale he activated his vehicle’s siren and lights. The accused then accelerated and made a sharp right hand turn into Grace Campbell Crescent. At around 5.51pm the commodore was effectively immobilized. One of its wheels was damaged as the result of impact with the gutter or a traffic island. Constable McEnallay stopped the police vehicle a short distance from the commodore. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Penisini got out of the vehicle, pointed his revolver at the police officer and fired five shots. Four of the bullets struck Constable McEnallay in the chest and head. A week later he died from his wounds. Penisini, the accused and other occupants ran from the vehicle. At that time each was armed with a loaded revolver. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The accused separated from the others and ran down Grace Campbell Crescent. He entered the yard of a residence in Rhodes Street Hillsdale and hid the revolver in a garden. He was arrested a short time later and the revolver was found where he had hidden it. 
        
       
       
        
        8. John Taufahema and Penisini were arrested not far from the scene of the shooting. Lagi escaped but was arrested a few days later.” 
        
       
      
    11 No doubt having due regard to the history of litigation regarding the charges against you, there has also been included in the document, which has been signed by you, a statement of the basis of your liability for the crime of manslaughter. It is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The accused admits that he was complicit in the act that caused Constable McEnallay’s death. His complicity arises from his participation in a joint criminal enterprise to possess the revolvers. They fall within the definition of ‘firearm’ in the version of the Firearms Act 1996 applicable to this matter. Section 7(1) of that Act creates an offence if a person possesses a firearm without having a licence or permit to do so (foundational offence). The possession was an ongoing offence and included travelling in the vehicle with the loaded revolvers. Neither the accused nor the other occupants were authorised to have possession of the revolvers. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused contemplated the possibility that one of the occupants might discharge a revolver (incidental offence) but without the intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. In the absence of a lawful purpose, the firing of a firearm in or near a public place is a breach of section 93G(1)(b) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . That conduct would also constitute an unlawful and dangerous act. Penisini’s firing of the weapon caused Constable McEnallay’s death. Notwithstanding the accused’s contemplation that one of them might discharge one of the firearms he maintained his participation in the commission of the foundational crime.” 
        
       
      
    12 Now is not the occasion for a dissertation upon the law of liability for complicity in a joint criminal enterprise, but two things should be made explicit. It is not, and never has been, suggested that any physical act by you constituted the actual homicide and, second, the level of your culpability in terms of your mental state is to be gauged against the assertion, which you admit, that you contemplated the possibility that one of the other occupants of the car might discharge a firearm but not that he might do so while at the time intending to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    13 So to say is not to minimize your culpability for the crime, nor to ignore that death in fact resulted but it is to define the context in which that culpability should be judged. 
     
      
    14 There are other factors which I take into account which are germane to assessment of the level of seriousness of your offence and what needs to be particularly reflected in your sentence. 
     
      
    15 Of crucial importance is the circumstance that the victim was a police officer acting in the pursuit of his duties. It has been said that a need to include a substantial element of general deterrence in a sentence for such an offence is compellingly obvious. The community is dependent upon efficient, and, as was Senior Constable McEnallay, courageous police officers for its protection and it is my duty to make clear that the Courts support them by condign punishment of those who participate in offering violence to them.  
     
      
    16 It is submitted by the Crown that your offence is further aggravated by the actual use of one of the four loaded pistols which were in the possession of the occupants of the stolen car. That is undoubtedly a serious circumstance but it is necessary to ensure that there is no double counting of the elements of your culpability. It is an essential ingredient of the liability which you bear for the crime that one of those pistols was in fact used and that you foresaw that it might be used. Obviously the sentence should contain an element of deterrence against others who might be tempted to engage in unlawful activity concerning firearms particularly concealable weapons such as pistols, but that is not to find that there should be some further enhancement of the assessment of sentence which is otherwise appropriate. 
     
      
    17 You were on parole at the time of committing this offence. It scarcely needs to be said that such a circumstance is a matter of aggravation in that at the very least it displays a lack of appreciation of the conditional liberty which had previously been granted to you and it is in itself a contraindication against reposing future trust in you.  
     
      
    18 As is self evident from what I have just said, you have a record of convictions otherwise. Your date of birth is 7 June 1976. Your offending started at about the age of sixteen and involved multiple appearances in the Children’s Court. You were just eighteen when first imprisoned by the District Court for offences of stealing motor vehicles, assault and robbery. In December 1999 you were again sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. It was during the currency of parole for these offences that the present crime was committed. In the span of time between the sentences imposed in the District Court you were also sentenced at Burwood Local Court for offences including being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence.  
     
      
    19 That history of convictions operates to deprive you of some of the leniency to which you might otherwise have a claim if the current offence was an isolated act of criminality. Clearly it was not. 
     
      
    20 On 27 May 2005 you were sentenced at Campbelltown District Court for offences committed prior to 14 November 2001. At the time of that imposition you were, of course in custody serving the sentences imposed by Sully J. The fixed term of five years commencing on 27 March 2002 for possession of a firearm was not the subject of an appeal either by you or by the Crown and the sentence which his Honour imposed for murder was not quashed until 8 May 2006. I shall return to refer to the May 2005 sentences. 
     
      
    21 I turn now to some matters which have been raised on your behalf.  
     
      
    22 You are thirty one years of age. You have been in a de facto relationship with Ms Langbien since 1996 and are the father of a daughter who was born after your arrest in this matter. I note the content of Ms Langbien’s affidavit sworn 15 August 2007 which was not the subject of challenge, and her statement that she looks forward to your release when you are able to live together as a family. I also acknowledge the affidavit evidence of your father Maunaloa Taufahema recording that he visits you and that you will have the support of your family when you are released. I note that his statement is corroborated in the Corrective Services records which have been exhibited to the affidavit of Miss Hunter sworn 14 August 2007 which includes “good family support from ….receives regular visits”. The names of the visitors have obviously been deleted from the document which was produced pursuant to Freedom of Information request.  
     
      
    23 From the same sources I observe notations that you are recorded as being compliant with unit routine and that you cause no problem to staff. This material shows a potential for rehabilitation which I accept has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    24 The documentation to which I have referred was made, it seems, to a large extent prior to the murder conviction being quashed in May 2006. The letter from the Serious Offenders Review Council which is exhibited to Miss Hunter’s affidavit of 16 August 2007 does not inform the basis upon which the Commissioner has designated you as EHR (Extreme High Risk). In particular it does not specify that the reason for classification is that you have been assessed as being an extreme danger to other people or that you are an extreme threat to good order and security. The records to which I have referred would tend to show the contrary. 
     
      
    25 It appears that the only one of the twenty indicators used by the High Security Management Committee which would have applied to you prior to May 2006 was indicator number 9, namely that you had been convicted of the murder of a law enforcement official. Conviction for murder was, as I have said, quashed and you are now convicted of manslaughter and not of murder.  
     
      
    26 This is of some significance, as your EHR status has effects which make your custody more onerous than it would be if you were kept in the general prison population without that classification. No challenge was offered to your affidavit evidence that you are, in that circumstance, locked in your cell each day from 2.30 pm until 8.30 am the following day and are subjected to particular restraint when in transit. You are inhibited from education and a variety of otherwise available work. I observe that the Department’s records also state that you cope well with regular moves which are apparently imposed upon EHR inmates and that you do so without incident. 
     
      
    27 The problem that I perceive is that it is received sentencing doctrine that a judge may take into account in mitigation probable conditions of incarceration which are likely to be more onerous than would generally be the case, but the attempt by your solicitors to extract relevant information from the Serious Offenders Review Council produced a response which seems focussed upon delineating the criteria but does not inform whether any identified criterion, particularly after you ceased to be convicted of the murder of a law enforcement officer, has been applied to you.  
     
      
    28 All the information made available to me does not suggest that you now fulfil any of the criteria of the twenty indicators supplied, so as to provoke your being designated EHR. I recognize that a matter of mitigation needs only to be proved on the balance of probabilities but as I expect that in due course, and I would hope promptly, your status should be reviewed and I consider it improbable that EHR classification will remain once it is appreciated that you do not fulfil the criterion of indicator 9, I anticipate that the situation will change. 
     
      
    29 Up until 2006 it was, upon the published criteria, appropriate that you be so classified and I take into account that although since then you probably should not have been subjected to the conditions applicable to EHR status you were so classified, and, as well, I take into account the possibility that, despite your not meeting the criterion in indicator 9, the Commissioner, for some reason, which is not apparent to me, may continue the designation in the future. 
     
      
    30 I have a report from Dr Christopher Lennings who saw and assessed you as recently as the first of this month. I do not need to summarize what can be read there. I accept generally the doctor’s observations. I have been particularly impressed by the recording of your statements to him revealing your thoughts about the devastating effects of the killing on Senior Constable McEnallay’s family. I have frequently enough encountered offenders who describe at length the effect of their crime on themselves to say that it is sufficiently unusual to observe a lengthy description of thought which shows an appreciation of the effect of a crime upon others, to persuade me that, in distinction from those others, you have a genuine remorse for your participation in the senseless actions which culminated in the Constable’s death. 
     
      
    31 Your plea of guilty is a factor contributing to a finding that you are contrite. The order of the High Court was made on 21 March 2007. You offered to plead guilty to manslaughter in the following month and the Crown acceptance was formalised by the indictment presented on 5 July. A plea of guilty gives rise to consideration of mitigation of penalty, both pursuant to statute and the common law. A significant factor in the assessment of any element of mitigation for the practical benefits of the administration of justice is the promptness of the plea. It was not suggested that the Crown would have accepted a plea of guilty to manslaughter prior to the High Court decision and I would classify your plea, in the unusual circumstances of this case wherein you stood acquitted between the determination of the High Court and the orders made by the Court of Criminal Appeal, as having been made at the earliest opportunity. 
     
      
    32 You were the respondent to the successful Crown appeal, in your case an appeal against acquittal, and that should be taken into account because you have been exposed to what is usually called, if slightly inaccurately, a double jeopardy.  
     
      
    33 As the matter was raised by senior counsel on your behalf I should record that I do not find any useful assistance in referring to the sentences imposed upon Penisini and Lagi who were convicted of different offences. 
     
      
    34 The applicable sentencing legislation provides a proportion to be applied between non-parole period and balance term which can be departed from when special circumstances are found. The designation of a prisoner as EHR is such a circumstance, although for reasons earlier discussed, I would see this as only a possibility in the future. Nevertheless, as Dr Lennings wrote, significant rehabilitation effort will be required and, adding to the possibility that EHR status will not be revoked, for those reasons I find departure from the statutory formula should occur. I have been supplied with sentencing statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission. Manslaughter is the offence which has the widest span of culpability for a crime within its compass. It can range from death resulting from negligence to intentional killing reduced to manslaughter by reason of provocation or mental state. The statistics do not reveal whether any case therein involved the considerable aggravating factor that the victim was a policeman pursuing his duty at the time.  
     
      
    35 It is self evident that your culpability for manslaughter should be reflected in a lesser sentence than that imposed upon you for the more serious crime of murder. 
     
      
    36 Before turning to deal with the structuring and imposition of sentence I should acknowledge the reading of a victim impact statement by Senior Constable McEnallay’s father on his own behalf and on behalf of other family members. Their suffering and continuing feelings of loss do not increase any sentence which it is otherwise appropriate to impose upon you but it is a reminder to the Court, to you and to the public generally, of their grief and the senselessness of a brave police officer’s untimely death. 
     
      
    37 I have already stated the agreed basis of your liability for manslaughter and I have referred to the joint criminal enterprise upon which you concede that you were embarked. It is not to put aside the responsibility deriving from participation in the joint enterprise nor to ignore the fatal outcome to recount in summary what your particular actions were. You were the driver of the reportedly stolen car and Lagi was in the front seat with you. Penisini, who fired the fatal shots, had disembarked from the back seat. You were the last to exit the car. You ran from the scene in a different direction from the other previous occupants of the car. You attempted to hide the pistol with which you were armed but were arrested shortly afterwards. There is no allegation that you brandished your pistol, and testing found no residue on it after it had been seized, hence it was demonstrated that it had not been fired. 
     
      
    38 The only sentence which I impose upon you is for the crime of manslaughter but it is necessary to take into account service of some associated and unassociated sentences. There is a principle of totality to be borne in mind.  
     
      
    39 As already stated, you have served a sentence of five years imprisonment between the date of your arrest on 27 March 2002 and 26 March 2007 for possessing an unlawful firearm. When you were sentenced by Sully J for murder the effect of his orders as to concurrency was that you would serve two years exclusively for the firearms offence and would serve the balance of three years for that offence whilst serving the sentence for your then conviction of murder. In addition between 28 March 2002 and 25 May 2002 you served the balance of parole for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in respect of which you were at conditional liberty at the time of the offence which resulted in the loss of Senior Constable McEnallay’s life.  
     
      
    40 However, as I indicated above, subsequently, on 27 May 2005 you were sentenced at Campbelltown District Court on counts of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty and affray. These offences were charged on 14 November 2001 and clearly preceded the offence of manslaughter for which you now stand for sentence. However, the effective sentence for those offences was a head sentence of three years and four months imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and six months each dating from 27 May 2005. Thus that sentence was served concurrently with the sentence of unlawful possession of a firearm between 27 May 2005 up until 26 March 2007 as well as, until 8 May 2006, the now quashed sentence for murder. 
     
      
    41 Taking into account those sentences, except of course the imposition by Sully J for the offence of murder, which is no longer charged against you, I have determined a starting date for the offence of manslaughter of 27 March 2005.  
     
      
    42 Save a discount from sentence for what is conventionally referred to as the utilitarian value of your prompt plea of guilty once it was available to you to plead to the offence of manslaughter, I would, taking into account matters of aggravation and mitigation, have assessed a sentence for your offence of manslaughter of thirteen years and six months. Giving credit for the utilitarian value of the plea I would reduce that assessment to eleven years imprisonment. Application of the statutory formula would produce a non-parole period of eight years and three months with a balance term of two years and nine months. By reason of my finding of special circumstances I have assessed a non-parole period of seven years. 
     
      
    43 I have earlier mentioned the principle of totality. It is always appropriate to consider the overall effect of multiple impositions. In a global sense therefore I note that for the possession of the unlawful firearm, the service of the balance of parole before mentioned, the offences dealt with at Campbelltown in 2005 and the sentence for manslaughter which I am about to impose, you will be in custody for a minimum of ten years after your arrest on 27 March 2002, after which it is possible that you may be again released to parole. Whether you are so released is a decision for the relevant Parole Board Authority. 
     
      
    44 Motekiai Taufahema, for the manslaughter of Glenn McEnallay, you are sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of seven years dating from 27 March 2005 and expiring on 26 March 2012 with a balance term of four years dating from 27 March 2012. 
     
      
    45 The earliest date of eligibility for your release to parole is specified as 26 March 2012.

   Introduction1. The first plaintiff (hereafter referred to as “the plaintiff”) is the registered proprietor of “Bonny Glen” at Woodward Road, Orange, New South Wales. The Hall family has operated a successful apple orchard on these premises since 1973. The second plaintiff (hereafter referred to as “Parkwood”) is the property adjoining Bonny Glen. Proceedings between the second plaintiff and the defendant have settled but Mr Hawke, who lives on the Parkwood property, gave evidence in these proceedings. 2. The defendant (“Country Energy”) supplies electricity and is the owner of power lines running parallel to, and more or less on top of, pine trees on the Parkwood property. It has been conceded that Country Energy has the power of entry onto private property over which their power lines run in order to maintain those power lines. 3. The plaintiff brings proceedings for damages for negligence and breach of contract arising from the circumstances in which a row of 61 pine trees on Parkwood, which operated as a windbreak for both properties, burned down as a result of a fire caused by contact between the trees and the wires. It had been the practice of Country Energy to attend the premises every few years for the purpose of trimming back these trees if necessary; their last visit before the fire on 10 November 2002 had been approximately 18 months beforehand.4. Part of the claim for damages is relatively straightforward. The fire on 10 November 2002 not only destroyed 49 of the 61 pine trees on Parkwood, but also destroyed and damaged Gala and Granny Smith apple trees on Bonny Glen. Approximately 28 Gala trees in the field adjacent to the pine trees were destroyed. A further 67 Gala trees suffered fire damage in that their fruit, leaves and shoots were damaged. In addition, 8 Granny Smith trees were destroyed and a further 24 Granny Smith trees suffered fire damage. The fire also destroyed fencing and irrigation systems on Bonny Glen. The principal issue in relation to this claim for damages (which the parties referred to in submissions as “Category 1 damages’, in the event of the plaintiff succeeding on liability, is the issue of quantum and whether past and future economic loss are claimable.5. The plaintiff’s additional claim for damages (which the parties in submissions called “Category 2 damages” arises from the plaintiff’s decision to cut down the rest of the apple trees in this orchard because of spraydrift problems after the pine tree windbreak was destroyed by the fire. There is unchallenged evidence that this orchard, immediately adjacent to the 61 pine trees, was what could be called the star performer in the plaintiff’s orchard. This was in part because the presence of the pine tree buffer was beneficial to the growing of fruit trees in this orchard, because they prevented spray drift. If apple trees cannot be sprayed, the many pests that are attracted to apple trees will quickly devour the fruit and destroy the commercial viability of the apple trees. However, this highly poisonous spray drift may harm not only flora and fauna but also people in the surrounding areas and expose the person spraying the poisons to penalties. The plaintiffs received a report to this effect from two experts, Mr Collette and Mr Kidd, and by reason of these experts’ advice about the risk of spray drift going onto the Parkwood property, they removed the remaining 190 Gala trees and 72 Granny Smith trees (see the evidence of Mr Fred Hall at T-16-22, Mr Bernard Hall at T-119-123 and Mr Timothy Hall at T-263-268).6. The first issue in these proceedings is the question of liability. The fire7. On Sunday, 10 November 2002, while David Hawke was in his home at Parkwood, Woodward Road, Orange, his stepson, who had been playing cricket on the property, came running in to him and told him that there were flames and smoke coming from one of the trees along the drive. The weather was hot and dry with a stiff south west breeze. It was the height of the bushfire season. Mr Hawke asked his wife to call 000, got his water tanker and pump and arrived at the scene about four minutes later, by which time four to five pine trees were well ablaze. His first instinct was to stop the fire proceeding up the drive towards the cold storage facility, which had a 700 litre above ground tank of diesel fuel approximately 20 metres away from the last pine tree at the top of the driveway. 8. Mr Hawke and his wife did their best to wet the unburned trees near the cold storage facility until they lost electrical power due to the fire. By this stage the fire was spreading quickly through the remaining pine trees down the drive.9. As this fire had occurred during a particularly dangerous period, there were fortuitously a lot of resources available, and the emergency services were able to spring into action. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service, with aerial support, arrived with a number of fire trucks, a helicopter and a plane to fight the fire. A southerly breeze was driving the fire down through the row of trees and the fire was very intense. The heat set an adjoining row of radiata pines alight. This was the second windbreak on the other side of the east-west access to Parkwood. Due to the intensity of the fire from the pine tree windbreak and the separate radiata pine windbreak, and because the fire spread into the paddocks at Parkwood, the Rural Fire Service was unable to obtain vehicle access. A number of grass fires developed in Parkwood over the fields. 10. A total of eight Rural Fire Service units helped fight the fire. Three additional units were sent to Orange Airport to assist with the re-watering of water bombing aircraft. The fixed wing aircraft had been deployed to Orange late on Friday when the Central West was identified as a potentially hazardous area for fires because of the hot weather. A State Forests helicopter, which was fortuitously en route from Bathurst, was called to the scene and also helped carrying out swoops of the area, scooping water from nearby dams. Orange Fire Brigade crews placed themselves between fire and the nearby houses. 11. According to a newspaper report entitled ""Bush Fire Tests Emergency Staff"" (page 457 of the Agreed Bundle): ""At one stage the fire appeared to take hold as it engulfed tall pine trees close to one house, with flames leaping high into the air"".12. The local Inspector of Operations Support, Mr Smith, said that humidity readings under 30%, combined with dry conditions, were conducive to fires, and the current level of about 7% had created a hazardous situation during the past few days. He urged residents to be vigilant about using power tools during the heat of the day and to take steps to ensure safety around houses. The source of the blaze, according to the newspaper report, was a fault in a power pole. This power pole was one of the poles located in the line which ran above the 61 pine trees on Parkwood.The aftermath13. On Friday, 29 November 2002 a tree surgeon, Mr Bruce Smith, was retained by Mr Hawke to provide a professional assessment of the trees and their condition. He provided a report concerning the two windbreaks. He noted the trees in both windbreaks had been in place for many years (60 years for one windbreak and 80 years for the other) and that apart from nine trees in the 61 pine tree windbreak, all had effectively been destroyed. He made a number of recommendations for their removal.14. Following receipt of this report, Mr Hawke made a number of enquiries about suitable trees. He wanted to find the fastest growing trees. In August 2003 he obtained a number of saplings of a different variety (less attractive but faster growing) and he later planted these. However, as Mr Hawke notes in his affidavit of 23 March 2005, although he had planted the fastest growing pine trees he could obtain, it would be 10 to 15 years' time before they reached the kind of 6-7 metre height that would make an effective windbreak and noise insulation.15. Although the trees in question were on the property of Mr Hawke, they also operated as a windbreak for the apple farm next door, “Bonny Glen"". The present owners have run an apple orchard on this site since 1973. Although some other fruit is grown, it is a specialist apple orchard, producing Gala and Granny Smith apple trees. The Granny Smith apple trees were planted more than 30 years ago on seedling root stock, while the Gala apple trees were planted seven years ago on dwarfing root stock. The apple trees in the orchard immediately adjacent to the pine trees were in 21 rows running north to south. The pine trees provided a windbreak for the apple orchard and thereby produced a constant microclimate for apple trees, allowing them to produce apples of very high quality and also permitting the spraying of these trees without the spray penetrating into the adjoining property belonging to the Hawke family.The power line problems16. Above the 61 pine trees which grew on Parkwood, there was a power line. It was the job of the Defendant to lop the pine trees from time to time, to ensure that they were not touching against the power lines. Country Energy had been doing this work for decades. According to the statement of David John Thorn of 9 August 2005, as long ago as 1979 it was noticed that pine trees were growing close to high voltage overhead lines and to minimise the sway of the line, a second pole was put in on Bonny Glen to shorten the span (page 702 of Tender Bundle).17. According to a statement of Mr Peter Thorncraft, of 6 July 2005, Country Energy went to Bonny Glen in January 1993 to lop a row of pines along the boundary using a bucket truck, as the fruit trees were very young. Although it was obvious to Mr Thorncraft that the apple trees were going to get bigger, and that there were already some problems (page 706 of the Tender Bundle) nobody appears to have returned to check the height of the pines, or whether they were brushing against the power lines until approximately 2000, when Mr Thorncraft said he thought he spoke to a person in the orchard who was not Mr or Mrs Hall. He indicated he was checking the trees to see whether they needed lopping, that they did not need lopping at the time, but that at some time in the future ""we will have to look at that"" (page 707 Agreed Bundle).18. There is no evidence that there was any difficulty in 2000, either in access to the property, or need to use a bucket truck. Some of the defendant’s witnesses referred to a history of concern by members of the Hall family about how to go about the cutting back of the trees. In fact, there is very little evidence at all about this 2000 visit and there is no diary entry in relation to whether it was made or what recommendations, if any, were made was produced in evidence.19. All of this changed as a result of a helicopter inspection report filed by Mr Christopher Ronald White on 21 October 2002. Once a year, for about one month, Country Energy engages the services of a helicopter pilot to inspect its line from Blayney through Orange and on to Molong, to identify any defects in the line and any area in which works need to be undertaken to prevent bush fires, such as where trees grow into the lines (Agreed Bundle 718). The crew of the helicopter consists of a pilot, a spotter and a third person who sits with the pilot and navigates from the maps where the pilot is to fly. The spotter focuses on the lines and the poles. If the spotter notices anything, the helicopter pilot swings the helicopter around and returns to that spot so that Mr White can mark exactly on the map where it is located. If there is evidence that the tree may have contacted the power line, such as browning of leaves, he marks the location of that tree on the map and indicates the position with the words ""tree burning"". This does not mean that the tree is actually burning, but rather that the tree has previously contacted the line and there are brown leaves. The presence of browning on trees is urgent, but not as urgent as evidence of smoke or fire. If smoke is observed, then a call is put through on the two-way radio for the situation to be dealt with immediately.20. Mr White prepared a report (Agreed Bundle, page 720) setting out precisely where he saw evidence of ""tree burning"". In the box for ""severity"", he ticked the ""Urgent"" box and he handed it to his supervisor, Bill Venner, for further action the next day.21. Mr Venner's affidavit of 14 July 2005 (Agreed Bundle, page 710) notes that following the helicopter inspection he received a number of maintenance work instruction sheets which he ""separated into the various categories"". Early in November 2002, he gave to Steve Hare and another lopping crew urgent tree loppings to be undertaken, referred to in this helicopter trip.Country Energy visits the properties22. On or about 4 November 2002, three employees of Country Energy drove up to the property and parked on the road outside Bonny Glen and Parkwood. Mr Hare's evidence was that Mr Fardell, the linesman and driver, began boiling the billy for morning tea while he walked up what he called the ""semi trailer access road"" of Bonny Glen. He came across a person whom he could not identify, other than to say he was a young man. Having seen all the relevant members of the Hall family in the witness box, it would be fair to say that none of them could be described as looking like a ""young man"" (Agreed Bundle, pages 693, para 18 and 694, para 20) but it transpired that it was in fact a member of the Hall family.23. This young man, whose name Mr Hare did not bother to note, said ""You're not driving your truck in here. You'll damage my trees"".  
     
     Mr Hare says he said ""I have to get in there. We have a report of the trees being the near the mains"". 
     
     
     The young man said ""You won't get a big truck through here. I don't want you to damage the trees"".  
      
      
     Mr Hare said ""Okay, not a problem. I will go back and report it"". 
    24. According to Mr Hare's affidavit, he saw a barbed wire fence near the substation and there was no gate in this barbed wire fence.25. Despite the report being described as ""urgent"", Mr Hare did not pass this on, not did he remain on the property. He went back and told his two co-workers that ""they"" would not let the Country Energy truck down there (according to Mr Littlefield) and that they would not let ""us"" down there (according to Mr Fardel) (Agreed Bundle, pages 690, 698). The gang returned to the depot and at lunch time Mr Hare went to see Mr Venner.26. Mr Bernard Hall gave evidence and identified himself as the person in the packing shed who spoke to Mr Hare. He said that two people came and he showed them three access points to the pine trees. He said he noticed that they were wearing Country Energy logos on their clothing. One of the men asked him ""How do we get to the power lines?"" He showed them the pathway to the power lines which were situated on Bonny Glen and run along the border of Bonny Glen and the neighbouring property of Parkwood. He said that one of the men said it was ""a bit hard to get access to cut the pine trees back"" and he asked why they did not get ladders. One of the men replied ""We cannot because of OHS issues"". 27. Mr Hall suggested long poles with saws, but the man said ""It's all too hard"".  
     
      
     He replied: ""They're your wires, do what you got to do [sic] I have to go"". 
      
      
     The man said: ""We have to go back to town to discuss it further"". 
    28. During this conversation the Country Energy men pointed out to Mr Hall some burnt, singing and browning on the branches and needles of the pine trees but did not tell Mr Hall that they need for the work had been described as urgent. In fact it was Mr Hare's evidence that he did not believe that there was any risk that if he did not do the work that there would be a fire, and he denied that the situation was in fact urgent at all.29. The following occurred at T-372-373: 
     
     ""Q. Then when you said ""we have to get in there, we have a report of the trees being near the mains"" had you formed your opinion that there wasn't a problem or not? 
      
     A. No, well, the trees were near the mains. 
     
     
     Q. Lots of trees are near mains. 
      
     A. That's correct. 
     
     
     Q. Weren't you trying to convey to this person that you needed to get in there urgently because there was a problem? 
      
     A. I did explain that the trees needed to be lopped. 
     
     
     Q. Did they need to be lopped or not? 
      
     A. Yes, they did need to be lopped. 
     
     
     Q. And the reason they needed to be lopped was because there was a real risk of them touching the wires? 
      
     A. That's a possibility. Well, it is a possibility, it all depends if you've got weather factors-- 
     
     
     Q. It's the only reason they need to be lopped, isn't it, you don't run around lopping trees if there is not a possibility of them touching wires, do you? 
      
     A. Yes, we do. 
     
     
     Q. Why do you do that? 
      
     A. Because if there's a risk that they're within half a foot or say half a metre or a metre we still get a report to go and lop those trees. 
     
     
     Q. Where did these trees stand, half a foot, half a metre, touching, what's the position? 
      
     A. I can't really remember now. I don't know, I'm only surmising but it could be 300, I can't remember. 
     
     
     Q. When you say you're only surmising that's because you don't remember at all, do you? 
      
     A. Well, no, I can't remember that specific distance. 
     
     
     Q. You're making up your evidence when you say that you formed some opinion that there wasn't urgency required? 
      
     A. No, I'm not. 
     
     
     Q. When you spoke to Mr Venner did you tell him, look, this urgent maintenance work instruction you've given us isn't really urgent? 
      
     A. No, I didn't say that at all. 
     
     
     Q. That's because you hadn't formed that opinion, I suggest to you? 
      
     A. Yes. 
     
     
     Q. You're just making it up now, aren't you? 
      
     A. No, I'm not, no. 
     
     
     HER HONOUR: I don't think he understood that question. 
     
     
     NEWLINDS: Yes, I'll do it again. 
     
     
     HER HONOUR:  
      
     Q. Sir, look, you need to listen carefully to the questions otherwise you'll give an answer that will confuse us. 
     
     
     NEWLINDS: 
      
     Q. Can I do it this way, sir, can I ask you to go to paragraph 25 of your affidavit? 
      
     A. Yes. 
     
     
     Q. This is the conversation you say you have after you leave Bonny Glen and you speak to Mr Venner? 
      
     A. Yes. 
     
     
     Q. You don't in that conversation set out you saying anything like, by the way Bill, it's not a problem because the wires aren't anywhere near the trees, do you? 
      
     A. No, I don't, no. 
      
      
     Q. And you don't say, by the way, Bill, even though the maintenance instruction report says this is an urgent job it's actually not urgent, do you? 
      
     A. No. 
     
     
     Q. That's because you hadn't formed that opinion at the time, isn't it? 
      
     A. I formed the opinion that everything was okay at that stage. 
     
     
     Q. Why didn't you tell Mr Venner that? 
      
     A. I just - I don't know, I never said that. 
     
     
     Q. You're just trying to, with the benefit of hindsight, explain why you didn't do something you should've at the time, aren't you? 
      
     A. No. 
     
     
     Q. You're making up an excuse, aren't you? 
      
     A. No. 
     
     
     Q. You knew that this was an urgent situation at the time, didn't you? 
      
     A. No. 
     
     
     Q. You knew that it was bushfire weather at the time, didn't you? 
      
     A. In summer time, yeah, that's when most fires are prone. 
     
     
     Q. And it was dry at the time? 
      
     A. As far as I can remember. 
     
     
     Q. And you knew that if the pine trees burnt down there would be significant damage caused to the orchard? 
      
     A. No. 
     
     
     Q. Why do you say that? 
      
     A. Well who's to say the pine trees were going to burn down? 
     
     
     Q. The question was, you knew that if the pine trees burnt down there'd be significant damage to the orchard? 
      
     A. No."" 
    30. Mr Hare's evidence about the trees was at times hard to follow. At one stage his evidence was that the trees were too close together for the trucks to get between them (T-373.45-.47) but on the other hand they were wide apart enough for fire not to jump from the pine trees to the apple trees (T-375-376).31. When determining whose evidence to accept about what happened on this visit, I should have regard to what happened next.32. On 7 November 2002 Mr Venner and Mr Thorn went to Bonny Glen. Mr Venner's evidence is that he had a conversation with Mr Fred Hall to the effect that Mr Hall refused to allow access because Mr Hall was not prepared to allow any lopping or pruning of the pine trees. Unlike Mr Hare, he said that he told Mr Fred Hall that the situation was dangerous.33. Mr Thorncraft gave evidence he heard Mr Venner say to Mr Hall ""We need to cut those trees back, can we get in?"" to which Mr Hall replied: ""If you cut the extremities of the branches, you'll leave a hole"". When Mr Thorncraft said that they would not cut back as far as that, Mr Hall replied that what they were going to do would ""look horrible"". This version is inconsistent with the version of Mr Venner, as is the evidence of Mr Thorn. All of the defendant's witnesses give a version of events which is different to the version of the conversation given by Mr Fred Hall. Mr Hall said that Mr Venner complained of having trouble getting access past the tennis court to access the top section of the trees, to which Mr Hall replied ""Well you have managed every other time"" and that he said ""Do what you've got to do"" but went on to tell them that if they cut more than 18 inches off the trees, the trees would suffer from die back. Mr Venner then spoke on the mobile to someone who Mr Hall believed was David Thorn, and then said that David Thorn would come out.34. Mr Thorn told Mr Fred Hall that he would have to speak to his boss, but that the pine trees had grown a lot since the last time he was out and that other solutions would have to be looked at. He then discussed some of those options with Mr Fred Hall. He then said he would go over to speak to David Hawke to see if he could put power lines on the other side of the pine trees. Tim Hall said to David Thorn words to the effect ""Don't let those boys go until they finish cutting the pines back"".35. According to Mr Hawke's affidavit, either Bernard or Timothy Hall telephoned Mr Hawke to say a person from Country Energy was coming over to talk to Mr Hawke about the power lines near the pine trees. David Thorn then went to Mr Hawke's home and said to him:  
     
     ""I have an air surveillance report which was taken two weeks ago showing the close proximity of the power lines to a row of pine trees which are located on the north western corner of your property. These branches of the pine trees are touching the power lines and are posing a potential hazard, and I would like to know whether you would consider the re-routing of the power lines in through your property on the other side of the pine trees up the front drive of Parkwood."" 
    36. Mr Thorn went on to say, and I find these words decisive: ""At some stage we will need to re-route the power lines as the trimming of the branches is only a bandaid solution to the current situation"".37. Mr Hawke asked if there was any other option that was available, like insulated power lines, and was told these were not considered financially viable by Country Energy. Mr Hawke said he would think it over but if that was the only option he would probably agree. Mr Thorn said that he would get back to contact Mr Hawke in the near future and he would go from there. Later that day Mr Hawke spoke to his wife. Re-routing the wires would not look attractive, but they would not be able to see the wires from the house, so they agreed that this was what they would say when Country Energy got back to them.38. Mr Hawke went on to say, in his evidence and in his affidavit, and again I find this persuasive, that ""David Thorn never indicated to me that there was ever any urgency to decide whether I consented to the moving of the power lines"". He believed that based on his conversation with David Thorn, Country Energy would leave the power lines in a safe condition in the interim until a decision on the re-routing of the power lines was made. As it happened, the fire occurred on Sunday, three days later.39. There are number of reasons why I should prefer the evidence of Mr Hawke and the members of the Hall family to the employees of Country Energy. First of all, Mr Fred Hall said that the width between the pine trees and the tennis courts was about 15 feet wide. He never had a problem with trees encroaching upon his driveway because he kept them trimmed back, always ensuring he never cut back more than 18 inches to avoid die back (see Mr Hall's affidavit, pages 131-136).40. In contrast, Mr Venner's evidence was that the pine trees were entirely blocking the path between the pine trees and apple trees (T-404), a position adopted by Mr Hare until it was pointed out to him that the fire could leap from the pine trees to the apple trees, whereupon he said there was a 2 metre gap. In other words, there was inconsistent evidence from employees of the defendant as to how wide this gap was – anywhere from almost no gap at all to a 2 metre gap.41. There is nothing in any of the expert reports to support the contention that the base of these pine trees, or the size of the apple trees, could have increased so significantly in the 18 months between Country Energy's previous visit and November 2002.42. Further, it emerged during the trial that the defendant had a number of reports concerning this incident which it had, for reasons unknown to me, elected not to discover. The one document it was prepared to discover is consistent with the version given by Mr Hall and not with the version given by the defendant's employees. I set out the text of Exhibit M in full:

       Subject: Re: Fire at Woodward Rd, Orange 
       
      
     
     
     Rick, 
      
     Aerial patrols were carried out in the Orange area during September / October 2002. Subsequent to the patrols a defect was raised for ""Tree near line"" at the property concerned. 
      
     Both customers share a common substation. The trees are on Mr Hawke's property, right on the boundary to Mr Halls. The 11KV power line supplying the substation runs parallel to the trees on Mr Halls property. 
      
     On the other side of the power line Mr Hall has an extensive orchard and tennis court making access to the power line extremely difficult. 
      
     Staff went out to clear the defect on about Thursday 8th November in an EPV (Bucket truck). They found that the only access to the defect site was to drive between the trees and Mr Halls tennis court. Mr Hall expressed concern about the need to clear some branches from the trees to enable access, advising staff that if they cut more than 300mm from the trees they would be severely damaged. Staff decided it was not worth the risk of offending the customer and advised their supervisor that alternative arrangements would need to be made. 
      
     Orange design staff attended to site the next day (Friday 9th November) to try to work through options with both Mr Hall and Mr Hawke (EG line relocation, HV ABC etc) being aware that the trees had literally been of growing concern (pardon the pun) for a number of years. The outcome of this was for design staff to come back with firm options and quotes etc. 
      
     On Sunday 11th November it appears that an arc was drawn between one of the 11kv conductors and one of trees approximately 50meters [sic] from the substation. It is believed that due to the drought conditions the trees had a high amount of sap on their leaves making them both more conductive and more flammable than usual. The arcing started a fire on one of the trees which, in a matter of minutes had spread to the entire row. 
      
     The heat generated from the blaze was sufficient to melt the tar on an adjacent road and possibly caused damage to a small number of fruit trees on Mr Halls property. 
      
     Rural Fire service volunteers attended and extinguished the fire before any other significant damage occurred, however it is also apparent that a number of other fruit trees belonging to Mr Hall were also damaged by fire fighters needing to gain access to the fire. 
      
     Aside from the extensive damage to the trees Mr Hawke suffered from some damage to fences and lost approximately 5 hectares of pasture (however no stock were apparent). 
      
     I met with both Mr Hawke and Mr Hall on site on Friday 16th. I explained (and still believe) that the fire could have been avoided had Mr Hall given access to the trees and allowed staff to do their job on the day. Mr Hall was adamant that he did not prevent staff accessing the trees, he merely advised them that by doing so would significantly damage the trees. Mr Hall has some history of being rather difficult and complaining frequently about our lopping methods (hence staff reluctance to gain access and the quick response from design staff). 
      
     I further advised that we would pay to get the trees examined by a qualified tree surgeon to determine if the trees could be saved and depending on that look at further options. 
      
     The tree surgeons report has been returned and he has advised that the trees are completely ruined. I have not yet had further contact with either Mr Hall or Mr Hawke.

     As discussed this morning, we are in receipt of Solicitors letters relating to potential claims from David Hawke and Frederick and Pamela Hall, Woodward Road Orange. The letters relate to a fire on their properties on 10 November 2002. 
     
     
     Could you supply a report (email will be fine) on the matter and amongst other things, include coverage of the following points. 
      
     • Details of Powerline inspections carried out in November. 
      
     • Mettings [sic] held with the landowners in November to discuss vegetation clearing (I understand that one of them was difficult to deal with and refused entry to their property to trim the trees). 
      
     • Details of the clearance between powerline and trees 
      
     • Any details you have on the fire, including the extent of damage and our potential liability  
      
     • Anything we have done since the fire including any meetings, discussions or correspondence we may have had with the landowners. 
      
     • Any other reports associated with the matter. 
     
     
     I realise your [sic] busy but if possible could I have your report by COB Wednesday, 19 February so we can supply a timely response.

     43. Thus, this document notes there is no record of Mr Hall having denied access in the emphatic version that is put forward. It accords with Mr Hall’s evidence that he simply did not want the trees cut back too much. Mr Hall's concern was, of course, that if the trees were cut back too much, this would be bad for the trees because it would lead to die back. Furthermore, the problem with these trees was that they had been known to Country Energy as a ‘growing concern’ for some years and that the design team was therefore asked to look at alternatives to trimming the trees.44. I also note the unchallenged evidence of Fred Hall that after the fire had been extinguished, a man named Philip, wearing Country Energy clothing, arrived at Bonny Glen and cut back some of the dead limbs on the burnt pine trees. He used a cherry picker to do this. Mr Fred Hall said this man said to him words to the effect: ""I don't know what they [Country Energy] were going on about; I had no trouble getting access to cut the pines back"".45. In addition, both the Fire Brigade and Country Energy were able to obtain access to the trees and to trim the surviving pine trees, in circumstances where it is clear from the description of the fire that their access to Parkwood was blocked because of the fires and the burning of the other line of trees.46. Finally, all of the witnesses were shown a hand-drawn map prepared on behalf of the plaintiffs, showing at least three methods of access to the line of trees. I do not propose to go into any more detail concerning the inconsistent and at times evasive answers given by the witnesses called by the defendant. It is sufficiently apparent from the transcript. On one occasion when I asked Mr Venner to say how close the apple and pine trees were, all he would say to me was ""I wouldn't like to speculate"", ""I wouldn't like to guess"" and when I asked him to hold up his hands to try to indicate how far apart they were, he refused even to do this (T-405-406).47. The defendant, in written submissions, asked the rhetorical question: ""Why would the defendant's employees have come out on two separate occasions if they simply did not want to do work?"" The answer from the evidence is that there was a work requisition relating to urgent tree lopping that needed to be done because tree browning at a time of very great fire risk was a matter of urgency, so they had to be there. However, they were not just there to cut a browned pine tree back and to go away again. The reason that the more senior employee, Mr Thorn, was brought out to the scene on the second occasion was because Mr Thorn knew that the lopping of the trees was only a “bandaid” solution (to use the word he used to Mr Hawke) and ultimately what needed to happen was re-routing the power lines through the property on the other side. (This was Country Energy’s preference. Mr Hawke wanted something more aesthetic, but Mr Thorn made it clear Country Energy’s budget did not extend to this.)48. In addition, although much was made by the defendant’s witnesses of the question of whether or not there had been talk of cutting the apple trees in order to do the job, there is no reference to this in Exhibit M.49. Country Energy knew it had a difficult problem on its hands. The branches of the pine trees were touching the power lines and there was browning. There were 61 trees, of roughly equal height and age. Given the height and length of the trees, Country Energy wanted to find another solution to the bandaid solution of trimming up to 61 trees. Unfortunately, before anything could be done, the trees in question burned down.50. The trees in question were on Parkwood, not on Bonny Glen. It is apparent from Exhibit M, where there is talk of pleasing the customer (which is a reference to the Hall family, not to the Hawke family), that they knew the row of trees was important to both properties. If there really had been some resistance from Mr Hall to permitting entry to trim the trees, one wonders why this was not raised with Mr Hawke by Mr Thorn. However, it is clear from what Mr Thorn says to Mr Hawke that Country Energy was really looking to re-route the power lines, rather than trimming the trees, and this is the most likely explanation as to why the trimming of the trees was not done. This would also explain why Mr Hare did not think the job was urgent.51. Exhibits 5 and 6 are two diaries which were not produced on discovery but which were belatedly provided during the hearing. Exhibit 6 is a diary which appears to have been used almost entirely for work roster notes and occasional reference to Country Energy activities, such as the ""Big Breakfast"" on 14 May. There are no entries at all between 5 June and 7 November. The entry for 7 November has clearly been written in at some later date and is a self-serving statement. The entry from the diary, which is Exhibit 5, contains no information of assistance, beyond confirming the identity of the three people who were working on 4 November.52. I have referred elsewhere in this judgment to the problems caused by inadequate or belated discovery. I have also referred to the inference that may be drawn when documents that are not produced on discovery are documents which ought to be expected to be in existence. At least one of the defendant's witnesses referred to the preparation of a formal report on the fire. No such report was provided, either in discovery or during the trial.53. The plaintiff invites me to find that Mr Hare, on his first visit, was simply being lazy. While I find that Mr Hare was not denied access on the day, and there was no physical impediment to the work being done, I find that Mr Hare went there without appreciating the urgency of the situation, as he himself conceded, and that he did nothing for this reason. In addition, if the trees were known as a ‘growing concern’ to Country Energy employees, he may not have seen the need to be trimming the trees.54. On the second visit Mr Hall told the Country Energy employees not to cut the pine trees back more than 18 inches. They had been in touch with Mr Thorn and by this stage, Country Energy was looking for other alternatives to the difficult and risky task of cutting a very long line of very tall pine trees. In this regard, I accept as correct Mr Hall’s version of what was said to him about occupational health and safety and other problems. It was in fact regarded as a job that was ""too hard"" and some alternative would have to have been found.55. In fact, at all relevant times there were three points of access to the pine trees (see Exhibit A) and if any of these had been used to trim the pine trees around the power lines, as a short term measure, while looking into the long term measure, the fire would have been prevented. Was the defendant negligent?56. It is not in dispute, and should not be in dispute, that Country Energy owed a duty of care as the owner of power lines and a retail supplier of electricity pursuant to the Electricity Supply Act 1995 (NSW). It has an obligation to remove dangers such as browning pine trees which are proximate to power lines, pursuant to s.9 of the Electricity Supply (Safety and Network Management) Regulations 2002. The obligation to minimise the possibility of fire included an obligation to trim pine trees in the manner that they had trimmed them over the 35 years that their officers had been entering Bonny Glen for this purpose. Country Energy in fact had a statutory right of entry, even if Bonny Glen's employees or owners refused to permit this. This is a clear case of ‘general reliance’ of the kind discussed by the High Court in Pyrenees Shire Council v Day (1998) 192 CLR 330.57. The defendant’s employees had surveyed the proximity of the trees to the power lines pursuant to this duty, and obtained surveillance reports showing there was an urgent problem with tree burning. They knew that there was not only a short term problem requiring a “bandaid” solution, but also a long term problem that the wires needed to be relocated.58. The defendant's assertions that it was unable to trim the pine trees due to the conduct of the plaintiff’s employees, either by allowing its fruit trees to grow to block the access, or by refusing access to the premises, or both, is an argument that I have rejected. Even if I had found that access was rejected, the defendant had a statutory right to enter Bonny Glen to maintain the power lines. In a country such as Australia, where bush fires are a grave danger, not simply to one property owner but to all those around them, that statutory right was available to be used and should have been used if in fact there had been a refusal. What is more astonishing than anything else is that Mr Hawke, the owner of the property in which the trees were growing, was never asked for his permission, nor was he ever told of any allegation of denial of access.59. A submission has been made that Country Energy was absolved from accessing and pruning the trees due to economic constraints. Since I find that at all relevant times they were given access, and that there was at least one and probably three methods of access to the premises, this is not an argument that I need to consider, other than briefly. 60. First, I note that no evidence has been adduced by the defendant of its financial position or any financial constraints placed on it at the relevant time. Nor is there any information as to what financial burden would be incurred by the defendant’s employees essentially just performing the work they had been employed to do.61. Secondly, there had been no difficulty or significant expense involved in trimming the trees in previous years. 62. In addition, the defendant had the financial capacity to consider what must have been much more expensive options such as the re-routing of the whole power line. While I have no information as to the cost of this, commonsense would dictate that it would be more significant than the cost of trimming the pine trees. Accordingly I do not accept the contention that financial constraints meant that, if the Halls had in fact prevented them entering the property (which I find they did not do) the defendant’s financial constraints prevented it from entering pursuant to its statutory obligation.63. The defendant submits that the presence of negligence must include a finding of unreasonable conduct by reason of s.5B of the Civil Liability Act. It was submitted that any delay on behalf of Country Energy (which was effectively a delay of several weeks following receipt of the urgent report of tree burning) must be weighed against ""the environment in which they work"" (written submissions paragraph 15), in particular, dealing with customers whose wishes they take into account. It is submitted that Country Energy could not, acting reasonably, ignore the wishes and property of its customers. 64. This submission is easily defeated when one considers the total failure of Country Energy to consider the wishes and property of the owners of the property on which the pine trees were situated. They were never consulted about these access problems, nor were they ever told about the urgency of the situation. The unchallenged evidence of Mr Hawke is a strong answer to any argument of unreasonableness. Further, I have indicated that I have accepted the evidence of the Hall family that they did not prevent the access to the property, and that there was at least one and probably three means of access to the trees. All that the Hall family members were concerned about was that the trees be trimmed in an appropriate manner so that the trees did not develop die back, as the defendant’s internal email subsequent to the fire noted.65. It is further submitted that assessing the relative culpability of the parties (Podrebersek v AIS Pty Ltd (1985) 59 ALR 529) that the plaintiff's share of the responsibility is not less than the defendant's.66. I have indicated that I prefer the evidence of members of the Hall family to the evidence of the defendants. I am satisfied that at all relevant times not only were the defendant's employees given access to the property, and that there were at least one and probably three methods of access to the pine trees, but that the only condition that was ever placed on a cutting of the pine trees was that they should not do so in such a way as to endanger the pine trees by causing them to suffer die back. Since this could have led to the same or a similar result to the trees burning down in a fire, this was not an unrealistic or unreasonable expectation on the part of the plaintiff.67. Finally, it is submitted that there must be a finding that the fire was caused by contact with the wires. It is conceded that the evidence to this effect comes from the Wildfire investigation report (Exhibit L) and the Country Energy investigation (Exhibit M) which raise clear inferences as to the cause of the fire.68. The defendant has noted in written submissions at paragraph 19 the criticism that has been made during the hearing of the inadequacy of its documents and discovery. It is noted that no challenge was made to the adequacy of discovered documents before the matter came to court. However, in practical terms, the bringing of an application for further and better discovery is always a difficult task. The fact remains that the two documents which conclusively establish the cause of the fire were produced only during the hearing and not on discovery. The obligation to give discovery arises from the obligations that parties have to discover documents in accordance with obligations placed not only on parties who litigate, but also upon legal practitioners who advise them. The system of discovery in adversary litigation is often referred to by researchers as being one of the strengths of the adversarial system and one of the reasons why it should be preferred to the inquisitorial system, where the Courts can compel the production of documents and use methods of evidence gathering upon the parties (see for example Posner ""An economic approach to the law of evidence"" (1999) 51 Stanford Law Review 1477). It is all the more regrettable, then, that a party possessing documents clearly relevant to the issue of liability should not discover them and then, when the issue is raised at trial, disgorge them during the hearing one by one, like Atalanta’s apples.69. The defendant in written submissions appears to concede the cause of the fire was contact by the tree with the wires. This obviates the need for me to draw an Allen v Tobias (1957 – 58) 98 CLR 367 inference in relation to this issue. If I have erred in my interpretation of the defendant’s submissions, I would draw the inference by presuming the facts against the defendant in the manner explained by Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Williams JJ at 375 that the defendant is “without the corroboration which might have been expected in his case”. I also note the circumstances in which such documents were produced only at the trial is an issue that is relevant to costs.The issue of liability in contract70. The plaintiff further claims that the plaintiff and defendant entered into a contract for supply of electricity. In order for the defendant to comply with that contract, it has to run power lines across its customer's land. This includes not only the plaintiff's land, but also the adjoining property. It is submitted it must be an implied term of such a contract that the power is provided to the customer in a safe manner so as not to cause damage to the customer's property.71. The plaintiff submits that in order for a term to be implied into a contract, it needs to satisfied the four criteria set out in Codelfa Constructions Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales (1982) 149 CLR 337. The defendant submits that a term will not generally be implied into a contract unless the five conditions set out in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 16 ALR 363 are made out. The defendant submits that the terms sought to be implied fall outside the established conditions referred to and are ""too broad"" to be implied into the contract (written submissions paragraph 11).72. In Chappell v Hart (1998) 195 CLR 2 McHugh J at [23] notes: 
     
     ""Proof of a cause of action in negligence or contract requires the plaintiff to prove that the breach of duty by the defendant caused the particular damage that the plaintiff suffered. In civil cases, causation theory operates on the hypothesis that the defendant has breached a duty owed to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff has suffered injury; but causation theory insists that the plaintiff prove that the injury is relevantly connected to the breach of duty. The existence of the relevant causal connection is determined according to commonsense ideas and not according to philosophical or scientific theories of causation."" 
    73. While at times claims brought under the Civil Liability Act for negligence are coupled with claims brought in contract, both the parties and the courts tend to treat the contract claim somewhat informally as being an alternative claim for the same sort of damages. In Gharibian v Propix Pty Ltd T/as Jamberoo Recreational Park [2007] NSWCA 151 Ipp JA at [75] noted that ""there was no difference in substance between the appellant's claim in negligence and her claim in contract"" and if the claim in negligence failed, so did the claim in contract. This was a case where the plaintiff had purchased a ticket to ride on a toboggan run and not only was the existence of the contract admitted, but no challenge was made to any implied term that the toboggan run had to be conducted in a safe manner so as not to cause damage or injury. In Harriton v Stephens (2004) 59 NSWLR 694 at [208] the Court of Appeal noted the similar position concerning the heads of damages claimed. The parties in their submissions to me in this case did not differentiate between the damages claimed for breach of contract and for negligence so I have not done so either.74. There are two kinds of implied terms. The first is the kind of term which the law would find to be a part of a particular class of contract, either by common law or statute, although those terms may not find specific expression in contractual statements or documents of the parties, and terms which are to be implied into a contract to give effect to the presumed intention of the party. Terms which can be implied to give effect to the presumed intention of the parties can be further subdivided into four groups. These are terms implied by custom or usage in a particular trade, industry or locality; terms implied from a prior course of dealing; terms implied where the principal terms have been settled but subsidiary terms are absent; and terms which are implied to give efficacy to the particular contract.75. The onus for showing that the criteria has been of the kind set out in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266 at 282-283 lies on the party asserting the implied term. The more detailed and comprehensive the contract, the less ground for supposing the parties have failed to address their minds to the question at issue. In addition, there is the question of identifying with any degree of certainty the terms which the parties would have settled upon had they considered the question (Codelfa Constructions Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 346).76. I now consider each of these criteria.(a) Equitable and reasonable77. Such a requirement refers to fairness as between the parties and is to be judged by reference to the benefits and burdens each party can expect to enjoy or undertake under the contract. In BP Refinery, the majority of the Privy Council rejected a proposed implication of a term into a rating agreement requiring a continuity of corporate identity on the basis that this would deprive the appellant of a benefit which induced it to make a major capital investment in the council's activities. It needs to be said that the provision of electricity is not something that the plaintiff could have obtained from any other source. In terms of reasonableness and equitableness, the plaintiff would be entitled to assume that the electricity was supplied in a safe fashion.(b) Necessity to give business efficacy to the contract78. The case law does not offer much in the way of analysis of the phrases ""effective operation"" or ""business efficacy"" and perhaps the best test is to look at the statement of Bowen LJ in The Moorcock (1889) 14 PD 64 at 68 that the idea is to give such business efficacy to the transaction “as must have been intended at all events by both parties who are businessmen"". In other words, the term must not be so necessary that without the term the contract would to all purposes be ineffective but that the term must be necessary to make the contract effective and workable, having regard to the presumed intention of the parties.(c) So obvious it goes without saying79. The requirement for obviousness is best tested by asking whether the parties would readily have agreed on the imposed implied term if it had been suggested to them in the course of their negotiations: Codelfa at 374 per Aickin J.(d) Capable of clear expression80. This has two elements. First, the parties would have agreed if it had been drawn to their intention (see Codelfa at 356) and, second, that it would be a reasonable provision capable of being formulated with a sufficient degree of precision. I note the helpful summary of authorities by Einstein J in Biscayne Partners Pty Ltd v Valance Corporation Pty Ltd and Ors [2003] NSWSC 874 at [52] on this issue. An implied term that services be provided to a customer in a safe manner so as not to cause damage to a customer or the customer's property is clearly such a term.(e) Consistency with express terms81. There is no evidence before me of any term in the contract for supply of electricity which would be inconsistent with an implied term to provide the electricity in a safe manner so as not to cause damage to the customer or his property.82. Further, in relation to the obligation to co-operate in a performance of contractual obligations as part of the law of New South Wales, I note the cases collected by Einstein J in Biscayne at [64].83. For Country Energy to supply electricity, it has to run power lines across land that is owned by its customers. It has statutory obligations as to how to go about this task. Electricity is highly dangerous. In those circumstances, given its statutory obligations, the requirement that it do so in a safe manner must be so obvious that it goes without saying.84. Finally, I note that statutory counts referred to in the statement of claim are not relied upon as giving rise to a statutory cause of action, but rather that breaches of the Electricity Supply Act 1995 are relied upon to establish breach of duty of care in relation to negligence.85. I find that Country Energy breached its duty of care by failing to take reasonable care and that this failure related not only to failure to trim the pine trees, but failure to take other steps to prevent the fire. I also find that the defendant is in breach of its contractual obligations to the plaintiff in that there was an implied term that the provision of power occur in a safe manner so as not to damage the customer's property.86. The plaintiff’s claims in negligence and breach of contract are therefore made out, and I now consider the issue of damages.Damages87. The principle governing damages in relation to breach of duty is to restore the plaintiff to its former position and the principle in relation to damages in contract is to put the plaintiff in the position as he would have been had the contract been performed. I have referred elsewhere to the tendency of courts to come to the same result for each cause of action when considering claims under the Civil Liability Act with an alternative claim in contract. What the plaintiff must establish is that the defendant's negligence caused or materially contributed to injury or damage suffered by the plaintiff. In the present case, that includes not only repairing and replacing lost or damaged property, but also recovering economic loss as a consequence of injury to the property where that property is income producing.88. The plaintiff submits firstly that it was reasonably foreseeable that the pine trees represented a fire hazard that could and should have been remedied by cutting the trees back. If the fire hazard was not remedied it was reasonably foreseeable that the trees would burn and that property, including the property of the first plaintiff, would suffer damage. This would include not only damage to the apple trees, but also any consequential loss. This includes damaged irrigation pipes and fittings, replacement of damaged fencing and the replacement of apple trees. This was the immediate consequence of the fire. In addition, a claim is made for past and future economic loss on the basis that the destruction of the pine trees, which created a windbreak and a climate conducive to apple growing, effectively destroyed the value of this apple field, resulting in the need for the apple trees to be cut down.89. As senior counsel for the defendant points out in his concise and helpful submissions on quantum, the damages flowing from any established negligence fall into two categories (category 1 and category 2 damages). The first of these is the direct effect of the fire such as the burnt apple trees, their future value, the fruit lost in the fire and the cost of repairing fire damage. Apart from issues of quantum, this was not the subject of substantial dispute. A second category is the indirect effect of the fire, including the loss arising from the plaintiff's alleged inability to spray the apple trees which was asserted to be the reason for their consequent removal from the field. Such loss should probably be regarded as pure economic loss, argues the defendant, given that it is not causally related to any property damage suffered by the plaintiff.90. The ambit of each of the damages claims has been set out in an equally helpful schedule prepared for the plaintiff. I see no point in restating the contents of this schedule, as it would be difficult to do so in any shorter form, because the evidence involved is considerable. Accordingly, I now set out the plaintiff's schedule of damages in full.Plaintiff's summary of damages 
     
     LIQUIDATED DAMAGES 
      
     1. The purchase price of apple trees on seedling, semi dwarf or dwarf root stock is approximately $20 per tree

     ). 
      
      
     2. The total cost of replacing the apple trees totally destroyed in the Fire: 
      
      
      a. 28 gala trees x $20 per tree =  
      $560.00; 
       
        
       
      b. 30 granny smith trees x $20 per tree =

     3. The total cost of replacing: 
      
      
      a. all the gala apple trees in the Affected Area: 218 trees x $20 per tree =  
      $4,360.00; 
       
        
       
      b. all the granny smith apple trees in the Affected Area (note to produce the same annual fruit yield as 80 seedling rootstock granny smith apple trees, an orchardist would need to plant about 300 semi dwarf rootstock granny smith apple trees): 300 trees x $20 per tree =  
      $6,000.00;

      Total = $6,360.00 
      
       
      
     4. The Fire destroyed the fence that ran between Bonny Glen and Parkwood. The fence has been replaced 
      (Affidavit Timothy Hall 24.7.06 vol 1, tab 18 para 38,39 page 178) 
      for the sum of  
     $1,200

     5. The Fire destroyed some sections of irrigation pipes that ran between each row of apple trees in the Affected Area 
      (Affidavit Timothy Hall 24.7.06 vol 1, tab 18 para 40 page 178) 
     . The total cost of materials and labour to replace the irrigation pipes destroyed in the fire was

     7. The following table sets out the total yield of  
     granny smith apples lost 
      as a result of the destruction of the 8 granny smith apple trees and the damage to 8 granny smith apple trees. The figures in the table assume that the windbreak provided by the Pine Trees had not been destroyed or was immediately replaced (note: to produce the same annual fruit yield as 80 seedling rootstock granny smith apple trees, an orchardist would need to plant about 300 semi dwarf rootstock granny smith apple trees:

     9. There are two main markets for apples: 
      
      
      a. the wholesale market is the market for the sale of fully matured premium quality apples; 
       
        
       
      b. the manufacturer’s market is the market for apples of inferior quality that can be used for or are made into juices, preserves, pies, dried fruits etc 
       (Part 2.6 of Report by Mr Collett 9.10.06 vol 2, tab 31 page 636 
      ). 
      
      
     10. During the period from in or about 1990 to 2002 granny smith apples were sold in 18 kilogram cases. Since 2003 all granny smith apples have been sold in 12 kilogram cases. Gala apples have always been sold in 12 kilogram cases 
      (Affidavit of Timothy Hall 24.7.06 paragraph 24 vol 1, tab 19 page 176 
     ). 
      
      
     11. As at the date of the Fire, the granny smith apple trees on the Affected Area were fully matured and approximately 50 to 60 years old. The gala apple trees in the Affected Area were approximately 9 years old 
      (Affidavit Frederick Hall 4.7.06 paragraph 31 vol 1, tab 14 page 140 
     ). These apple trees were picked once a year and: 
      
      
      a. the granny smith apple trees produced approximately 320 kg of apples per tree per year 
       (Affidavit Frederick Hall 4.7.06 paragraph 32 vol 1, tab 14 page 140; Affidavit of Timothy Hall 24.7.06 paragraph 12(a) vol 1, tab 19 page 173 
      ); 
       
        
          
        
       
      b. the gala apple trees produced between approximately 58.5 kg 
       (Affidavit Frederick Hall 4.7.06 paragraph 32 vol 1, tab 14 page 140; Affidavit Frederick Hall 24.3.05 paragraph 359 vol 1, tab 11 page 48; affidavit of Timothy Hall 24.7.06 paragraph 12(b) vol 1, tab 19 page 173)  
       of apples per tree per year. 
      
      
     12. The costs per case incurred by Bonny Glen in relation to treating, picking, storing packing, transporting (freight and levies) and selling (commissions) of gala and granny smith apples for the wholesale market: 
      
      
      a. Gala $10.87 per case; 
       
        
       
      b. Granny smith $10.09 per case 
       (Part 2.5 of Report by Mr Collett 9.10.06 vol 2, tab 31 page 636; affidavit of Timothy Hall 24.7.06 paragraphs 19 – 28 vol 1, tab 18 pages 175 - 177 
      ). 
      
      
     13. The costs per bin incurred by Bonny Glen in relation to treating, picking, storing packing, transporting (freight and levies) and selling (commissions) of gala and granny smith apples for the manufacturers is  
     $60.00

     $150.00 p.a 
      (Part 2.8 of Report by Mr Collett 9.10.06 vol 2, tab 31 pages 638, 639 and Part 2.1 of Report by Mr Collett 11.2.07 vol 2, tab 32 page 674 
     ). 
      
       
      
     19. The Pine Trees will take 10 years to grow sufficiently to operate as an adequate wind break (for fully matured apple trees). The replacement pine trees were planted in or about July 2003 
      (Affidavit Mr Hawke 19.7.06 vol 2, tab tab 23, para 13 page 464) 
     . 
      
      
     20. The semi dwarf yearling root stock for both gala and granny smith apple trees will take approximately 8 – 10 years to achieve optimal fruit production. 
      
      
     21. The yearling semi dwarf rootstock apple trees can be planted and treated within approximately 6 – 7 years after new or replacement pine trees have been planted 
      (Part 2.8 of Report by Mr Collett 9.10.06 vol 2, tab 31 page 639

     24. On the assumption that the defendant is only liable for the losses in relation to the destruction of the 28 gala apple trees and the damage to 55 gala apple trees and the destruction of the 8 granny smith apple trees ad the damage to 8 granny smith apple trees the first plaintiff’s loss and damage is as follows:

      h. Costs 
      
    91. Having set out the plaintiff’s schedule, I now make the following general comments about the category 1 and category 2 damages: 
     
     Category 1 damages 
     
     
     (a) The burnt apple trees had not been replaced but cut down. The defendant submits that the cost of replacement cannot be recovered. This is not correct because if they had not been replaced now, they would be in the future. Accordingly, it becomes a question of whether the appropriate cost is $20 per tree or $7.50 or $7.70; whether the trees have been replaced yet or not, as the unchallenged evidence is that this was an apple tree orchard which the plaintiff, but for the fire, would have continued to operate. 
     
     
     (b) There is a dispute on the sales and costs prices. This is based on information provided to the expert by Mr Tim Hall. It is asserted that there is little if any documentation to support the plaintiff's contention, but in fact the cost of apples, and in particular gala apples, is the subject of prior sales and is relatively straightforward. 
     
     
     Category 2 
     
     
     (a) The plaintiff submits, and I accept, that there is no real disagreement between the experts as to the appropriate methodology (see T-459.5-.55). The real focus is on prices, yields, pack out rates and sales price and costs per case with the plaintiff's expert (Mr Collette) relying on actual figures provided by Tim Hall, while the defendant's expert relies on industry averages as opposed to specific sales from Bonny Glen (T-459-460). 
     
     
     (b) In addition, there is now no issue between the experts except that the pack out rates and sales prices and costs were at the top of the range and that the costs incurred by Bonny Glen were towards the lower end of the range, although not out of the range. 
     
     
     (c) It was the unchallenged evidence of members of the Hall family that this was the ""star"" field which produced the best apples in the orchard. 
     
     
     (d) Although an enormous amount of time was spent on the erection of a temporary windbreak or artificial structure, I accept the submissions of the plaintiff that this is a false issue. The unchallenged evidence of Mr Reg Kidd was that he had travelled most of the world looking at apple growing areas, including apple growing areas through Australia, and he had never seen an artificial windbreak anywhere, including on a research station (T-230). 
     
     
      In addition, there was unchallenged evidence that a development application would be necessary for such a windbreak to be constructed, and there was unchallenged evidence by a member of the local council that such a construction was unlikely to be granted a development application in these days of environmental awareness. 
     
     
     (e) Finally, and most conclusively, there is no evidence that Mr Hawke, upon whose property this windbreak would need to be built, would ever consent to the construction of such an eyesore on his property. Mr Hawke's affidavit makes it clear that the beauty of the pines was a significant plus for him, particularly since he wants to sell his two 5 acre blocks to persons who want to have hobby farms or otherwise live in a country on a large block. Finally, it was never made clear to me whether the building of this structure was even possible, given that there is a range of pines that has been growing on the spot since 2003. Accordingly, I have had no regard to the evidence concerning the construction of an artificial structure as a windbreak either on the subject of contributory negligence or failure to mitigate, or as a sensible alternative to the growing of new trees in the site of the trees destroyed by the fire. Senior counsel for the plaintiff draws to my attention the failure of the defendant to produce any evidence describing what the particular structure would look like, or to provide a plan or explain how it was to be built or the precise materials to be used. In those circumstances, the failure to replace the damaged or destroyed trees until the new pine trees have produced an adequate windbreak needs to be looked at in the light of the unchallenged evidence that it will take approximately 10 years from July 2006 before the replacement pine trees will reach the height and density required to produce a sufficient buffer. 
    Category Two damages92. I propose to deal with the problems in the category two claim for damages first, as many of the disputed issues concerning quantum and costing were canvassed during the evidence on this issue, and it is easier to consider the respective arguments on this issue first.93. The real issue is, in my view, whether the plaintiff can first make out the factual basis upon which it is asserted that it was necessary for the trees to be destroyed. Mr Hawke’s attitude to the spraying94. The evidence of Mr Hawke about his attitude to the spraying is crucial, because the plaintiff's contention essentially is that the trees had to be cut down because of spray drift coming from their property onto Parkwood could lead to the plaintiff being the subject of complaints or prosecution. Without the windbreak to absorb the poisons used to spray on apples, it was the evidence of the plaintiff's witnesses that the informal relationship and friendship between the owners of Bonny Glen and Parkwood, which had continued when Mr Hawke decided to cease operating orchard operations on Parkwood and graze cattle instead, would be no barrier to complaint or prosecution. 95. The history of this relationship, and the circumstances in which some changes were made to the row of pine trees, is as follows. The orchard had the benefit of the pine tree windbreak from 1973 to 1988. In about 1988 some of these trees were removed to make way for a bigger shed. That shed was, however, never actually extended as planned and there was a gap between Parkwood and Bonny Glen as a result. This gap did not concern Mr Hawke because at the time those properties were being operated as orchards so they were spraying the same sort of chemicals. After Mr Hawke decided to graze cattle instead, in 2001, he came to an alternative arrangement with the Hall family so that he could graze his top and bottom paddocks during the spraying season and only graze them opposite the portion of the property without a windbreak during Winter while Fred Hall was not spraying. This arrangement was put in place and operated thereafter. However, following the fire there was a much larger gap. Following this event, Mr Hawke's affidavit of 27 March 2007 states: 
     
     ""10. Following the fire on 10 November 2002 to which I have deposed in my previous Affidavits, there is now also a much larger gap in the pine trees or about 150 metres at the northern most part of the common boundary between Bonny Glen and Parkwood (""the Destroyed Windbreak""). According to the arrangement I have with Mr Hall, the area immediately to the east of the Destroyed Windbreak is part of the land upon which I graze my cattle during Bonny Glen's summer spraying season, the balance being to the south of the Removed Pine Trees. 
     
     
     11. After clearing the orchard on Parkwood after 2001, although I do not now recall how, I do recall that I had been told that the Orange City Council (""the Council"") might soon stop approving subdivisions of land in the Orange District. 
     
     
     12. At about this time, so as not to miss out on my opportunity to subdivide the land on Parkwood in case I ever decided to sell part of the land for residential development, I had Parkwood surveyed and submitted a development application to the Council. There were two (2) subdivisions, one for the land on which my house is built, and the [sic] for a five acre block next to Destroyed Windbreak and a residual block. 
     
     
     13. Annexed and marked "" 
     A 
     "" is a copy of the development approval dated 16 July 1998. 
     
     
     14. Annexed and marked "" 
     B 
     "" is a copy of a Subdivision Certificate for the land to which Annexure A refers dated 23 May 2002. 
     
     
     15. At about the time of the fire in late 2002, I recall that the issue of spray drift had become a widely discussed topic and I attended at several community meetings on the subject with other orchardists in the Orange district, during which, I learned that the Environmental Protection Authority was going to start imposing severe penalties upon orchardists if their business practices caused pesticide sprays drifting unto other properties. 
     
     
     16. After the fire and the loss of the windbreak in November 2002, I became concerned about spray drift from Bonny Glen in light of the Development Approval, so I had a conversation with Mr Timothy Hall, during which i said to him words to the following effect: 
     
     
      
       
       Me: "" 
       Tim, spray drift is a real issue now as you know. You won't be able to spray that block since I got that DA. I think you'd better tell Fred to stop spraying that block until the new pines re-grow. 
       "" 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       Tim Hall: "" 
       Yes, I know - I'm worried about it too. I'll talk to dad about it. 
       "" 
       
      
     
     
     17. As well as for the reasons that I have given in my previous Affidavits, it is also because I am concerned about spray drift that I immediately replanted replacement pine trees to replace the Destroyed Windbreak. 
     
     
     18. I plan to continue using Parkwood as a farming property for the moment. In light of mine and my father's arrangement with Mr Hall not to graze my cattle on the Parkwood adjacent to the Removed Pine Trees, I cannot also agree not to graze my stock on the land next to the Destroyed Windbreak during Bonny Glen's spraying season because I will have almost not [sic] land left on Parkwood to use for farming purposes. 
     
     
     19. If, however, I choose to sell the subdivided land next to the Destroyed Windbreak then, for environmental reasons, I believe that Bonny Glen will not be able to spray its north-eastern block until the pine trees grow to an effective windbreak."" 
    96. Paragraph 19 was read only on the basis of Mr Hawke's personal belief.97. Attached to this affidavit is a list of conditions for the subdivision of the block. There is a reference to the existing pine trees, but only on the basis that these pine trees are to be pruned to be 3 metres clear of the proposed access road (see paragraphs 13 and 14). It was not a condition of the development application that the pine trees remain in place, merely that they be pruned.98. The evidence of the Hall family was that if they were to spray the trees in question, they had received advice from Mr Kidd and others that they could be prosecuted because the poisonous spray could carry not only across Parkwood but even further. There was talk of it going as far as the local hospital. It was asserted that it was open to Mr Hawke to make a complaint to the relevant authorities which might lead to prosecution of members of the Hall family.99. The following questions were asked of Mr Hawke in cross-examination: 
     
     ""Q. Do you not have any concerns about spray drift coming 
      
     through those deciduous trees to your place? 
      
     A. Well, look, to be perfectly frank I'm fourth generation in the industry, my house was exposed when we were growing fruit trees to the same sorts of conditions, probably in - to a greater degree than what I'm exposed to now and I've never had any objections as far as it coming onto my house itself, but I certainly take precautions, I don't use rain water I use bore water for the drinking water. ... 
     
     
     Q. In respect of your wife's children, do you have a concern about spray coming through those deciduous trees into the house? 
      
     A. No. 
     
     
     Q. So as far as you're concerned, Mr Hall, ... it is perfectly acceptable to live some matter of metres from an area where there may be spraying going on and there isn't a total buffer? 
      
     A. No... it would be one thing that wouldn't concern me because our house is virtually fully protected right through the spraying season... 
     
     
     Q. Did you ever tell or say to Mr Hall, Fred, Tim or Bernard, that he should not or must not spray any part of his apple orchard? Did you ever say that to them or one of them? 
      
     A. No, I voiced my concerns when we didn't have that windbreak there and I voiced my concerns of the consequences of spray contamination with cattle because that's obviously of concern to everyone. 
     
     
     Q. Did you ever say to them other than about the cattle... 
      
     A. I certainly voiced my concern in strong terms, yes. 
     
     
     Q. You said you were concerned about it. Did you ever say ""I do not want you to spray in that field""? 
      
     A. Certainly while I've got cattle and I want to be notified if you are spraying, if you are doing any spraying. 
     
     
     Q. So you [sic] concern was, if you are going to spray, let me know because I don't want my cattle getting mixed up with your spray? 
      
     A. That's correct."" (T-247-250) 
    100. It was the evidence of the plaintiff's witnesses that spraying could not occur because Mr Hawke would not allow it (T-111). However, that is not the effect of Mr Hawke's evidence. All Mr Hawke wants is to be told when they are spraying so that he could move his cattle. He did not, in the witness box, come up to proof of the words in paragraph 16 of his affidavit.101. The plaintiff further claimed that Mr Hawke wanted there to be no spraying because the 5 acre blocks had been decontaminated (T-111) and Mr Hawke gave evidence that he did not want to have to decontaminate again. However, Mr Hawke in fact lives in one of the subdivided blocks (T-243) the southern gap is as close to at least one of the blocks as the northern gap.102. Secondly, the existence of the southern gap, although partially explained in a historical sense by Mr Hawke's affidavit, must fundamentally destroy the perception argument in relation to spray drift and objections by Mr Hawke as well as to claims that the spray could go as far as the new hospital (according to the evidence, apples have continued to be grown (and sprayed) on this block since 2001). Mr Tim Hall had to concede (T-323) that there was no difference between spray coming through either gap. His response was to say that if this was the case, he would have to get rid of apples in the south field as well.103. Furthermore, the pine trees were on Parkwood and while Mr Hawke said he had no intention of removing trees, and this is something I am prepared to accept as unlikely, given his strong feelings about the attractiveness of the trees, the fact remains that if Mr Hawke and his family sold Parkwood tomorrow and the new owner wished to remove them, there would be nothing that the plaintiff could do. Part of the evidence was that, unlike the Hall family, where the sons were carrying on the business, Mr Hawke's family was unlikely to do so.104. Accordingly, the factual basis for asserting it was necessary to remove the apple trees because of spray drift and objections by Mr Hawke cannot be made out. In addition, evidence from the experts about the dangers of spray drift from the northern apple orchard is a danger, but spray drift from the southern apple orchards is not, would be an inconsistency which I find impossible to reconcile.105. I have noted these factual findings because, in my view, there is a break in the chain of causation. I find that the removal of the fruit trees was not as a result of any request from Mr Hawke. It was done on a recommendation by Mr Collette and Mr Kidd. However, if their advice is not foreseeable, or wrongly overcautious, or based on incorrect information (eg the belief Mr Hawke might report the Hall family for prosecution), or just simply wrong, it does not entitle the plaintiff to claim that this is damage flowing from the fire.106. There are other evidentiary difficulties that stand in the way of the plaintiff’s claim for damages for the total replacement of the apple trees in the field and the consequential economic loss. Many other orchards in the Orange district, and for that matter in other locations, do not have windbreaks. The presence or absence of a windbreak, while an advantage to an orchard, is not an essential pre-requisite to a successful apple orchard.107. It was the evidence of Mr Fred Hall (T-57-59) that he received advice from Mr Kidd and Mr Collette but did not consult a lawyer because “what would he know about fruit trees?” (T-57.40). His concern was that he would “run foul” (T-57) of his neighbour and that his neighbour would “complain to law” (T-57.51-.52). Mr Fred Hall agreed he was aware that there were many orchards operating where there were no windbreaks and said “they’re taking the risk” (T-57.9). Mr Hall agreed that he still sprayed on the southern block: “Q. Do you still spray on it? A. Yes. 
     
     Q. There’s nothing to stop spray drift going out of that orchard, is there? 
     A. That’s right. Q. What’s the difference? 
     
     A. Well down the front there’s two five acre lots and there’s an easement up there for a road for the two five acres and the house of David’s next door and he has objected to that because his children go to school up that road and his wife. And when he sells those blocks of ground – we’ve had meetings in the area by a regional developer of all [sic] – because this is coming up to be a big thing, and they say if you want to subdivide you must have a barrier. 
      
      
     Q. Is the problem that’s coming along I [sic] that area that oranges grow residentially and encroaching on you and your fellow orchardist? 
      
     A. Stopping farming and it’s quite a big thing in the district. 
      
      
     Q. So in reality, Mr Hall, your block alongside the burnt trees has always been at risk? 
      
     A. No, because the pines were there. 
      
      
     Q. That’s assuming they were fully effected [sic]? 
      
     A. Yes. 
      
      
     Q. Are you aware of any of the orange orchardists that have actually been taking down- 
      
     A. Yeah, had to push their orchard out, yeah… 
      
      
     Q. That had actually taken down windbreaks but yet carried on running orchard [sic]? 
      
     A. Yeah.” (T-57-58) 
    108. Mr Hall agreed that the spray in the paddock just south of the shed was capable of going out the fifty metre gap all over Parkwood (T-71).109. I should pause to note that I accept the submission of the defendant that since Mr Hawke said he lived on one of the subdivided blocks (T-243) the markings of the subdivision on page 147A (which is in volume 1 of Exhibit O) are clearly wrong.110. Essentially, what Mr Fred Hall was saying was that he took the advice of Mr Collette and Mr Kidd that the risk of spraying on the affected field was too great so that the apple trees should be removed. Neither of these experts was asked to comment on spraying generally at Bonny Glen and if their reports had looked at this issue it would have shown the difficulties of giving such advice when there was in fact spraying on the southern field. I can see no reason to distinguish the difference between spraying in the field opposite the gap south of the shed and spraying in the field next to the burnt down pines. I note that the gap between these fields is 169 metres.111. In addition to Mr Hawke’s evidence falling short of the conversations set out in his own affidavit and also referred to in the evidence of Mr Fred Hall and his sons, there is the difficulty of explaining how it is that the spray drift should not come across in the top field when it comes across through the southern field, especially in circumstances where there were errors in describing where the two five acre blocks and Mr Hawke’s home was.112. A third area of factual difficulty is that the evidence of both experts, and in particular Mr Kidd, concerning the distance that spray drift will travel and the willingness of public authorities to prosecute if it reaches the local hospital (one and a half kilometres away) is very difficult to accept. The experts retreated to make much of the issue of what was called “perception”. In other words, in this time of environmental awareness, it was not so much that spray drift was a difficulty, but there was a perception that the spraying of poisonous chemicals could be an environmental or health hazard. However, Mr Collette said he would safely place a hospital 100-200 metres east of Bonny Glen (T-169.59). Mr Collette said at T-172 that he was concerned about spray drift coming out from the bottom gap as well (T-172.21). He then retreated from this position and said that the spray would not travel in that direction (T-172-173).113. Mr Trevor Hall gave evidence that one of his neighbours, a Mr Dino Cunial, had trouble with spray drift going onto the road from where he was spraying 40 metres away (T-269). He was certain that the spray could reach as far as the new hospital one and a half kilometres away and could even go further (T-272), perhaps as far as seven kilometres. When asked if he was concerned that the spray drift from the southern apple orchard could travel the sixty metres to Mr Hawke’s house, he responded firstly that this orchard had been taken out three years beforehand (T-274) but when shown the map, which indicated that Mr Hawke’s house was about 130-140 metres from the gap, said that there was no concern about spray drift going from the southern gap across to the 130 or 140 metres to Mr Hawke’s home. The following exchange occurred at T-275: 
     
     “Q. So it’s not so much a matter of safety, it’s a matter of concern, is it? 
      
     A. Well, it’s a matter of safety. I can control that spray drift. He’s got his house bound, as you can see, by trees and sheds so he’s got buffers already there around his house. No, I don’t see it as a problem. 
      
      
     Q. But you do see as a problem the hospital one and a half kilometres away, is that correct? 
      
     A. As one of the problems, that’s only one. 
      
      
     Q. So why is that we’ve got no problem with the house 140 metres away but we've got a problem with a hospital or some other building one and a half kilometres away? 
      
     A. I’ve got a problem between my neighbour [sic]… 
      
      
     Q. So the question of a problem is one of neighbourly relations rather than any possible danger caused by spray, is that correct? 
      
     A. No. 
      
      
     Q. Do you have a safety concern in relation to the new hospital? 
      
     A. Yes I do. 
      
      
     Q. What I’m asking you sir is simply this. If you’ve got a safety concern about a hospital which is one and a half kilometres away how can you not have a safety concern about a residence with a man, a wife and two children in it which is 140 metres away? 
      
     A. I do. I have a concern for everybody there. I have a concern with people buying the other block, yes I do. 
      
      
     Q. What have you done to allay your concern? 
      
     A. We’ve pushed out, after much deliberation we’ve pushed out that block. 
      
      
     Q. Sorry, which block? 
      
     A. The block that’s had the buffer zone taken away, burnt. 
      
      
     Q. Yes, but you haven’t done anything about the block down at the bottom, 140 metres from Mr Hawke’s house? 
      
     A. Mr Hawke has got a buffer zone around his house. 
      
      
     Q. Between the hospital and your property, what’s the topography like? 
      
     A. Rolling paddocks and there’s some- 
      
      
     Q. Are there any trees? 
      
     A. A few trees…” (T-275-276) 
    114. Mr Collette’s evidence was different again. He agreed (T-163) that there was absolutely no buffer there, although he claimed that the buffer would be “low grass” (T-163.32-.33).115. Mr Kidd is an expert in spray drift (T – 204). He agreed (T – 208) that in the Orange area there were a number of orchards that did not have buffers but that there was “a higher risk now and they are decreasing in acreage and size”. When asked if this was because of the increase in environmental protection he replied that this was a “little bit of both” because “it’s got a lot to do with perception also”. There was the urban/rural interface, there were different expectations and there was a perceived risk all over the state in relation to farm practices such as spraying. Consequently “a whole range of factors” would determine what sort of crops to grow and a “whole host of variables” would determine the risk (T – 208, lines 15 – 26).116. He was asked whether he would advise a hypothetical apple orchard purchaser to buy Bonny Glen, because on these criteria, he would have to advise such a person not to go ahead. His reply was, however, not “no”, but that he would take the purchaser through the risks, which included spray application, public perception, being close to town, people breaking into the orchard and stealing fruit and trespassing. The closeness of the orchard to town and to other public facilities gave rise to “a whole range of risks” (T 208 lines 36 – 44).117. Did these risks outweigh the benefits? If the price was right, Mr Kidd would say “go ahead and do it” because this is possible for vineyards. As to his advice to Mr Hall, he said “My advice …was I reckoned the risk was too high because of the things that were happening in that area with the encroachment of the dams, etcetera and so forth, where they were. Now, that’s the advice. The decision then always comes back to the person who owns the business (T 209 lines 3 – 8).118. A significant reason for giving that advice was the closeness of the hospital. However, like Mr Collette, he was not able to explain why it was that the escaping of spray from the northern field was dangerous to the hospital 1.5 kilometres away when spray from the southern field was apparently not even a danger to the property next door (T - 212 – 213). His answer appeared to be that it was “more visible” (T – 213 line 35). The following exchange occurred at T – 214: 
     
     ""Q. You’re suggesting are you, that over a distance of 1 and a half or so kilometers it makes a difference whether the spray is coming out of the one gap or the other? 
      
     A. No, the perception, or seeing, yes. The perception of seeing, yes."" 
    119. It soon transpired that Mr Kidd had not measured these respective gaps (T – 215 – 216) and he then suggested that different apples might make a difference (T – 216 lines 30 – 55).120. Mr Kidd was also not able to explain why it was that if buffers were essential for good spraying management there was no reference to them in spraying manuals (T – 219 – 220), although he proffered the opinion that these guides were mainly for pilots who sprayed. However, these manuals talked about the need to inform neighbours that you were spraying, and clearly if there were buffers to prevent spray drift this would impact on the mandatory need to warn. By T – 220 he was retreating into generalizations such as looking at the variables, including who are the neighbours and where are the water supplies.121. At T – 225 Mr Kidd was asked whether, absent reckless or willful disregard, the EPA would in fact prosecute anyone for spray drift. He expressed the view that the EPA would do so. This is inconsistent with a statement in his report (T – 225) and he retreated behind the statement that he did not have a legal background (T – 226). 122. At T – 227 Mr Kidd was asked if a vegetative strip, as opposed to a row of pine trees, would be a sufficient buffer. This statement was contained in a government brochure which Mr Kidd agreed was aimed at farms that did not have a tree buffer (T – 227).123. As an expert on spray drift, it was Mr Kidd’s opinion that was the crucial report relied upon by the plaintiff in relation to the removal of the remaining apple trees in the field. The above summary of his evidence shows how far Mr Kidd retreated from his position. His explanation of why spray drift from the field affected by the fire was so dangerous while spray drift from the south field (where there is no buffer) was not is incomprehensible. Ultimately, what seems to have been the reason for removal of the trees was a cocktail of concerns which included such disparate matters as the dangers of theft and trespass with the increasing urbanization of the area. There is nothing in Mr Kidd’s evidence to support the contention that it was reasonably foreseeable that as a result of the fire all of the trees in this field would have to be removed. Legal issues relating to the second category damages124. In addition to these factual problems, I must determine whether the claim of pure economic loss is capable of being causally related to the property damage suffered by the plaintiff.  125. Senior counsel for the defendant draws my attention to the article ""Liability for pure economic loss: yes, but why"" in Volume 28 (1999) University of Western Australia Law Review 84, which was referred to with approval by McHugh J in Perre v Apand Pty Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 180 at 218. The defendant submits that, even if the facts favoured the plaintiff's claim that the field had to be cut down because of spray drift, the claim would differ in material respects from those where courts have awarded damages for pure economic loss and the facts do not fall into any of the categories identified by Professor Feldthusen in the article referred to in paragraph 20(b) above. Category 2 damages here are not ""Relational Economic Loss"", as defined, given the absence of any contractual or other legal relationship between Bonny Glen and Parkwood. Furthermore, Bonny Glen and Parkwood are not in the equivalent positions of the plaintiffs in Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge Willemstad (1976) 136 CLR 529 given the absence of any contractual relationship or legal entitlement on the part of Bonny Glen to the benefit of the trees on Parkwood (see also Hawkins v Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539 at 594 and 601 per Gaudron J). The defendant in the instant case, unlike the defendant in Perre v Apand, had no actual knowledge that its negligent conduct would lead to the damage of the loss of the entire field as a consequence. In Perre, the defendant had actual knowledge of the very risk that materialised and this was an important consideration - see Gleeson CJ at 194/5. Finally, the defendant submits that there was a breach in the chain of causation by the plaintiff’s decision in 2005 to remove all of the trees.126. The plaintiff submits that a person in the position of Country Energy may owe a duty to take reasonable care not to cause purely economic loss by his or her negligent acts or omissions and both parties agreed that the following factors were identified in Perre v Apand (1999) 198 CLR 180 as being relevant: 
     
     (a) reasonable foreseeability is a necessary, though not sufficient condition relating to duty of care; 
      
       
      
     (b) the defendant should have actual knowledge of the risk of the plaintiff, although constructive knowledge may sometimes be sufficient (and in this regard there is reliance on Mr Middleton’s acknowledgment of the purpose of the trees as a buffer); 
      
      
     (c) liability must not be indeterminate but must be able to be reasonably calculated and the defendant must know or have the means to know who are the members of the ascertainable class affected by his conduct; 
      
      
     (d) the plaintiff’s vulnerability to risk is relevant, and this is particularly of importance in relation to an electricity supply. 
    127. The plaintiff draws my attention to the statement of Brennan CJ in Hill v Van Erp (1997) 188 CLR 159 at 168-169: 
     
     “The objection that no claim for economic loss lies in negligence unless it is in respect of damages to the existing right or interests is, in my opinion, erroneous … A benefit that the plaintiff would have received but for the negligence of the defendant is a loss, for which damage may be recovered, whether or not the benefit would have been gratuitous.” 
    128. This principle applies in both tort and contract and, accordingly, it is submitted that when the defendant foresaw or contemplated loss as a general character of the loss in question, the plaintiff will recover damages, even if the defendant did not foresee or contemplate the precise manner in which the loss in question occurred.129. While I do not have a problem with this statement of the law, to argue that it was not merely reasonably foreseeable but inevitable that if Country Energy did not prune the trees a fire may occur (which I do accept), this does not mean that the removal of other fruit trees by Bonny Glen is reasonable or foreseeable. The plaintiff submits it is not necessary to show that the precise manner in which its loss or damage was sustained was reasonably foreseeable; it is sufficient that some loss or damage of the same general character is sufficient.130. In Pyrenees Shire Council v Day (1998) 192 CLR 330 the High Court carefully explained the circumstances in which the doctrine of general reliance applied in limited situations. It is clear, especially when one has regard to the statements of McHugh J at 370, that the facts in the present case clearly fall within those limited situations, as this is a classic example where an authority provides services which have supplanted private responsibility, such as fire control or controlling air traffic. It is also fair to say that the public authority must know or ought to know, to use the words of McHugh J at 371 that the plaintiff’s property would suffer damage unless care was taken. However, there was no challenge to findings of fact that the losses that were claimed flowed from the conduct of the council in failing to take steps to ensure that a deficient fireplace and chimney in an adjoining building were repaired (see Kirby J at 406). This appears to have remained unchallenged despite some strong hints from the bench, reading between the lines of Kirby J at 406. Consequently, the principles discussed by the High Court in Pyrenees Shire Council do not relate to the kind of loss under present consideration. As McHugh J goes on to note, whether or not the loss in question is able to be claimed will depend upon the facts in each case.131. Accordingly I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has made out that the category 2 loss flowed from the negligent acts or from the breach of contract by the defendant.Category 2 damages – quantum issues132. This brings me to the challenge to the method of calculation of the loss. It is appropriate that I should determine the quantum of this loss even though I have found that it does not flow from the negligent act or the breach of contractual obligations of the defendant, in the event that there are disputed issues for consideration on appeal. 133. The defendant complains that the only documentation relied upon is the profit and loss statements and a selection of invoices. However, there is sufficient information available from the profit and loss statements and invoices provided. It ought not to be necessary for a business to produce every invoice, or even most of its invoices, as well as to call its bookkeeper in order to establish what its general trading position was. This was a substantial apple orchard which had been running for over thirty years.134. The first issue is the loss of yields. These figures are not in contention as far as I understand the evidence. Nor is the identity of the market in dispute, namely the wholesale market for the sale of fully matured premium quality apples, which is the market for which most of the apples in this particular part of the orchard were destined, and the manufacturer’s market for apples of inferior quality which are made into juices, pies, dried fruits and the like. The reason for the high quality of the apples in this orchard was because of the existence of the buffer, which meant that what is called “branch rub” is at a minimum. As a result the fruit was rarely bruised and was in premium condition. Nor was there any challenge to the yield from the trees. The real questions boil down to the amounts for which the Gala and Granny Smith apples could be sold per case and the costs which were incurred.135. The plaintiff has met each of these issues by providing a selection of invoices for prices for cases of apples and also for costs. I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence in relation to the sale prices for Gala apples, and in particular the red Gala apples which were grown in his orchard and which are at the top of the market. In contrast, the defendant’s evidence consisted essentially of referring to general prices for apples and general costs.136. Finally, there is the question of how long it will take the pine trees to grow. Again, this was not the subject of dispute in the course of the trial.137. Accordingly, while I reject the portion of the claim which relates to category two damages of $753,396.72 total economic loss, I should indicate if I have erred in this regard, it is my view that the plaintiff has established through the production of sufficient invoices concerning actual sales prices and costs that if the apple orchard had been able to continue the quantum of the loss is as claimed by the plaintiff.138. I note that the amount claimed is in excess of the jurisdictional limit. Senior counsel for the plaintiff indicated that any excess would be waived. Accordingly, if I have erred in holding that the plaintiff is not entitled to category 2 damages, judgment for the plaintiff should be entered in the sum of $750,000.00Category one damages139. This is a comparatively straightforward matter. The plaintiff has provided a number of receipts and invoices concerning yield, pack out and price. There is no dispute that the 28 Gala apple trees and 8 Granny Smith apple trees that were destroyed and the 55 Gala apple trees and 8 Granny Smith trees were damaged as a result of the fire. The dispute in this regard is essentially limited to past and future economic loss and calculation methods. However, I accept the figures put forward by the plaintiff for the following reasons.140. The defendant complains at paragraph 45 of the written submissions that there is insufficient documentation in relation to economic loss. In particular, there were no sales documents for selling any Gala apples over the 18 months before the fire. Mr Hall said that there must be further invoices “because we do sell [sic] every year”. Given that the orchard sells Granny Smith and Gala apples in large quantities, this clearly must be the case. The yield for the trees in question makes it clear that these must have been sold. The most likely explanation is that these documents were given to Mr Collette. Whatever the explanation, Mr Collette was able to give evidence and be cross-examined about these costs as well as to review the documentary information he had in his report.141. Mr Gordon in his evidence for the defendant made a number of concessions about apple prices. He conceded that apple prices were very high in 2006 and 2007 (T-500) and he conceded it was possible for another co-operative to obtain $42 for twelve kilogram three layer cases of Gala apples (T-500), although he said that this was a “spot market”. Nor was he surprised to hear that others had obtained similarly high prices. He said “You might get the $36 or $32 or even higher than that in the top two size ranges, but I argue they won’t be across the board and won’t average that across the board…” (T-501). He was not surprised to hear that Bonny Glen had been selling twelve kilogram cases of Gala apples for $34.80 (T-501). Essentially what he was saying was that the plaintiff’s claim was at the top end of the range: 
     
     “Q. You’re just saying top end of the range? 
      
     A. That’s correct.” 
    142. In other words, he was not saying it was impossible, just at the top of the range. Yet the evidence was that this was the top field in what was clearly a very successful orchard. As for the costs, Mr Gordon thought that some of the costs set out by the plaintiff were in fact too low (T-502). He agreed it was necessary to know all of the details of the business structure that Bonny Glen was operating on to express an adequate view, and while he was not prepared to assume that they would get the yields and pack out rates that had been assumed by Mr Collette, he had to concede that he had not had the benefit of looking at the details of Bonny Glen’s business structure. He conceded that if this was the premier lot in the Bonny Glen orchard, that might explain why some of these numbers were higher than he would otherwise expect (T-503.25).143. In other words, there were substantial concessions from Mr Gordon which materially assisted the plaintiff’s case, and in those circumstances the complaints of the defendant about alleged inadequate documentation must mean very little.144. I have not dealt with the other items in the list, such as the removal of the dead trees. The quantum for these items is not in dispute. The essential difference between the category one damages as estimated by the plaintiff ($59,785.65) and the defendant ($18,918) relates to the past and future economic loss claims consequent upon the removal of the trees that were destroyed, plus an allowance for the trees that were damaged.145. Accordingly, I accept the plaintiff’s quantification of the category one damages and will award the plaintiff $59,785.65.146. I was not addressed on the availability or otherwise of interest in relation to damages in the event of my finding that there was a breach of contract between the plaintiff and defendant as well as a breach of duty of care.147. I have granted a liberty to apply, which the parties may exercise in relation to any outstanding matters, such as any application for indemnity costs.Orders(1) Judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $59,785.65.(2) Defendant pay plaintiff’s costs.(3) Exhibits retained for 28 days.(4) Liberty to apply.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Kevin David Johnson presents as a case of history repeating itself. I suspect that Mr Johnson is the only one present in court who is having difficulty seeing that fact.2 Three years after his father died, his mother took up with a new partner. That was 20 years ago, when he was six years old. The new partner flogged his mother in brutal episodes of domestic violence. She sustained broken ribs and broken bones in her hand as a consequence of this man's cruelty and brutality. Listening to him give evidence no one could doubt his sense of anger and grievance at this man because of the wrong way the monster treated his mother.3 At some point the violence towards his mother resulted in him, that is Kevin Johnson, being sent away. He had done nothing wrong, yet he and his mother were the ones who paid the price for this man's violence.4 He told me he is still angry about being sent away from his mother. She sent him to his grandmother where he now lives (when he is not in gaol) with his eight year old sister.5 He, now, is acting out. Sending him away may have given the wrong message, because to a young boy he saw a violent man win, while he lost. He saw the wrong person sent packing from the mother's house.6 Domestic violence usually has at least four ingredients: Alcohol; anger; an inability to communicate feelings to a person of importance, and uncontrollable frustration at that inability. It is the uncontrollable frustration that usually is the display of violence.7 In the 20 years that have passed, Kevin Johnson has been before the courts on many occasions for offences of domestic violence.8 His teacher, no doubt, was in part the violent man who belted his mother. Frankly he, Kevin Johnson, just does not get it. Today's women are less prepared to tolerate physical abuse. Fortunately, more and more victims are coming forward, understanding they too have a responsibility to fight domestic violence, and they can only do so by reporting it to hospitals, social welfare workers, the police and vacating premises where domestic violence is occurring.9 This appellant appeals against the severity of sentences imposed upon him as a consequence of a violent assault upon his partner of two months and his inappropriate responses to police investigating and seeking to arrest him.10 His criminal conduct on the night and morning of the 17/18 January put him in serious trouble. The facts of the offence are worth noting.11 His evidence before me is that he was drinking that morning with four of his mates. They consumed two cartons each containing 30 cans of beer among themselves. His estimate is that he consumed 30 of those cans. There was also a cask of moselle or casks of moselle present as well.12 During the afternoon of 17 January, 2007, Sheena Dutton was visiting him at his house in Woore Street Wilcannia. An argument occurred and she left Woore street to attend the Mission in Wilcannia to socialise with friends. He continued on drinking. About midnight on 18 January Ms Dutton was at Warreli Avenue in the Mission. The appellant was dropped off in a motor vehicle and that vehicle left.13 One can only infer from the fact that he does not live in the Mission and the vehicle left that his sole reason for being there was in pursuit of Ms Dutton. He approached her. There was a short conversation. During that conversation she was heard to say ""No! No! No! I don't want you"". She began to run in an attempt to get away from him. She ran around a truck parked on the street and was chased by him. He was becoming extremely aggressive. She ran into the front yard of a home to escape him.14 It was at this time that she was punched and forced to the ground. She was continually punched to her head and body. She was in pain and extremely frightened of the appellant. The punching, bruising and pain would be sufficient, on their own to constitute the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.16 During the assault he grabbed hold of her hair which was tied in a ponytail. He banged her head against the front wall of a house with substantial force a number of times. Again, that resulted in pain. He then armed himself with the frame of a chair striking her to the head and body. 16 What is to be noted about the three attacks is the focus upon the head. The skull to the head is very thin. Pulling it back and forth, if done severely enough, will cause brain damage. In other words, this victim was at risk of traumatic brain injury. That could have life long consequences. Boxers are people who often suffer traumatic brain injury simply because of the number of times that their head has been knocked back on its axis. There is no reason to think that women in the Aboriginal community are more resilient than boxers in a ring.17 The fight was of such a nature that witnesses and those about attempted to stop it. Someone took the chair and attempted to remove the appellant physically from the area. Meanwhile Ms Dutton ran away. The appellant gave chase. He caught up with her; pushed her into a side fence as she attempted to escape to her neighbour's house. Eventually she made it inside, where she sought refuge. 18 The police were called. When police arrived they saw her crying and holding her head in her hands. They noticed bruising, swelling and redness all over her face. She had blood coming from her nose. She was in pain. An assault of that ferocity is the very assault likely to cause serious injury.19 She was taken by police to the Wilcannia Police Station with a view that she would make a statement. As they were heading there, the police noted the appellant running down Reed Street, turning into Cleveland Street and then into Reed Lane. The police stopped the vehicle and sought to arrest him. He was told that he was under arrest and he was not to move. He immediately put his fists up in a fighting stance and yelled abuse: “Come on cunts touch me and I will kill you."" The appellant advanced towards Senior Constable Hall. Senior Constable Hall was a female. She responded with a burst of capsicum spray. He commenced throwing punches, yelling further abuse at her including: “Fuck you cunt."" Constable Wallace was seeking to assist. All the parties fell to the ground. My understanding is that Constable Wallace is also a female police officer. Only one male involved here.20 The appellant was on the ground kicking and tucking his arms under his chest to avoid being handcuffed. He was told on numerous occasions he was under arrest and to stop resisting. He failed to comply with any of those directions given to him. Those are the facts that constitute the resist arrest charge.21 Eventually he was handcuffed and placed in the rear of the police vehicle. As he was being taken to Wilcannia Police Station he yelled at Constable Hall - remember she is female:  
     
      
       
      “You fuckin dog cunts. I'll get out of here and me and my brothers will fuck you hard, cunts. You listening you big white cunt. I will find you. Ask anyone. I find people cunts, and you are on my list. You live at the Barracks in Waugh street. You're fucking mine to get.""  
      
    He was introduced by Senior Constable Hall to the Custody Manager. He said to her 
     
      
      “I will find you and kill you, you lesbian cock sucking cunts. When I get out of here I will cut your throat.” 
      
    Senior Constable Hall left the charge room and then Constable Jones, the Custody Manager, took over. He said:  
     
      
      “I'll wait until you're off duty and find out where you live. I'll stab you and I'll get my blokes to kill you""."" 
      
    22 As the police are required to do, they contacted the Aboriginal Legal Services and advised them that the appellant was in custody.23 So far as the threats made against Senior Constable Hall, she has indicated that she was intimidated by the graphic nature of the threats, insinuating as they did a potential sexual assault upon her and making reference to where she lived. She was concerned that the accused, who has strong community ties, was capable of carrying out the threats. His own home is a short distance from where she lived.24 Constable Jones also was intimidated by the threats of personal harm made against him and is concerned that others might be incited to carry out those threats.25 Mr Johnson says in his evidence that the threats were really the alcohol talking and he only intended that they should be expressions, as they were, of his anger and he had no intent of carrying them out. Of course, that intention was not conveyed to the victims, the Police Station, or generally. But at least it is now public.26 The appellant was before the Local Court on 24 May last, here in Broken Hill. He was sentenced for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm against his partner to two years imprisonment with an 18 month non-parole period to date from 18 January.27 In respect of his resisting police he was sentenced to three months. In respect of the two charges of intimidate police he was also sentenced to six months. All of those sentences were concurrent with the initial sentence.28 Indeed, the sentences for resist police and intimidate named Police Officers have now been served. Although the appeals were not formally abandoned, nothing was put to me to seek to do anything about those sentences and I do not intend to.29 Mr Kerkyasharian, who appears for the appellant, did however seek a reduction in the non-parole period, although he conceded that the two years imprisonment as the head sentence was an appropriate one. That concession, it appears to me, is well founded. 30 When I look at the appellant's record I can see in it that he was before the Children’s Court firstly in 1996 for offences demonstrating dishonesty, lack of respect for people's property and break enter and steal, malicious damage, attempt to steal motor vehicle, break and enter with intent, stealing from dwellings, larceny.31 His first offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm occurs whilst still a child in 1998. There are drunken offences such as: Use offensive language; intimidate police, bail -- refused to comply with direction. A second offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm occurs in 1999. Continuation of intimidating police. There is an offence of drive with medium range PCA among other offences in 2001. Again, behaving in an offensive manner near a public school and occasioning actual bodily harm, 1992 - on five occasions - maybe on only two occasions, it is difficult to tell. In respect of occasioning actual bodily harm in 2002 on three counts. There is a contravene domestic violence order in 2003 and two common assaults 2003. Another contravene domestic violence order in 2003. More common assaults 2003, 2004. A further assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2004 and another in 2005, and then these offences I am dealing with on appeal.32 The Probation and Parole report also paints a relatively bleak history and pain taking pictures of rehabilitation prospects. In terms of prior contact with Probation and Parole, the report notes that he has a poor history in relation to meeting his obligations. This is demonstrated, in November of 2002, where he appeared to need warrants to place him before the court in 2002; warrants in respect of community service order issued, also in 2002; breach of community service order in 2003; breach of s12 bond in 2003; convicted of offences whilst on bond in 2004. Although released in 2005 to attend alcohol and other drug counselling and anger management, it would appear that he breached parole for failure to report.33 His upbringing, again, demonstrates history repeating itself because he was surrounded in alcohol abuse and violence.34 He continues to reside with his grandmother and, as I said, his eight year old sister. He accepts some responsibility for looking after her. That is a matter that goes to his credit and ought to be acknowledged.35 He has had a number of children within the community to a number of different women in Broken Hill and Wilcannia. There is no report there of accepting any responsibility for them. This is, however, an observation of the history of physical abuse within those relationships and some of that may well be reflected in his criminal antecedents.36 There is concern about his attitude to this offence. Probation and Parole report that he has failed to take responsibility for his offending upon release, blaming the alcohol. He has minimized minimising his assault on his victim again in evidence, by blaming the alcohol, and saying he is only in trouble because she said she would never go through with the charges, and that he only knows how to resolve issues by saying: “I have only ever known to deal with things with my fists.” This reminds of me, of course, about the causes of domestic violence that I earlier referred to, and the immense frustration he must feel in not being able to communicate other than with his fists.37 The criminal law is a very blunt instrument for dealing with domestic violence. But I suppose when nothing else is about it will have to do. The question is whether Mr Johnson wants the use of the blunt instrument or is prepared to accept responsibility and do something about himself.38 I have said there are four causes to domestic violence. You have come onto base with the first, that is alcohol. There are three others that you must come to understand. I am going to give you the opportunity to do that. But if you do not you will be in breach of your parole and sent back to custody. 39 It is important that you have an opportunity to rehabilitate in the community. It is important that you be given a chance to try, yourself, to moderate your drinking, or better still to stop it all together if you can. It is important that you have an opportunity to live with a woman and enjoy it and have her enjoy it. It is important that you have an opportunity to have a family life, if you can. Those things can only be done in a community. They cannot be done behind the walls of a gaol.40 But if you abuse privileges which go with having a family; with having a relationship, then there is only one place for you. At the end of the day, it is important that you understand you must accept responsibility for the way in which you live and you must accept responsibility, as you have on this occasion, for failing; or for criminal conduct that comes about as a result of your failing. I know that you did because you pleaded guilty. So I know that you have accepted responsibility.41 What I propose to do is to uphold the appeal, to confirm the sentence of two years but to reduce the non-parole period to one of 12 months; to have you released at the conclusion of the non-parole period subject to your complying with Probation and Parole requirements including intensive supervision. For the first three months of your parole there will be a total ban on alcohol. Thereafter you may drink but any drinking that you do that gets you into trouble is your own fault. Do you understand all that? OFFENDER: Yes. HIS HONOUR: 42 The formal orders I make are these: The appeal is upheld; the conviction confirmed; the head sentence of two years confirmed but the non-parole period will be reduced to one of 12 months. It will date from 18 January 2007 and expire on 17 January 2008. Pursuant to s51 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I impose the following parole conditions: 1. That you will accept intensive supervision by Probation and Parole. 2. That for the first three months of your parole that is until 17 April 2008 you will abstain from alcohol and other drugs, save cigarettes. 3. You will submit to random testing for alcohol and drugs, any failure to submit for testing or any dirty testing in that three month period will be deemed a breach of parole and I urge the Parole Board to return you to custody. 4. Any failure to report to Probation and Parole thereafter and any failure to comply with other directions given by Probation and Parole, is to be deemed a breach of your parole and again I urge Probation and Parole to report the breach to the Parole Board.43 During now and then I would like you to consider those terms and see what you can make of it when you get out. Give it your best shot.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SANTOW JA: I agree with Howie J and the additional remarks of Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: It is, of course, disturbing to see a young man sentenced to such a substantial term of imprisonment. Nevertheless, these were very serious crimes, committed by an offender on conditional liberty and with a history of offences of a similar kind. I agree with the orders proposed by Howie J and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court in respect of seven charges to which the applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court. The applicant had been committed for sentence to the District Court where he adhered to his pleas of guilty and was ultimately sentenced on 15 December 2006. The charges for which the applicant was sentenced involved five offences of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon, contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act, one offence of possess loaded firearm so as to endanger life, contrary to s 93G(1)(a)(ii) of the Firearms Act and one offence of possess shortened firearm, contrary to s 62(1)(b) of that Act. In respect of the robbery offences the maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 25 years and in respect of each of the firearms offences, the maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was sentenced to an effective term of imprisonment of 13 years with an overall non-parole period of 10 years. The first of the sentences commenced on 6 December 2005 and the applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 5 December 2015. In respect of the first two charges of robbery the applicant was sentenced on each to a fixed term of three years imprisonment, the second sentence to be served cumulatively upon the first. In respect of the third, fourth and fifth charges of robbery the applicant was sentenced on each to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years with a balance of term of three years. Those sentences were concurrent within themselves but were to be served cumulatively upon the second count of robbery. On each of the firearm offences, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months each to be concurrent with the other and to be concurrent with the sentences for the third, fourth and fifth counts of robbery. 
     
      
    5 There are three grounds of appeal relied upon by the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. His Honour erred in not affording the applicant a full discount of 25 percent. 
         
         
        2. His Honour erred in imposing totally cumulative fixed terms in respect of each of the armed robbery offences. 
         
         
        3. The sentence failed to reflect his Honour’s finding of special circumstances. 
        
       
      
    6 The facts of the matters can be stated briefly. The applicant was released to parole in respect of a sentence for armed robbery on 30 June 2005. The first offence of armed robbery was committed on 20 July 2005 at a mixed business. The applicant walked in, picked up a punnet of fruit, waited for other customers to leave and then approached the counter area. He told the victim to give him money. He then unzipped his backpack and removed a sawn-off shotgun, opening the breach to show that it was fully loaded. The victim took money from the till and gave it to the applicant who asked him for money from his wallet and his watch. The victim told the applicant that he had no money and that the watch was an engagement present. The applicant then left the store taking about $350 in proceeds. The applicant was identified as the robber by reason of a fingerprint left by him on the punnet of fruit. 
     
      
    7 The second robbery occurred at a pharmacy on 10 August 2005. The applicant approached the counter and demanded that the victim opened the till. He unzipped his bag, showing a firearm handle protruding from it. The victim opened the till and gave money to the applicant. He said that he also wanted the coins and the victim put them into a plastic bag, handing them to the applicant. The applicant told the victim and other staff members to get onto the floor and then left taking over $200. 
     
      
    8 The other three robbery offences all arose from a single incident that occurred on 11 August 2005. The applicant entered a brothel and produced a loaded sawn-off shotgun from a bag he was carrying. He demanded that the occupants hand over money and mobile phones. There were three victims and hence three charges. The applicant then at gunpoint forced the group to the kitchen area where he demanded that the safe be opened. The manageress complied with this demand and $600 was handed to the applicant. The applicant later forced the manageress to accompany him away from the others into the front of the premises where he told her to pack the proceeds of the robberies into his bag. The applicant ran from the premises but was apprehended by police while trying to escape in a taxi. The police found that the shotgun that he had been carrying was cocked. 
     
      
    9 The firearm offences related to the fact that the applicant had in his possession a shortened firearm and that, being loaded and cocked, it was in a highly dangerous state so far as members of the public were concerned. 
     
      
    10 The applicant was born in Samoa on 6 June 1981. His father was a Seventh Day Advantist pastor who was a strict disciplinarian. As a result, at a young age the applicant went to live with an aunt and uncle. In 1990 he moved to Australia. At the age of 14 he started using drugs eventually resorting to heroin and cocaine. At the age of 16 he committed an armed robbery offence in order to finance his drug addiction. Since 2001, the applicant had been at large in the community for less than three months. At the time of sentence he had some support of his family, a brother was present in court, although the pre-sentence report indicated he had become estranged from the family. 
     
      
    11 The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge. He expressed remorse for the offences and a realisation of the effect of his crimes upon the victims. He had been serving his sentence in custody performing the duties of a sweeper. He stated that he intended to attempt to overcome his drug problem by carrying out programmes while in custody. However he admitted in cross-examination that he had completed a drug and alcohol rehabilitation course in prison before he was released to parole. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
      
    12 During the course of his sentencing remarks the judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “He has pleaded ‘guilty’ and I allow a discount of 15 per cent for the pleas of guilty for the utilitarian value.” 
        
       
      
    13 The applicant argues that, in light of the fact that the applicant pleaded guilty before the Local Court and adhered to those pleas in the District Court, the discount ought to have been at the maximum of 25 percent given the timing of the pleas and their utilitarian value. It was submitted that it was in effect unreasonable for the sentencing judge to deprive the applicant of a discount at the top of the range. 
     
      
    14 The Crown sought to rely upon material by way of affidavit filed in this Court setting out the history of the matter in the Local Court that indicated that the pleas of guilty did not come until over 11 months after the applicant’s arrest. The Crown estimated that there were more than a dozen mentions of the matter in the Local Court and that the pleas of guilty did not emerge until about five and half months after the prosecution brief was served on the defence. 
     
      
    15 Although this material might have been before the Judge in the District Court file it is highly unlikely that the Judge would have been aware of it. There is nothing in the submissions made by the parties to the sentencing judge that referred to any delay in the plea in the Local Court or that that delay should sound in a reduced discount. Further there is nothing in the sentencing remarks to indicate that the Judge determined to give less than the maximum discount by reason of any delay in the pleas of guilty in the Local Court. 
     
      
    16 Although it has been frequently stated that an offender is not entitled to any particular discount, the discretion in determining the extent of the discount should be exercised reasonably and according to principle. There was no reason why the sentencing judge should have reduced the discount otherwise appropriate for early pleas of guilty and where the Crown acknowledged that the utilitarian value of those pleas was significant. The discount given was one that would have been appropriate had the applicant pleaded guilty after committal to the District Court. It must be observed that it is difficult to see a discount of 15 percent reflected in the sentences actually imposed. 
     
      
    17 However, although the Judge’s discretion in respect of the discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty does seem to have miscarried, the question for this Court is whether some lesser sentence is warranted in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. That matter is to be considered having regard to the further grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
      
    18 It was submitted that the Judge erred in imposing sentences that were cumulative in respect of the three incidents represented by the five robbery offences. The applicant relied upon the principle that has been distilled from the decision of the High Court in Pearce as to the manner in which a court should sentence for multiple offences. In particular the applicant relied upon a concession made by the Crown appearing before the Judge that some partial concurrence was appropriate in relation to the sentences for the offences. It was submitted that the manner in which the Judge had structured the sentences failed to reflect that the offences were committed over a relatively short period of time and they had many features in common. It was argued that the manner in which the sentences were structured had resulted in a sentence that was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    19 It is clear, in my opinion that the approach that the Judge was following in determining the structure of the sentences so as to accord with the principle of totality was that considered in Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 rather than that for which Pearce has held to be authority. In Johnson the Court affirmed the decision in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 and confirmed that it was an appropriate course for a judge to reduce the sentences that might otherwise be appropriate for offences committed by an offender in order to achieve conformity with the totality principle when making those sentences cumulative. 
     
      
    20 In the present case counsel for the applicant conceded that a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment for three years would not be an appropriate penalty to reflect the criminality of the applicant in respect of any one offence of armed robbery if that offence were considered in isolation. In other words had the applicant been before the court for only one offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon committed while on parole for a similar offence, a fixed term of three years would have been manifestly inadequate. Clearly the Judge reduced the otherwise appropriate non-parole period for the first and second offences when determining that each should be punished by a fixed term of three years. However, in respect of the other three offences of robbery, his Honour chose to make the sentence for each of those offences concurrent between themselves, because they arose from a single incident of criminality, but that those sentences should be cumulative to the sentences imposed for the first and second robberies, which were separate and distinct incidents. 
     
      
    21 In my opinion the only possible error that his Honour might have committed in structuring the offences as he did was to determine that the sentences for the last three charges should be concurrent notwithstanding that there were three separate victims each of whom were threatened with the loaded rifle and from whom the applicant stole property. There are a number of decisions of this Court that indicates that it is appropriate to accumulate sentences where more than one victim is involved. 
     
      
    22 The question is whether an overall sentence of 13 years is excessive having regard to the totality of the criminality involved in the applicant’s offences in light of the fact that he was on parole for similar criminal conduct but having regard to his age and other subjective circumstances. In my opinion the overall sentence imposed upon the applicant was well within a proper exercise of sentencing discretion and in my view no lesser sentence is warranted notwithstanding that the applicant was given the benefit of a discount of only 15 percent for the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty. In reaching that decision I have taken into account material contained in an affidavit that was tendered to the Court as to courses undertaken by the applicant. 
     
      
    23 The criminality of the applicant was very grave indeed considering that while on parole and less than a month after his release from imprisonment he obtained a shortened loaded firearm and committed a series of armed robberies. The last incident was particularly serious in light of the fact that the firearm was not only loaded but apparently cocked during the course of the robbery when a number of persons were threatened with the firearm and required to hand money and valuables to the applicant. He had been given the benefit of a reduced sentence for an earlier offence of armed robbery on appeal to this Court largely because of his young age and prospects for rehabilitation: see R v Sua [2000] NSWCCA 84. In light of the chances offered to him to rehabilitate himself whilst in custody and with the advantage of early release to parole, he could expect little leniency in respect of the sentences for these serious offences. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
      
    24 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the Judge failed to carry out his intention to find special circumstances for the purpose of determining the appropriate non-parole period by the manner in which he structured the sentences imposed. During the course of his sentencing remarks the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Since these offences will involve a very long period of custody, he will require a lengthy period of post-custody supervision if he is to make good. To that extent I am prepared to find special circumstances, although, since there has to be accumulation of sentences, the ultimate result of the parole period may not reflect, in total, special circumstances such as to eventually affect the statutory equation. I cannot help that. The strictures of the legislation do not allow for that sort of arithmetical result.” 
        
       
      
    25 The overall sentence imposed by the Judge is not in accordance with the statutory ratio. The aggregate non-parole period is about 76 per cent of the aggregate total sentence. But it is clear in that the Judge intended that the applicant should spend a period of 10 years in custody before being eligible to be considered to parole. 
     
      
    26 In my opinion there is no error in the passage quoted from the sentencing remarks. It is reasonably clear that the Judge was indicating that, at least in respect of the sentences for the last three offences, he would fix a non-parole period having found special circumstances but that there may not be, at the end of the day, a reduction in the overall non-parole period from that in accordance with the statutory ratio. It has been held that the fact that a sentence is being made cumulative with another sentence can require a finding of special circumstances in relation to the last sentence imposed in order to have the overall sentence accord with the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the total term. It seems to me that this was what his Honour was intending to indicate in the passage quoted. 
     
      
    27 In my opinion the relationship between the overall non-parole period and the overall term of the sentence is not such that requires intervention by this Court. I am of the view that no lesser sentence than a minimum period of 10 years incarceration before the applicant is eligible to be considered to parole is warranted in view of the seriousness of the applicant’s offending, the need for both general and specific deterrence, and the failure of the applicant to benefit from the leniency that was shown to him the last time that he was before this Court. In other words no lesser sentence than that imposed by the Judge is warranted notwithstanding the failure of the sentencing judge to discount the sentences imposed upon the applicant by more than 15 percent for the early pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    28 I propose that the applicant be granted leave to appeal to this Court against the sentences imposed upon him but that the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Harrison J. 
     
      
    2 HARRISON J: The applicant pleaded guilty on 1 December 2005 to an indictment charging that between about 19 June 2004 on 15 December 2004 at Sydney and elsewhere he conspired to commit an offence against s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 to import into Australia a quantity of 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (commonly referred to as MDMA or ecstasy) being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that drug. 
     
      
    3 The maximum penalty prescribed by s 235(2)(c)(i) of the Customs Act 1901 for this offence is life imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $825,000 or both. 
     
      
    4 The applicant adhered to his plea before his Honour Andrew A-DCJ on 20 December 2005. His Honour determined that the starting point for an offence of this seriousness was imprisonment for a period of 16 years. This was reduced by 50 per cent due to the applicant’s plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 15 December 2004 and expiring on 14 December 2009 with a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 15 December 2009 and expiring on 14 December 2012. 
     
      
    5 The applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court against the sentence imposed. There are three grounds of appeal: - 
     
      
      5.1 The starting point at which the sentencing judge commenced the calculation of sentence prior to allowing for appropriate discounts was manifestly excessive having regard to what the applicant did in assisting the process of the importation of the quantity of prohibited drugs. 
       
       
      5.2 The starting point for sentence before allowing for appropriate discounts was excessive having regard to the age of the applicant and his relevant medical condition, which would make a sentence of imprisonment much more onerous for him. 
       
       
      5.3 The sentencing judge has erred in the calculation of an appropriate discount for the combined effect of the applicant's plea of guilty and the fact of his demonstrated willingness to assist the authorities with the investigation of the offence in which he was involved. 
       
      
    Background 
     
      
    6 His Honour was provided with a detailed statement of agreed facts.  
     
      
    7 The applicant ran a furniture business. At the request and direction of others in the scheme, the applicant took steps necessary to arrange for the importation of a shipping container of furniture from Europe. He dealt with the supplier of the furniture. The container was intercepted by the authorities and was found to have secreted within it a very large quantity of tablets that, when analysed, were found to contain 56.5kg of pure MDMA and 957.6g of pure methylamphetamine. The street value of the MDMA was estimated at $40 million. The container was ultimately delivered to an address used by the applicant in connection with his furniture business. 
     
      
    8 The tablets were discovered inside two large wooden crates concealed within sealed bags bearing labels for Horizon Espresso Coffee. The wooden crates were in turn found by customs officers inside a container of furniture. The shipping container was addressed to TMM Antiques and had been sent from a Belgian furniture company. TMM Antiques was a business name formerly associated with the applicant.  
     
      
    Ground 1 
     
      
    9 The applicant submitted that the first question to be determined was the level of the applicant's involvement in the importation: see The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [19]. His Honour dealt with this at page 7 of his remarks on sentence in the following way: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""On all of the evidence and on all of the circumstances I am satisfied that the [applicant] well knew that narcotics were being imported and that that involved a significant and substantial quantity. He had been offered $100,000. It was a specific import for an illegal purpose which is not part of the [applicant's] normal business activity. 
         
         
        I agree with the Crown's submission that whilst various others were involved in the importation and the secretion of narcotics in the shipping container the [applicant’s] role was a significant one. He made virtually all the arrangements and payments connected with the importation of the container. It was the [applicant’s] furniture business that provided a convenient cover for the importation of the MDMA secreted in the shipping container, containing furniture ostensibly for the [applicant’s] furniture business. The [applicant] travelled overseas with others involved in the venture. He liaised with the supplier of the furniture and those who provided the money for the purchase of the furniture. He performed specific tasks in Australia, including arranging for the relevant shipping and importation documentation and liaising with shipping and Customs agents. 
         
         
        I agree with the Crown's submission that ""it is clear however that much of what the [applicant] did was at the request or direction of others. The [applicant] does not appear to have been relevantly in charge of the venture and was not directly involved in the financing. Although on the evidence, and on the [applicant's] own account, he borrowed the equivalent of €9,100 from an associate of one of the co-conspirators to pay for the furniture. Nor is there evidence to suggest that the [applicant] was in any way involved in the sourcing of the narcotics. Nevertheless the [applicant's] role was essential to the importation of the narcotics"". 
         
         
        The [applicant] told police that he was to receive $100,000 for his role in the importation. The clear inference is that he knew from the beginning that the venture involved narcotics. He was plainly motivated by financial gain."" 
        
       
      
    10 The applicant in this Court does not challenge these general findings made by his Honour. Moreover, the applicant submitted that his Honour properly applied the principles set out in the passage from Olbrich at par [19] referred to above. It is instructive to record what his Honour said in this respect. The following is extracted from his Honour's remarks on sentence at pages 8-9: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""I turn to the role of the [applicant]. In sentencing for offences of this nature the Courts have often been at pains to identify the position of the person in the hierarchy that exists or is presumed to exist of those persons involved in the importation. But what is important is an assessment of what the offender has done in carrying out his role in the importation rather than trying to identify precisely the position of the offender in the hierarchy and endeavouring to achieve an exactitude in determining the appropriate sentence to accord with that position. See  
        R v Olbrich 
         (1999) 199 CLR 270. 
         
         
        I do not think that the [applicant] was the principal in the sense of the one who organised the importation in the first place; who sourced the drugs and who was motivated by and was to share in a huge financial gain. But he is a person who provided important assistance in the importation of quantities of the order of that here. He played a significant role in facilitating and making the importation possible, of what he must have known to be a very substantial quantity of drugs and was an active participant over a period of time and the importers needed someone to fill this role if the importation was to be successful and the offender was prepared to undertake that task. 
         
         
        The quantity of the drugs imported was very large. It's wholesale value was high. The part played by the [applicant] was significant. This is a very serious offence. It could be seen as an international conspiracy manifesting itself in a major importation of this quantity of a huge amount of drugs."" 
        
       
      
    11 The applicant did not dispute his Honour's reference in the passages just quoted to the applicant having played a ""significant role"" or to the fact that the assistance that the applicant gave to the organisers of the importation was ""important"". However, the applicant takes issue with his Honour’s description of the applicant's role as ""essential"". According to the applicant, the evidence suggests that the organisers of this importation would have gone to somebody other than the applicant in order to effect the importation if the applicant's services had been unavailable. 
     
      
    12 In support of the first ground of appeal the applicant submitted that he was in a vulnerable position by reason of the financial hardship he had suffered through being defrauded by one of his co-offenders. According to this submission, the applicant permitted himself to be used by others who appear to have instigated the project of the importation of prohibited drugs and to have used their initiative and expertise to bring the applicant into their illegal scheme. This is dealt with by his Honour in his remarks on sentence commencing at page 11 as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""Further by way of background it appears that [the applicant] had earlier been defrauded by one of his co-offenders, is said to be in the amount of $140,000 and in the report of John Taylor a clinical forensic psychologist it is noted the [applicant] said that when he did become aware that drugs were being imported with the furniture he did not tell the police as he was still hoping he could get back the $140,000 that he had previously invested. 
         
         
        I accept that financial hardship and a desire to recover money which he had lost was the motivation for his having committed this offence."" 
        
       
      
    13 His Honour’s finding regarding what he accepted to be the applicant's motivation for becoming involved in the importation is said by the applicant to be important. In the applicant's submission, this finding has to be linked to further positive findings relating to the applicant's personal qualities to which his Honour referred, including that he was a person of prior good character who had shown considerable remorse and contrition. In particular, his Honour referred to those matters at page 12 of his remarks on sentence: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""[The applicant] has never previously been convicted of any criminal offence. He is a man of prior good character. I accept that he has shown considerable remorse and contrition. He feels that he has shamed his family and himself. It is apparent that his remorse is genuine and I do not believe that he would ever re-offend. He has been assessed in that regard in the low range."" 
        
       
      
    14 I find the applicant's submissions in support of the first ground of appeal difficult to accept in the circumstances of the present case. Bearing steadily in mind the offence for which the applicant was sentenced, particularly having regard to the maximum penalty, his Honour appears to have made no discernible error at all. This was a single importation of drugs. The quantity and value of the drug was very high. In my opinion, his Honour was correct in assessing the applicant's role as significant and as one that both facilitated the importation and made it possible. It is to my mind wholly beside the point that the applicant’s co-conspirators could have found someone else to perform the applicant's role if he had declined to participate. In all likelihood, the same could be said of all or most of the other participants in this particular importation. 
     
      
    15 His Honour’s starting point, having regard to all relevant considerations, was well within the scope of his sentencing discretion. In the Crown's submission, it was in fact at the very bottom of the acceptable range of sentences imposed on persons involved in the importation of very large commercial quantities of ecstasy. 
     
      
    16 For example, in R v Shepherd (2003) 142 A Crim R 101; [2003] NSWCCA 287, a case involving the importation of ecstasy with the pure weight of 34.4 kg, the activities of the relevant offender, who, not unlike the applicant, ran an importing and exporting business, were described in the judgment of Howie J at [13] as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""[13] . . .The applicant's criminality arises from the fact that he was prepared, for whatever gain or other motive, to play a significant role in the importation of what he must have known to be a very substantial quantity of drugs. He had agreed to become involved in the importation in March 2001. He was an active participant from August until December 2001 by taking steps to facilitate the clearance of the container through the shipping company and customs. He had permitted premises that he had leased to be used to receive the container and to store some of its contents. The applicant was there when the container was delivered. He assisted in the removal of some of the contents, clearly believing that they contained drugs, and the loading of them onto a truck to commence their distribution."" 
        
       
      
    17 In R v Si Thanh To [2007] NSWCCA 200, Hulme J at [29] referred to Shepherd and to the effective starting sentence which was imposed as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""[29] Shepherd was 44 in November 2002 when sentenced, had no relevant criminal history and was described as an intelligent and industrious person. He appealed against a sentence of 14 years including a non-parole period of 9 years. Holding that the sentence was excessive, this Court reduced it to one of 11 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 7 years 4 months. Of significance for present purposes is the fact that the ground relied on by this Court for interfering was the discount for assistance which the Court held should, when combined with that for pleading guilty, be 45%. Working backwards, this indicates a period, prior to that discount of about 21 years. That figure was arrived at after a discount, allowed by the judge at first instance, of approximately 30% by reason of s16G of the Crimes Act. Although recording a concession by the Crown that the starting sentence, which seems to have been treated as about 32 years, was at the very top of the range, this Court made no criticism of it."" 
        
       
      
    18 The Crown referred to the review undertaken in R v Si Thanh To (supra) of some of the more recent sentences imposed from offences involving comparable importations of ecstasy and similar drugs. Relying upon this comparison, the Crown submitted that, whilst there will always be differences between the facts and circumstances in the reviewed cases and the present case, it may nevertheless be observed that virtually all of the cases reviewed involved effective starting points well in excess of the 16-year starting point adopted by his Honour in the present case. 
     
      
    19 In my opinion, Ground 1 is not made out. 
     
      
    Ground 2 
     
      
    20 This ground of appeal was, in effect, a further, more particular, submission in support of the first ground of appeal. The applicant was born on 1 July 1935. He submitted that his personal factors, most particularly his relatively advanced age and relatively poor health, and what was said to be the effect that those factors would be likely to have on the applicant when serving a sentence of imprisonment, demonstrated that the starting point adopted by his Honour was excessive. 
     
      
    21 His Honour dealt with these matters at page 10 of his remarks on sentence as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""Further in that report it is noted that 'the [applicant] is about seventy years of age. He suffers from a number of heart problems which recently required surgery. His parents are deceased but he enjoys the close support of four brothers and a sister who reside in Australia. He has three children from two previous relationships with whom he had regular contact'."" 
         
         
         
         ***** 
         
         
        ""He suffers from high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes for which he is medicated. He had triple bypass heart surgery late last year and he remains in recovery from that operation. His health is regarded as fragile. In addition to his chest and heart diseases he has been under the care of a colorectal surgeon for large bowel disease and a urologist for benign prostate enlargement. He suffers from sleep apnoea."" 
        
       
      
    22 His Honour had the benefit of a series of medical reports setting out the applicant’s physical and psychological conditions in some detail. One of those was a confidential psychological report dated 11 October 2005 prepared for the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services. Part of that report included the following material: - 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        Physical and Psychological History 
         
         
        [The applicant] reported an unremarkable birth. He denied ever losing consciousness or suffering from any psychological disturbances. [The applicant] described that since he has been incarcerated, he 'thinks too much' about his future and the worry gives him headaches. A number of times he spoke of how worried he is about dying in gaol. He also spoke of how upsetting his situation is, as he fled his own country due to poverty then worked hard all his life only to 'end up in gaol'. He said that gaol was 'not a good place' for him. During the interview he complained that he had not received sufficient medical attention since being incarcerated. 
         
         
        [The applicant] underwent triple bypass surgery late last year and reports that he is still recovering and requires weekly appointments with a General Practitioner. He also claimed to have blood pressure problems, prostate problems, and hernia problems. He denied ever having other serious illnesses or of undergoing other medical procedures. 
         
         
        Notes in the Justice Health Services Medical File indicate that [the applicant] is not in an urgent state and does not require weekly appointments. [The applicant] receives a number of medications for a variety of general issues and he has been referred to a specialist for the hernia condition. Justice Health Services indicated that it may take some time for [the applicant] to undergo the operation for his hernia."" 
        
       
      
    23 The burden of the applicant's submission is not that his Honour failed to take these matters into account at all, but that, having taken them into account, he then accorded them insufficient weight in the scheme of things. Specifically, his Honour referred to these matters at page 11 of his remarks on sentence in the following terms: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""Section 16A of the  
        Commonwealth Crimes Act 
         provides that 'the character, antecedents, cultural background, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person must be taken into account'. If I take into account his age and demonstrated poor health any incarceration will involve particular hardship and I think some medical risk. I take all that into account and know that as per case of  
        Hart 
         NSWCCA unreported 26 July 1999 that 'The offender’s psychological and medical health and age may increase the hardship of a sentence and may therefore be taken into account in deciding what sentence is appropriate but that consideration is limited by the necessity of maintaining proper standards of punishment'."" 
        
       
      
    24 The principal difficulty with this submission is that the applicant's medical condition would not appear to distinguish him from a significant proportion of the male population of the same age. The report of Dr Kumaradeva dated 25 January 2005 would appear to have been prepared with the benefit of his having treated the applicant in his general practice over a period of 10 years. At the date of the preparation of that report, the applicant had undergone his triple bypass operation some six weeks earlier. It is in my opinion significant in those circumstances that the only opinion offerred by Dr Kumaradeva was that ""in view of his age, and ongoing medical problems, his present incarceration will surely slow his recovery, and prevent his other conditions from being adequately cared for"". 
     
      
    25 The applicant has not sought to support the second ground of appeal upon the basis that imprisonment will prevent the applicant from receiving adequate care for his various medical conditions. Nor, as I understand the submission, does the applicant suggest that he has not fully recovered from his thoracic surgery, bearing in mind the serious nature of that surgery as generally understood. Rather, the submission is limited to the proposition that the applicant’s age and frail medical condition have not been properly taken into account in determining a starting point for the sentence. 
     
      
    26 His Honour was clearly mindful of the applicant's medical condition as his remarks on sentence reveal. His Honour referred in terms to the statutory obligation imposed upon him to have regard to it. Other than his complaint about the starting point for the sentence, however, the applicant has not identified or isolated any error in his Honour’s reasoning process that appears clearly, or even arguably, to have infected his sentencing discretion. His Honour does not appear to have disregarded relevant material or taken into account irrelevant material. 
     
      
    27 In my opinion, the second ground of appeal also fails. 
     
      
    Ground 3 
     
      
    28 His Honour dealt with the issue of the applicant's assistance at pages 12-13 of his remarks on sentence in the following passage: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""Further he provided information about the alleged involvement of persons in serious and organised crime including the creation of corporate entities that the ACC believes were created for suspected narcotic importations. That information is regarded as being potentially useful intelligence and 'may lead to further intelligence projects on other Sydney based criminal networks'. He has offered to give evidence in the knowledge that he places his life at substantial risk. That risk is assessed as both real and substantial. The Crown has decided however not to call him as a witness in other cases. For the [applicant’s] early plea of guilty and for assistance and co-operation I would assess an overall discount in sentence of fifty per cent for those factors."" 
        
       
      
    29 In R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92, her Honour Latham J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J agree, said at par [54]: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""[54] While there is no fixed tariff for assistance to the authorities, discounts customarily ranged between 20 percent and 50 percent. There have been comparatively rare cases where a discount in the order of 55 percent or 60 percent has been given. Generally speaking however, a discount of 50 percent is regarded as appropriate to assistance of a very high order. No doubt, that is in part a reflection of the principle that a discount for assistance must not produce a result which is disproportionate to the objective gravity of a particular offence and the circumstances of a particular offender."" 
        
       
      
    30 In SZ v Regina (2007) 168 A Crim R 249; [2007] NSWCCA 19, Buddin J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""[51] It is timely to reiterate that sentencing judges should be careful to ensure that the component of the discount which relates to the promise of  
        future assistance 
         should be specifically quantified with a degree of precision. That allows the parties to know exactly what the position is and will also enable an appellate court to deal appropriately with any review brought by the Crown in the event that such a promise is not fulfilled. See generally  
        R v Halls and Halls 
         (2002) 127 A Crim R 209;  
        R v Waqa (No 2) 
         (2005) 156 A Crim R 454. In Commonwealth matters of course a sentencing judge is required, by reason of s 21E of the  
        Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
        , to identify the component which relates to future assistance. "" 
         
         
        ""[52] I acknowledge, as did Latham J in  
        Sukkar 
         (supra), that there will be cases in which a combined or composite discount of more than 50% is called for. There may well be a case in which the assistance proffered is of a quite extraordinary kind. Alternatively there may be a case in which the offender is entitled to an additional discount, in accordance with the principles enunciated in  
        R v Ellis 
         (1986) 6 NSWLR 603, on account of having disclosed information which was otherwise unknown to the authorities. Indeed, composite discounts in excess of 50% have been allowed on several occasions when this Court has proceeded to re-sentence following a successful appeal by an offender. See, for example,  
        R v NP 
         (supra);  
        R v OPA 
         [2004] NSWCCA 464 and  
        R v AMT 
         [2005] NSWCCA 151."" 
        
       
      
    31 The applicant submitted that the finding in his case, that because he has provided assistance there is a ""real and substantial"" risk that his life is in jeopardy, is a matter of some considerable significance. The applicant submitted that this kind of assistance might legitimately be categorised as falling within an exceptional category. It is said to contrast significantly with the position that existed in Sukkar (supra) where Howie J observed at par [6]:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""[6] In the present case there was simply no evidence that the respondent was at risk by reason of the assistance he had given or that the assistance would have impacted at all upon the manner in which he would be required to serve his sentence. There was no evidence placed before this Court in answer to the Crown appeal to show that in any way the respondent had been disadvantaged by the fact that he had given assistance. The Judge erred in the discount given to the respondent for his plea and assistance and one of the reasons is because he made the unjustified assumption that imprisonment would be more onerous for the respondent because of the assistance provided."" 
        
       
      
    32 The present case involves no question of future assistance. The Crown submitted that the discount of 50 per cent given by his Honour was at the top of the range for discounts customarily given for assistance which, at least until recent times, were generally of the order of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent. 
     
      
    33 Moreover, the reference to the risk to the applicant's life as being ""both real and substantial"" appears in the context of the applicant’s offer to give evidence for the prosecution in the future which, it is acknowledged, places his life at substantial risk. The Crown has since decided not to call the applicant as a witness in any case. Additionally, it does not follow from the finding relating to the risk to the applicant's life that he will necessarily serve his sentence in more onerous conditions: see Sukkar at [6] (supra). 
     
      
    34 As recently as 1991, Gleeson CJ in R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220, had this to say at 232: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is a common feature of cases where leniency is being sought on behalf of a person who has co-operated with the authorities that the argument in favour of such leniency comes from the Crown as well as the offender. The prosecuting authorities themselves have gained, or hope to gain, from the assistance in question, and it is understandable that they regard it as advancing the interests which they represent to see that such assistance is suitably and publicly rewarded. There is, however, usually no-one to put an opposing or qualifying point of view. This raises the need for special care on the part of the judge. The Court must be astute to ensure that it is being given accurate, reliable, and complete information concerning the alleged assistance and the benefits said to flow from it. Public confidence in the administration of criminal justice would be diminished if courts were to give uncritical assent to arguments for leniency, which are being jointly urged by both the prosecution and the defence, in circumstances which may call for a close examination of the alleged assistance. Care must also be taken to ensure that the ultimate sentencing result that is produced is not one that is so far out of touch with the circumstances of the particular offence and the particular offender that, even understood in the light of the considerations of policy which support the principles set out above, it constitutes an affront to community standards. If sentencing principles are capable of producing an outcome of that kind, then that calls into question their legitimacy."" 
        
       
      
    35 I do not consider the applicant's position to be exceptional. Upon the basis of the material before his Honour, the “valuable assistance” to authorities which the applicant had agreed to give was, on one view of the matter, likely to be of limited value. This is because the Crown had decided that it would not utilise the applicant as a witness in later cases. However, this is a factor to which his Honour appears to have had little, if any, regard.  
     
      
    36 From the applicant’s point of view, there is no meaningful distinction between an offer to put his life at risk by promising to give assistance to authorities, which a sentencing judge knows will not be utilised, on the one hand, and either a demonstrated history of assistance or an offer to do so in the future, which a sentencing judge knows will be utilised, on the other hand. In the nature of things, the consequences for the applicant are unlikely to be different in either case. At the time of sentencing the applicant, his Honour knew that the Crown had decided not to call him in other cases. However, his Honour appears in no way to have diluted the significance of the applicant’s offer. Indeed, the description of the risk to the applicant’s life as both real and substantial suggests that his Honour accorded it the highest significance. He referred to it as “potentially useful intelligence”. In my opinion, this is more than adequately reflected in the discount which was given.  
     
      
    37 It is important to remember that public confidence in the administration of criminal justice would be potentially diminished if this Court were to give uncritical assent to arguments for leniency in circumstances where a close examination of the alleged assistance revealed it to be illusory. This is not such a case. However, a sentencing judge is necessarily constained by the principles referred to by Gleeson CJ in R v Gallagher (supra) and the same principles must be borne in mind by this Court when considering whether or not his Honour erred in the present case. 
     
      
    38 In my opinion, Ground 3 is not made out. 
     
      
    Further submissions 
     
      
    39 During the hearing of the application, an issue arose concerning the question of parity between the sentnce imposed on the applicant and that imposed on a co-offender George Nikolic. His Honour Donovan DCJ sentenced Mr Nikolic to a term of 16 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years following conviction by a jury on an identical charge. This was precisely the same term of imprisonment adopted by the sentencing judge in the present case before the application of the 50 per cent discount referred to earlier. 
     
      
    40 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the objective criminality of Mr Nikolic’s conduct was no less serious than that of the applicant. In particular, it was suggested that the role played by the applicant in the relevant importation was no greater than that played by Mr Nikolic. His Honour Donovan DCJ observed that there was some suspicion that Mr Nikolic’s role was greater than the applicant but that there was no material that would promote Mr Nikolic’s role to any significant degree above that of the applicant. Furthermore, the personal circumstances of Mr Nikolic did not distinguish him from the applicant in any relevant respect. 
     
      
    41 Paragraph 4 of the applicant’s supplementary written submissions encapsulated his argument on the issue of parity in this Court. It was in the following terms: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""The applicant does not contend that there is a stark contrast between the sentences imposed on Mr Nikolic and the applicant. However, the fact that a person in his position - that is an old man with an unblemished record who is vulnerable to exploitation, and who seems on the available evidence to be lower in the hierarchy of the criminal organisation than Mr Nikolic, should receive the same sentence, before allowing for appropriate discounts, as his co-offender means that the applicant's relevant personal circumstances for the purpose of sentence have not been given adequate weight."" 
        
       
      
    42 In my opinion, there are at least two difficulties with that submission. First, factors such as criminal history, vulnerability and age are matters which his Honour clearly took into account. His Honour referred to these matters in terms in his remarks on sentence when he said, ""I take into account . . . his age of 70 and the fragile state of his health and that this is his first offence"". His Honour also had regard to the material referred to in the Probation and Parole report. Most of this material has already been referred to in consideration of Ground 2 and it is unnecessary to repeat it. The applicant’s submission clearly raises a complaint about the way in which his Honour balanced the competing factors, but fails in my opinion to highlight or demonstrate error in the way in which he exercised his sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    43 Secondly, I am not satisfied that it has been demonstrated that the applicant and his co-offender occupied relevantly different levels of the criminal hierarchy. There is no doubt that their respective roles were different, since they had different functions to perform as part of the criminal enterprise. But the differences do not all favour the applicant. For example, Mr Nikolic remained in Australia during the whole of the period of the conspiracy. In contrast, the applicant left Australia and travelled to Europe for some time.  
     
      
    44 Between pages 2 and 10 of his remarks on sentence his Honour Donovan DCJ set out a detailed analysis of Mr Nikolic’s role in the conspiracy and a comparison of it with the role performed by the applicant. It is unnecessary for present purposes to refer to the whole of that material. However, some of his Honour’s conclusions following that exercise are instructive. For example, at page 11 his Honour made the following comment:: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""The defence submits that although Nikolic and [the applicant] had different roles to fulfil and had different objectives and there were different circumstances and they have a different relationship with Ulic and Trifunoski, nevertheless in substance each had an equivalent responsibility. Nikolic had his role to play and [the applicant] had his role to play."" 
        
       
      
    45 A little later, on page 12 of his remarks on sentence, his Honour said this: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""While there may be some suspicion that Nikolic’s role was greater than [the applicant], it seems to me that both were under the direction of Ulic and Trifunoski and each had their own roles to carry out in circumstances which seem to me to suggest that the responsibility and criminality of each was, in general terms, equivalent. I can find no facts beyond reasonable doubt which increase Nikolic’s role to any significant degree above that of [the applicant]. Both were very actively and very centrally involved in this importation."" 
        
       
      
    46 There is no doubt that his Honour Donovan DCJ took into account matters of parity when imposing the sentence on Mr Nikolic. Both the defence and the prosecution agreed that he should do so, even though the prosecution submitted that Mr Nikolic’s role was greater than that of the applicant. To this end, his Honour referred in detail to the remarks on sentence of his Honour Andrews A-DCJ in the present case. 
     
      
    47 In these circumstances I am not satisfied that the applicant could have a justifiable sense of grievance at the sentence imposed upon him either because the sentencing judge misunderstood the relative roles in the conspiracy occupied and performed by him and Mr Nikolic respectively, or that as a result of a comparison between the sentences that were imposed on them, he received a sentence that was disproportionate to his role. Moreover, it would be inappropriate in the present case, except in the face of a demonstrably unjust disparity, to revisit the sentence imposed on the applicant because of an allegedly unfavourable comparison with the sentence imposed on his co-offender, when his Honour Donovan DCJ so carefully and painstakingly had regard to the applicant’s sentence in any event. Even accepting the applicant’s submissions at their highest, any disparity between the two sentences is not in my opinion such as would warrant intervention by this Court on the basis that some less severe sentence than that imposed on the applicant was warranted in law and should have been passed. 
     
      
    Orders48 I would propose the following orders: - 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal granted. 
       
      2. Appeal dismissed.

     REGINA v Bin HUANG 
      
     REGINA v See Hon SIU 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: These are Crown appeals from sentences imposed upon co-offenders, Bin Huang and See Hon Siu. In each case the Crown asserts the sentence is manifestly inadequate. The appeals raise common questions, and it is convenient to consider them in the one judgment. Mr Odgers SC represented both respondents at the hearing of the appeals. 
     
      
    2 The Crown appeal against the sentence imposed upon the respondent Huang was heard on 28 March 2007. The Court was informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions was considering an appeal against the sentence imposed upon the respondent Siu who had been sentenced on 9 March 2007. The parties agreed that we should not deal with the appeal against Huang’s sentence until we were aware of the position regarding Siu and that, if there were an appeal by the Crown in respect of the sentence imposed upon him, it would be appropriate for the same bench to deal with both matters. Hence the Court reserved after hearing argument in the matter of Huang until the situation in respect of Siu’s sentence was clarified. An appeal was lodged by the Crown against Siu’s sentence on 5 April 2007. We heard the Crown appeal against the sentence of Siu on 30 July 2007. 
     
      
    3 A third alleged co-offender, Chen, is to stand trial in September 2007.  
     
      
       
      The respondent Huang 
      
    4 This respondent pleaded guilty to an indictment alleging that between 14 January 2003 and 4 November 2003, at Sydney New South Wales, [he] dealt with money and intended that the money would become an instrument of crime, namely an offence against section 31(1) of the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 and at the time of the dealing the value of money was $1,000,000 or more, namely $3,088,311.00, contrary to sub-section 400.3(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment for 25 years and/or a fine of $165,000. 
     
      
    5 The facts of the matter were that between 14 January and 4 November 2003 the offender conducted 335 banking transactions. Each involved a sum of less than $10,000. Each transaction was conducted at either a Commonwealth or Westpac Bank. The total amount of money conveyed to Hong Kong, and China generally, as a result of Huang’s activity was $3,088,311 achieved by those 335 bank transactions. The respondent’s motive was financial, as he received a fee for each transaction. These fees totalled approximately $30,000. 
     
      
    6 On 1 September 2006 Charteris DCJ sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for three years to commence on 18 December 2005. He directed the respondent enter a recognizance at the expiration of one year and nine months pursuant to section 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to be of good behaviour for three years. These orders would result in the respondent being released from custody on 17 September 2007. 
     
      
    7 His Honour found  
     
      
       
        
       
      (a) The respondent believed that the money had been acquired through a genuine business venture in Australia and that the sole purpose of forwarding the funds overseas in sums of less than $10,000 was to avoid Australian Taxation. It was accepted by the Crown that the funds were not illegally obtained. 
       
       
      (b) The offence was objectively very serious having regard to the considerable sum involved, the number of transactions, the period over which it occurred and that it involved considerable planning and organisation though it was not an activity that could be described as sophisticated. 
       
       
      (c) The principal used the respondent and others as a runner or courier to present the cash at the bank. His Honour accepted, however, that the respondent was a “very much-trusted employee” of the principal who was given possession of large sums of money. It is apparent that he did not breach that trust placed in him by the principal. The respondent played an important role. 
       
       
      (d) The respondent had gambled to excess in Australia and that was the cause of his need for funds which led to him being tempted to involve himself in the behaviour for which he was before the court. The offender was in some way in denial as to the extent of his gambling difficulty. 
       
      
    8 His Honour also found  
     
      
       
        
       
      (a) The respondent was born on 27 October 1967. He was educated to the equivalent of year 12 standard in China and also completed a two-year Diploma in English Studies. He has an excellent command of English. He came to Australia from China in December 1989 and in 1994 was granted permanent residency. In 1996 he became an Australian citizen. He married in 1997 and the marriage ended in divorce. He married a second time and his second wife has returned to China due to her employment commitments. He has a minor criminal record, with fines for two stealing offences and a driving matter. He was also before the Local Court in 1998 for contravention of apprehended violence orders, which related to his first marriage. The funds that were banked by the respondent were provided by the principal in whose seafood business the respondent worked. 
       
       
      (b) The respondent had provided assistance to investigating authorities which was “extremely valuable” and “truly exceptional”. This material included admissions as to many particular transactions which would have been very difficult for the authorities to establish. The respondent’s current classification in prison was of “non association” and he would be subject to protective custody in the future, which would be burdensome. A discount slightly above 25 percent to reflect his cooperation, both past and future, with the authorities was allowed. 
       
       
      (c) He was satisfied the respondent “has great contrition”. He allowed 25 percent for the plea of guilty and also a discount for contrition of a month or so. 
       
       
      (d) The respondent did not require any further personal deterrence though the  
      Criminal Code 
       required significant penalties to be imposed, and general deterrence loomed very much. 
       
      
    9 His Honour took as his commencing point a sentence of 6½ years which he reduced by 25 percent for the plea of guilty and also a small discount for general contrition. This reduced the sentence to four years and nine months with a non-parole period of three years. He then allowed a discount slightly above 25 percent for cooperation with the authorities, thus reducing the head sentence to three years and he reduced the minimum period to be served to one year and nine months. 
     
      
       
      The respondent Siu 
      
    10 This respondent pleaded guilty to an indictment alleging that between 6 May 2003 and 14 July 2003 at Sydney, [he] dealt with money and intended that the money become an instrument of crime, namely an offence against section 31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth), and at the time of the dealing the value of the money was $100,000 or more, namely $556,400, contrary to sub-section 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment for twenty years and/or a fine not exceeding $132,000. 
     
      
    11 The facts of the matter were that between 6 May 2003 and 14 July 2003 the respondent conducted 59 structured transactions. He approached the Commonwealth and the Westpac Banks at various branches in and around Sydney, depositing amounts of just less than $10,000, ranging from $9,700 to $9,400. The total amount transmitted to Hong Kong bank accounts as a result of his conduct was $556,400. The motive was financial, as the respondent received a fee for each transaction. The total fee received was something less than $3,000. 
     
      
    12 Geraghty DCJ sentenced the respondent to a period of imprisonment of two years and eleven months to commence on 9 March 2007. The Judge directed that he be released at the expiry of one year of that sentence, namely on 8 March 2008, upon entering into a recognizance pursuant to section 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) to be of good behaviour for a period of three years from 8 March 2008. 
     
      
    13 The sentencing judge found the overall enterprise was very sophisticated with large amounts of money being illegally transferred to Hong Kong. The respondent’s role was not that complex and he was told what to do by the principal. His Honour found that the respondent’s role in this enterprise was limited and that he was on the edge of the enterprise, although an important component of it, since he was a “well-trusted player” for those who were illegally sending money to banks in Hong Kong. 
     
      
    14 His Honour had no doubt that the respondent knew he was involved in illegal activity. Initially he believed the moneys he was depositing were proceeds of an abalone business. However, he left the enterprise before he was charged because in effect he had become aware that the enterprise was likely to involve more than abalone and could be serious and dangerous. His Honour considered that, even if the respondent believed the funds came from abalone trading, from his earlier involvement in that trade he must have known it was illegal. 
     
      
    15 His Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
       
      (a) The respondent was sixty-four years of age and on a disability pension at the time of the offence. He had been raised in Hong Kong and had moved to Australia in 1982. He was a married man. He had limited English and was in poor health, suffering from a number of medical conditions. He had a prior criminal record for illegal activities in relation to the abalone trade.  
       
       
      (b) There had been an early plea of guilty, the utilitarian value for which should result in a 25 percent discount. 
       
       
      (c) The respondent’s contrition and remorse expressed to various people was limited to his regret that he had been exposed by the police and charged. 
       
       
      (d) The respondent had originally given assistance to the police but then had withdrawn his willingness to participate. Later, he again agreed to cooperate. However, his assistance was never availed of due to his lack of credibility and reliability as a witness. His Honour considered there should be some allowance made for his willingness, however variable, to cooperate, but since his assistance was not used, this consideration should be quite limited. 
       
       
      (e) A discount of 35 percent for the plea, expressions of remorse and subjective cooperation was appropriate. 
       
       
      (f) A full time custodial sentence would be much harder for the respondent than for a healthy young male by reason of his medical conditions. His Honour took that factor into consideration. 
       
       
      (g) The respondent had no psychiatric, gambling or drug problems and the likelihood of re-offending was “somewhat low”. 
       
       
      (h) The offence was committed between May and July 2003, the respondent was charged in April 2005 and thereafter there were many adjournments, none of the delay being caused by the respondent. His Honour took into account the delay as a mitigating factor. 
       
       
      (i) There were special circumstances, being the respondent’s age, health, lack of facility with English, and the fact that his family resided in Victoria. 
       
       
      (j) General deterrence for these particular offences was a very important consideration. 
       
      
    16 In sentencing the respondent, his Honour took a notional starting point of four and a half years, which he reduced by 35 percent for the discounts previously referred to. 
     
      
    17 His Honour considered the question of parity between this respondent and the co-offender, Huang. He concluded there was a considerable difference between the respondent and Huang, namely that the transaction amount in Huang was over $3,000,000, with the result that the maximum sentence was imprisonment for 25 years rather than 20 years; the offences by Huang were committed over a longer period than those by the respondent; Huang was more involved in the enterprise and was much younger and his state of health was not compromised, as was the respondent’s. 
     
      
       
       
       
      The Crown submissions 
      
    18 The fundamental submission put by the Crown in each appeal was that the commencement point taken by the sentencing judge was too low to reflect the offender’s criminality having regard to the maximum penalty applicable to the offence. In particular the Crown relied upon the decision of this Court in R v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342 as indicating the seriousness of the conduct in which each of the respondents engaged. Special leave to appeal to the High Court against that decision has been refused; see [2007] HCATrans 49. It was also submitted that too much weight was given to subjective circumstances, and in particular, in the case of Huang, to his gambling addiction. In the case of Siu the Crown submitted that the judge sentencing him was too concerned to achieve parity with the sentence imposed upon Huang, yet the sentence imposed upon that respondent was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    19 The Crown drew the Court’s attention to the relevant principles that operate in a Crown appeal and the discretions that are available to this Court in determining such a matter. It quoted in the written submissions from a number of decisions setting out the principles that are to be applied in such a case including the passage from R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 where Wood CJ at CL sought to summarise the matters relevant to the determination of an appeal alleging that a sentence is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
       
      The submissions on behalf of the respondents 
      
    20 It was submitted by Mr Odgers SC on behalf of both the respondents that the Court should have regard to the offence that each of the respondents set out to commit in dealing with the money intending that it become an instrument of crime. This was a breach of s 31(1) of the Financial Transactions Reports Act (the FTR Act). He noted that the offence was committed by two or more reportable transactions of amounts of less than $10,000 and that the maximum penalty for any one offence was Imprisonment for 5 years. 
     
      
    21 Mr Odgers referred to the breadth of the money laundering sections in Division 400 of Chapter 10 of the Code by reason of the definition of the various terms used in the offence-creating provisions. It was submitted that the range of conduct, which can be encompassed by the offence, is so broad that it extends from the merely trivial to the very serious. It was submitted that within this range of conduct the activity of the respondents fell toward the lower end. Mr Odgers gave examples of what he suggests were the possible absurd results that could flow from the breadth of the offences and the stated maximum penalties. 
     
      
    22 He referred to the decision of the High Court in Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447 stressing the importance of discriminating between the seriousness of offences by the conduct of the offender and not simply the fact that the offence committed falls into a particular category of offence for which a general maximum penalty has been prescribed. There is no implication, it was submitted, that the fact that an offender committed an offence under the money laundering provisions means that no regard should be taken of the actual criminal activity intended to be carried out, here being a structuring offence in breach of the FTR Act. 
     
      
    23 In relation to the respondent Huang Mr Odgers stressed the findings of the sentencing Judge in the respondent’s favour as set out above. He also submitted that the respondent’s belief that the funds were lawfully obtained was of especial significance. In this regard he contrasted the case of R v Z where the respondent knew that the money was the result of drug trafficking. Although he conceded that tax evasion is serious criminal activity and the respondent knew that he was assisting in that criminal conduct, it was a far cry from helping to dispose of the proceeds of serious criminal activity. Mr Odgers stressed that the respondent’s gambling problems made him vulnerable to becoming involved in criminal activity and was a mitigating factor. 
     
      
    24 In relation to the respondent Siu, Mr Odgers referred to cases in this Court considering sentences imposed for breaches of s 31(1) of the FTR Act. In R v Hutton [2004] NSWCCA 60 for 21 offences totalling $427,393 the appellant was sentenced to 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 18 months. It was submitted that in light of this sentence and others referred to the respondent’s sentence could not be viewed as inadequate in light of the findings made by Judge Geraghty.  
     
      
    25 Mr Odgers conceded that the respondent Siu was aware that the money was the proceeds of illegal activity but noted that he had not been dealt with for an offence in relation to the proceeds of crime. But he accepted that the source of the money is a relevant factor where the offender knows that the money was illegally obtained. However, he stressed that illegal abalone fishing was not in the same league of seriousness as that involving the distribution of illegal drugs as was the case in R v Z. 
     
      
       
      Determination 
      
    26 The nature and scope of offences of money laundering under Division 400 of the Criminal Code were considered recently by this Court, as presently constituted, in Ansari v R [2007] NSWCCA 204. That case involved a Crown appeal against sentences imposed upon two respondents convicted after trial of two charges of conspiracy to commit offences under s 400.3(2). They were co-offenders of Z. One of the points that was noted in determining that appeal was that Z. was not sentenced on the basis that he was aware that the money that he delivered to the Ansari brothers was the proceeds of drug trafficking. It may have been and he may have known that it was, but it was not a fact relied upon by the Court in determining the sentence that ought to have been imposed upon him. 
     
      
    27 Before referring to what was stated in Ansari about the offences in the Division, it is necessary to make reference to the relevant provisions of the Code so that the offences committed by the respondents can be seen against the scheme of the section. Section 400.3 is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        400.3 Dealing in proceeds of crime etc -- money or property worth $1,000,000 or more 
         
         
        (1) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
         
          
          (a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
           
          (b) either: 
           
            
            (i) the money or property is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or 
             
            (ii) the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 
            
           
            
           
          (c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more. 
          
         
         
         Penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years, or 1500 penalty units, or both. 
         
         
        (2) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
         
          
          (a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
           
          (b) either: 
           
            
            (i) the money or property is proceeds of crime; or 
             
            (ii) there is a risk that the money or property will be-come an instrument of crime; and 
            
           
            
           
          (c) the person is reckless as to the fact that the money or property is proceeds of crime or the fact that there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime (as the case requires); and 
           
          (d) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more. 
          
         
         
         Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 years, or 720 penalty units, or both. 
         
         
        (3) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
         
          
          (a) the person deals with money or other property; and 
           
          (b) either: 
           
            
            (i) the money or property is proceeds of crime; or 
             
            (ii) there is a risk that the money or property will be-come an instrument of crime; and 
            
           
            
           
          (c) the person is negligent as to the fact that the money or property is proceeds of crime or the fact that there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime (as the case requires); and 
           
          (d) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more. 
          
         
         
         Penalty: Imprisonment for 5 years, or 300 penalty units, or both. 
         
         
        (4) Absolute liability applies to paragraphs (1)(c), (2)(d) and (3)(d). 
        
       
      
    28 As Simpson J pointed out in Ansari, the section in effect provides for six separate offences: three concerned with dealing in money or property that is proceeds of crime and three concerned with dealing in money or property that is to become an instrument of crime. The offences are further broken down in relation to the mental element of the offender: belief/intention, or recklessness, or negligence. The prescribed maximum penalty depends upon the culpability of the offender’s mental state concerning the source of the money, for offences involving proceeds of crime, or what is to become of it, for offences involving an instrument of crime. Hence the respondent Huang was liable to a maximum penalty of 25 years, because of his intention to deal with the money as an instrument of crime, this being the most serious of the mental states with which the section is concerned. 
     
      
    29 The same structure applies to offences involving more than $100,000 by the provisions in s 400.4. The respondent Siu was liable to a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment because he was charged with intending that the money with which he dealt, $556,400, would be used as an instrument of crime. This is the most serious offence under s 400.4. 
     
      
    30 In Ansari, Z. and the Ansari brothers were liable to imprisonment for 12 years. This was because, although they intended to deal with money in excess of $1 million, the mental element of the offence was recklessness as to the use of that money as an instrument of crime. In other words they were dealt with on the basis that they were reckless as to whether the money would be used for a criminal purpose, in each case a structuring offence contrary to s 31(1) of the FTR Act. On the count for which Z was sentenced, being the second count against the Ansari brothers, the amount of money to be involved was about $2 million but it was never actually dealt with by Z. or the brothers because police arrested Z. before he could obtain it. The Ansari brothers were sentenced on the basis that they knew the money was to be used for tax evasion but there was no evidence as to their knowledge of the source of the funds. There was no finding in that respect in the case of Z. 
     
      
    31 Howie J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated the following in relation to the offences within Division 400: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [118]  
        Division 400 of Pt 10.2 of the Code is entitled ""Money laundering"". For the purposes of the Division the term ""instrument of crime"" is defined in this way; ""money or other property is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence)"". There is also a definition of ""proceeds of crime"" being ""any money or other property that is derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence)"". There is a wide meaning given to the term ""dealing with money or other property"" in s 400.2. It includes receiving or disposing of the money, importing it into or exporting it out of Australia and engaging ""in a banking transaction relating to money or other property"". 
         
         
        [119]  
        The offences within the Division, therefore, apply to a large range of activity in relation to money or other property to be used in connection with, or arising from, serious crime. Not only is there a very wide ambit in relation to the conduct caught by the offences but there is also a substantial range of criminal activity to which the money or property could relate, being limited in effect to an indictable offence of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory. The offences are not concerned only with the source of the money or property that is dealt with but also its ultimate use. The offences cover money obtained illegally or to be used for illegal purposes or dealt with in a manner that is illegal. 
         
         
        [120]  
        With offences that are so wide ranging in their scope it becomes somewhat difficult to imagine an offence falling within the worst category of its kind against which any particular offence can be measured. It might be thought that dealing with money that is to be used for the purposes of terrorism might be within the class of the most serious offences encompassed by the sections in the Division. But it is perhaps not so difficult to conceive of offences that will form the bulk of conduct falling within the scope of the Division that would come before the criminal courts. The most obvious will relate to money obtained as a result of drug activity and that is being dealt with in order to make it more difficult to track or identify as the proceeds of a particular crime. It may also be money that has been legitimately earned but is to be dealt with in such a way as to disguise its source in order, for example, to defraud the taxation office. 
         
         
        [121]  
        But frequently it will be impossible for the authorities to identify the origins of the funds or what is ultimately to be the use made of them, yet it can be shown that the manner of dealing with them was a breach of the law, such as to avoid the mandatory reporting conditions under the Financial Transactions Reporting Act. It may be the case that the persons dealing with the money do not know its source or ultimate destination and do not care provided they are being paid for rendering a service. 
         
         
        [122]  
        The legislation itself has attempted to structure offences to give some guidance as to the seriousness of the conduct by reference to the applicable maximum penalty for each offence. The scheme is that the greater the sum of money involved, the more serious the offence. But the legislation also takes into account the mental state of the offender, so that an offence involving the intentional dealing with proceeds of crime or instruments of crime is more serious than one where the state of mind is recklessness as to the criminal nature of the property. Therefore s 400.3(1), where the amount involved is more than a million dollars and where the offender believes that the property is the proceeds of crime or intends that it will become an instrument of crime, provides for the most serious of the money laundering offences carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and/or 1500 penalty units. 
         
         
        [123]  
        It is likely that an offender before the court for sentencing for an offence within the Division will be a person facilitating the laundering of the money or actually involved in that process, rather than the owner of the money or the beneficiary of the laundering. The prosecution may not be able to show that the offender knew of the source of the money or its ultimate destination. In  
        Assafiri v R 
         [2007] NSWCCA 159 an analogy was drawn between money laundering offences and drug importations in that both types of offences usually reveal a hierarchy of persons involved in the conduct who have different roles to play and different gains to be made from the commission of the crime. The most important consideration in sentencing an offender for an offence under this Division will be to consider what the offender did, because there may be little or no evidence before the court as to the organisation behind the offence, the source of the funds or the ultimate use to made of them: see  
        R v Olbrich 
         (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [19]. 
         
         
        [124]  
        However according to normal sentencing principles, if the Crown wants to submit that the particular offence is aggravated by a circumstance that makes it more serious than objectively it would appear to be from the bare conduct of the offender, for example because the money with which the offender dealt was known by him to be intended to support terrorism, then the Crown should prove that fact beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if the offender seeks to mitigate the seriousness of the apparent conduct by some fact, for example that the offender believed the funds were to be used for a humanitarian purpose, then it would fall to the offender to prove that fact on the balance of probabilities. Where however the accused denies the offence or there is no evidence as to his state of knowledge of the source of the funds, the purpose of dealing with the funds or their ultimate destination, the Court must simply deal with the matter on the objective facts as proved by the evidence…………. 
        
       
      
    32 Notwithstanding the Crown submissions to the contrary before this Court, we are of the opinion that the offender’s belief as to the source of the funds will always be a relevant consideration regardless of whether the offender is charged with an offence concerned with the proceeds of crime or an offence concerned with property being used as an instrument of crime. Where it is the latter, the belief as to the source of the funds or its nature is less relevant because the offence is directed at the use to be made of the funds. So the offence of the respondent Siu was aggravated because he believed that the funds were as a result of illegal activity, albeit the activity was not of the utmost seriousness. 
     
      
    33 The understanding of the offender as to what was to be the destination of the money or the purposes for which it was to become an instrument of crime is also a relevant consideration. In the present case it was a significantly aggravating factor that the respondent Huang believed that he was actively involved in dealing with the money for the purpose of evading the payment of tax. But as was stated in Ansari, this is not a matter that is decisive of the seriousness of the particular offence or the appropriate penalty. 
     
      
    34 The amount of money involved is clearly a highly significant matter because the legislation uses it as the principal means of dividing the offences into categories and it is the primary identifier of what is the maximum penalty for an offence. The only difference between an offence falling within s 400.3(a), and carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years, and an offence falling within s 400.4(a), and carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years, is the amount of money or the value of the property with which the offender dealt. 
     
      
    35 Of course the number of transactions carried out by the offender in committing the offence and the period over which the transactions occurred are significant because they indicate the extent of the offender’s criminality. Generally speaking a number of transactions involving small amounts of money will be more serious than a single transaction of a larger amount. The latter may be seen as an isolated offence. 
     
      
    36 We are of the opinion that in the case of each of the respondents his criminality fell generally within the midrange of offending covered by the relevant sections. Money laundering on the scale in which both respondents were involved should be considered as serious criminal activity that is at the very heart of organised, professional crime syndicates. It warrants severe punishment not the least in order to reflect general deterrence of a very significant degree. When the activity is engaged in for profit, over a significant period of time and with a large number of transactions, the prior good character of the offender is of less significance than might otherwise be the case. 
     
      
    37 Sentences that have been imposed for offences in breach of s 31(1) of the FTR Act are not a helpful guide to the sentence to be imposed for an offence contrary to s 400. This is not simply because of the difference in the maximum penalties prescribed for the different offences. Depositing sums of money in breach of the provisions of that Act to the extent that was embarked upon by the respondents and taking into account their knowledge of the purpose of the transactions imbues their criminal activity with a completely different complexion. 
     
      
    38 Each of the respondents was well aware of the illegality of his conduct: Huang knew that the funds were to be used for an illegal purpose and Siu knew they were obtained as a result of illegal activity. The respondents were prepared to become involved in serious criminal conduct for profit. They were not isolated acts of offending. There were 59 separate illegal transactions undertaken by the respondent Siu over a period of about two months. There were 335 illegal transactions entered into by the respondent Huang over a period of about 11 months. 
     
      
    39 The respondent Siu dealt with over $550,000 slightly over half of the amount of money that would have taken him into the higher penalty of a s 400.3 offence and over five times the amount of money bringing him within a s 400.4 offence. The respondent Huang dealt with over $3 million, more than three times the amount that brought him within a s 400.3 offence. Neither of them was a principal in that they did not own or have an interest in the money with which they dealt. Although that is clearly a matter that reduces the culpability of each, they were both involved in the principal’s illegal conduct to a very substantial degree. Both Judges who dealt with the respondents made findings that they were important and trusted participants in the enterprise. 
     
      
    40 In R v Z the Court was of the opinion that the respondent’s offending warranted a starting sentence of 7 years imprisonment before discount as against a maximum penalty of 12 years. As we have already noted that sentence was not based upon any knowledge of Z. as to the source of the funds. It involved what was to be a single act of dealing with money, so far as Z. was concerned, and the offence was not carried out. He was not a principal in the offence but was to obtain and courier the money to the Ansari brothers. Z. suffered from a mental disorder that mitigated to some degree the sentence to be imposed upon him. He was to be kept in protective custody because of his former membership of the Israeli army. 
     
      
    41 In Ansari the Court was of the opinion that the sentence that ought to have been imposed on each brother should have been 9 years on each of the two counts. They were principals in the money laundering in that they were receiving the money in order to “wash it” on behalf of the owners of the money for profit. The first offence involved somewhere over $1 million, although the sentencing judge did not determine the exact amount, and the second offence was to involve at least $2 million. They were convicted after trial. 
     
      
    42 In the case of the respondent Huang, it was of little, if any, mitigation that the offence was a result of gambling. In R v Assi [2006] NSWCCA 257 it was stated [27]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………….Although [the appellant’s] gambling habit may explain his fall into such serious criminal conduct and give some hope of rehabilitation in the future, it has been held to be a rare case where an offender can seek mitigation of penalty based upon an addiction to gambling, even where it is pathological:  
        R v Molesworth 
         [1999] NSWCCA 43…….. 
        
       
       
      Because of the numerous criminal activities committed by the respondent over a substantial period of time, this is not the rare case where the respondent’s problems with gambling should be seen as significantly mitigating his criminality. 
       
      
    43 The respondent Huang should be considered as more than a mere courier or runner to deliver the money to the bank having regard to his involvement in depositing the money in false accounts. But even if he were limited to that role, in light of the large number of illegal activities and the very significant amount of money involved such a role would not be a matter of very great mitigation. Judge Charteris was in error in determining that a separate and quantifiable discount was appropriate for contrition: see R v MAK and MSK (2006) 167 A Crim R 159. Discounts totalling 54 per cent for pleas and assistances were unjustified: see R v SZ [2007] NSWCCA 19. 
     
      
    44 None of these errors might themselves singly or in combination justify this Court intervening especially in light of the fact that the respondent was to be released to parole in September next. But the sentence is manifestly inadequate as a result of the notional starting sentence chosen by his Honour before applying discounts. The Judge’s starting point was 6½ years. In our opinion it should have been at least 11 years although we believe that a more appropriate starting point was between 12 and 14 years. We have chosen the lowest possible figure because this is a Crown appeal. We are prepared to grant the respondent a discount of 50 per cent for the plea and assistance, although we acknowledge that this is a very generous finding notwithstanding that the respondent will spent his time in some form of protective custody. 
     
      
    45 The lowest sentence that it was within the Judge’s discretion to impose upon the respondent Huang to reflect his criminality and against a maximum penalty of 25 years was 5½ years. There should be a non-parole period of 3 years 4 months. We emphasise that this is a lenient sentence imposed mainly because of discretionary factors arising from a successful Crown appeal. 
     
      
    46 In the respondent Siu’s case the Judge was in error in describing the respondent’s conduct as “one of the least serious” of criminal conduct that could be encompassed in the section. As we have indicated, money laundering on a scale of that embarked upon by the respondent, involving over a half a million dollars and repeated criminal acts over a period of three months, was very substantial criminal activity and warranted a severe, deterrent sentence. The offence was committed for profit, but the amount received by him was of little significance, other than that it disclosed his position in the enterprise. There was limited mitigation in the respondent’s age and medical condition. His medical problems were largely present at the time of the offending and neither age nor physical illness is a licence to commit crime particularly over a period of three months. The delay in the respondent being charged was of little significance unless it could be shown to have disadvantaged the offender in some way. 
     
      
    47 The starting sentence before applying discounts should have been at least 8 years although we believe a more appropriate starting point was between 9 and 11 years. As this is a Crown appeal, we have adopted the lowest sentence in the available range. The respondent was entitled to a discount for the plea of 25 per cent. The Judge also gave the respondent the benefit of a discount of 10 per cent for past assistance. A total discount of 35 per cent was overly generous, especially as the Judge took into account in fixing that discount remorse and because of the lack of any benefit from his proffered assistance. But we are prepared to grant him the same discount. The head sentence should have been at least 5 years. In coming to the view that the Court ought to intervene and in fixing the sentence, we have taken into account an affidavit of the respondent as to his medical problems while in custody. The sentence is the very least that could be imposed upon the respondent to reflect his criminality. 
     
      
    48 The non-parole period imposed by the Judge was about a third of the head sentence. That was manifestly inadequate. The Judge found special circumstances, but that was a finding that only applied in respect of sentencing for State matters. These included the respondent’s age and “compromised state of health” but these were matters principally to be taken into account in determining the head sentence. But as we have already noted, they lose much of their significance because they were present at the time of the offending. The fact that his family was in Victoria and that the respondent was isolated by his lack of English were of limited significance in light of his offending in this State over a period of three months. Some reduction in the usual ratio should be allowed but not to the degree determined by the sentencing judge. The minimum sentence must adequately reflect both the offender’s criminality and the significance of general deterrence. There should be a minimum term of 2½ years. Again it should be noted that the sentence imposed upon the respondent is considerably reduced from that which ought to have been imposed in the District Court. 
     
      
    49 Judge Geraghty was keen to address parity between the two respondents. To some degree that issue should take care of itself because they were sentenced under different offences with different maximum penalties. A proper determination of the criminality of each and their subjective circumstances should have resolved any issue of parity between them. One major difference was that Huang received an overall discount of the sentence of 54 per cent where as Siu was given a discount of 35 per cent. That has resulted in there not being a very substantial difference between the head sentence to be served by Huang and that by Siu. However, by reason of Siu’s personal circumstances he is to serve less than Huang before being eligible for release to parole. 
     
      
    50 The Court makes the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        In respect of the respondent Huang 
         
         
        1. The Crown appeal is allowed. The sentence imposed by Charteris DCJ is quashed. 
         
         
        2. The respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for 5½ years to date from 18 December 2005. There is to be a non-parole period of 3 years 4 months to expire on 17 April 2009, the date upon which the respondent is eligible to be released to parole. 
         
         
        In respect of the respondent Siu 
         
         
        1. The Crown appeal is allowed. The sentence imposed by Geraghty DCJ is quashed. 
         
         
        2. The respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years to date from 9 March 2007. There is to be a non-parole period of 2½ years to expire on 8 September 2009, the date upon which the respondent is eligible to be released to parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to a number of charges of sexual interference with his daughter and his granddaughter. On the charges relating to the granddaughter, he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment aggregating two years and eight months with a non-parole period of two years, dating from 11 May 2005. On the charges relating to his daughter he was sentenced to terms aggregating ten-and-a-half years with a non-parole period of seven-and-a-half years, dating from 11 November 2006. The overall sentence, then, was imprisonment for twelve years with a non-parole period of nine years. 
     
      
    3 He seeks leave to appeal against the sentences on the charges relating to his daughter. I shall refer to those sentences with greater particularity later. There were nine such charges, arising from events which occurred between 1974 and 1982 and brought under sections of the Crimes Act which have since been repealed. The first six charges were of indecent assault of a female under sixteen years of age, an offence under s76 of the Act which carried a maximum sentence of six years imprisonment.  
     
      
    4 The first three offences were committed in 1974, when the complainant was six years old. Of those, the first two arose from the same incident. The fourth and fifth offences, also arising from the same incident, were committed during a period between 1976 and 1977 when she was eight. The sixth was committed during a period between early 1980 and mid-1981, when she was between the ages of eleven and thirteen. 
     
      
    5 The seventh and eighth charges were also of indecent assault, but they were brought under s61E of the Act, which replaced s76 and which also carried a maximum sentence of six years because of the complainant’s age. The seventh offence was committed in a period between mid-1981 and mid-1983 when she was twelve or thirteen years old. The eighth was committed during the same period, but at a time when she was thirteen or fourteen.  
     
      
    6 The ninth charge was of carnal knowledge of a girl between the ages of ten and seventeen years by her father, an offence under s73 of the Act which carried a maximum sentence of fourteen years imprisonment. It also was committed at a time when she was thirteen or fourteen. 
     
      
       
      Facts  
       
      
    7 There was an agreed statement of facts before the sentencing judge. No purpose would be served by reciting the details of each offence. It is sufficient to say that the behaviour giving rise to the eight counts of indecent assault comprised the appellant touching the complainant’s vagina, penetrating her digitally and having her touch his penis. The ninth count, carnal knowledge, arose from an occasion when he had penile/vaginal intercourse with her in a neighbour’s swimming pool. The penetration was brief, and she was able to swim away from him and get out of the pool.  
     
      
    8 The indecent assaults were part of a wider and persistent pattern of abuse over the period of about eight years embraced by the charges in the indictment. The granddaughter to whom I referred was the child of the daughter whom the applicant had abused. The offences against that girl were committed in 2002, and she complained of them to her mother after reading a book designed to help adolescent girls with issues of puberty. Her mother then reported to police her own abuse and that of her child.  
     
      
    9 The applicant admitted the offences in a recorded interview with police. Indeed, he volunteered information about his conduct beyond that which his daughter had alleged. The seventh and eighth charges were based entirely upon his admissions. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case  
       
      
    10 The applicant was fifty-nine years old at the time of sentence. He had no criminal record and was well regarded in the Christian community to which he belonged. That reputation, of course, had to be viewed in the light of his long standing pattern of offending. As the sentencing judge put it, his “apparent good character” was “of less value to him because he was in fact a whited sepulchre”. 
     
      
    11 As one might expect, he had been in protection since being taken into custody and his Honour thought it likely that he would remain “in some form of protected and therefore further constrained custody”. He expressed remorse for his offences in a letter to his Honour, as he had to a psychiatrist, Dr Delaforce, who provided a report. Dr Delaforce was of the opinion that there was “a low risk” that he would re-offend.  
     
      
    12 His Honour recognised the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty, together with the fact that they spared the victim the ordeal of re-living her experiences through giving evidence. He also noted that the seventh and eighth charges were the result of the applicant’s disclosure of conduct which may not otherwise have come to light: cf R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. For those factors his Honour allowed a general discount of sentence of one third. He added that, while that might be a “somewhat generous” allowance in respect of the sentences individually, its effect was “offset by the accumulation, and enhanced by the concurrency” of the sentences which he proposed.  
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    13 Counsel for the applicant, Mr Dhanji, argued the application on three grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) That his Honour erred in the manner in which he took into account uncharged sexual conduct of the applicant; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) That his Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances pursuant to s44(2) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        ; and 
        
       
       
        
        (3) That the sentences, individually and in their combined effect, are manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
      Uncharged sexual conduct  
       
      
    14 The first ground arises from the following passages in his Honour’s remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        … it is the fact that each of the offences to which the prisoner has pleaded and for which he is to be sentenced, are but examples of an ongoing pattern of debauchery to which he subjected his daughter over the period from 1974 to about 1983. 
        
       
       
        
        Each sentence therefore is to be taken as referring not just to the act, but to the context in which the act occurred, namely, that it was part of this continuing pattern of misconduct.  
        
       
       
      Later, referring to the offences against both the daughter and the granddaughter, his Honour said: 
       
       
        
        …clearly, the sentences ought to reflect each the seriousness of the individual offence, and overall the very long and intergenerational serious criminal activities of the prisoner.  
        
       
      
    15 It is well established that a sexual offender standing for sentence for offences which are part of a wider pattern of abuse is to be sentenced only for the crimes of which he has been convicted. The only relevance of other sexual activity is to place the offences charged in their context and to deny the offender the leniency to which he might have been entitled if they were isolated incidents. That principle was affirmed by Spigelman CJ, after an extensive review of authority, in R v JCW (2000) 112 A Crim R 466.  
     
      
    16 Mr Dhanji submitted that it is apparent from the quoted passages that his Honour used the evidence of uncharged sexual conduct to increase the sentence otherwise appropriate for each of the offences. He relied, in particular, on that part of the first of the passages in which his Honour said that each sentence was to be taken “as referring not just to the act, but to the context in which the act occurred,” and his observation in the second passage that the sentences should reflect “the seriousness of the individual offence, and overall the very long … criminal activities of the prisoner.”  
     
      
    17 I must say, with every respect to a most experienced sentencing judge, that his Honour might have expressed himself more felicitously. What he sought to convey would have been put beyond doubt if he had spoken in terms of denying the applicant the leniency which he might have earned if the offences charged were isolated lapses. However, I accept the Crown prosecutor’s submission that that is what his Honour meant in those passages and, in particular, by his reference in the first passage to “the context” in which the offences occurred. I am satisfied that his Honour did not fall into the error for which Mr Dhanji contended.  
     
      
    18 I should add that Mr Dhanji took no point about his Honour’s description in the second passage of the applicant’s criminal activity as “intergenerational.” He did not argue that his Honour had erroneously inflated the sentences for the offences against the daughter because of the applicant’s abuse of his granddaughter. 
     
      
       
      Special circumstances  
       
      
    19 I have referred at the beginning of these reasons to the overall sentence his Honour passed for the applicant’s offences against his daughter. It is convenient now to record the sentences for each of those offences. They were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Counts 1 & 2: Concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for eighteen months, dating from 11 November 2006; 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 4 & 6: Concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for eighteen months, dating from 11 May 2007; 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 3 & 5: Concurrent terms of imprisonment for two years and eight months, dating from 11 May 2008, each comprising a non-parole period of two years and a balance of term of eight months; 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 7 & 8: Concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for eighteen months, dating from 11 May 2010; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 9: Imprisonment for six years, dating from 11 May 2011, comprising a non-parole period of three years and a balance of term of three years. 
        
       
      
    20 It will be remembered that all of the counts except the ninth were charges of indecent assault. The third and fifth counts involved digital penetration. The ninth count, visited with the longest term of imprisonment, was the charge of carnal knowledge. On all counts except the third, fifth and ninth, his Honour passed fixed terms of imprisonment.  
     
      
    21 The sentences for each of the third and fifth counts, a non-parole period of two years with a balance of term of eight months, maintained the normal proportion between non-parole period and balance of term prescribed by s44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It was only in respect of the sentence on the ninth count, a non-parole period of three years with a balance of term of three years, that his Honour departed from that statutory proportion. He did so only because of the accumulation of the sentences.  
     
      
    22 The overall sentence of ten-and-a-half years with an effective non-parole period of seven-and-a-half years also departs from the statutory proportion, albeit only slightly. As I have said, the addition to that overall sentence of the sentences for the offences against the granddaughter produces a total sentence of twelve years with an effective non-parole period of nine years. That total sentence, of course, maintains the statutory proportion. This is consistent with his Honour’s conclusion that, putting aside accumulation, there were no special circumstances requiring him “to interfere with the proportions set in the legislation.”  
     
      
    23 For this ground of the application, Mr Dhanji relied upon authority bearing upon the fact that the applicant had stood for sentence in 2006 for offences committed between 1974 and 1982. It was settled in R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368 that a sentencing Court dealing with old offences such as these should, as best it can, replicate the sentencing practice of the period when the offences were committed. His Honour in the present case noted that “some care needs to be taken in not applying current standards of punishment to these offences.”  
     
      
    24 The approach in MJR was developed further in AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51, a case involving sexual offences committed between 1979 and 1982, in which the Court had regard specifically to the practice at that time of setting non-parole periods: see the leading judgment of Howie J at [34] ff. Howie J noted that the specification of non-parole periods was then governed by the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 which, unlike the current legislation, did not prescribe a prima facie proportion between non-parole period and head sentence. Such a statutory proportion was first introduced in the Sentencing Act 1989, which was repealed and replaced by the present Act.  
     
      
    25 During the period with which that case was concerned, Howie J observed, a non-parole period was usually somewhere between a third and a half of the length of the sentence. His Honour concluded that that practice might itself be sufficient to constitute special circumstances justifying departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period under the present regime. Indeed, his Honour said at [37] that the Court in that case “should endeavour to apply the practice that existed in 1982 in specifying a non-parole period because that practice would favour the applicant.” 
     
      
    26 The decision in AJB was handed down after the applicant was sentenced. The Crown prosecutor in this Court acknowledged the principle enunciated in that case, but sought to distinguish it on its facts. That applicant had made out a much more favourable subjective case than the present applicant. The Crown prosecutor submitted that in this case an effective non-parole period lower than that which his Honour imposed would be inadequate to reflect considerations of retribution and deterrence. Of course, as Howie J noted in AJB at [38], it has long been the law that a non-parole period should serve that function.  
     
      
    27 However, in my view, the approach taken in AJB is applicable here and justifies a finding of special circumstances, quite apart from other subjective features which might have done so. A relatively modest reduction of the non-parole periods for counts three, five and nine would produce minimum terms which are still effective to mark the applicant’s criminality.  
     
      
       
      Manifestly excessive?  
       
      
    28 Mr Dhanji submitted that the sentences are, in any event, excessive. He acknowledged the undoubted gravity of the applicant’s criminality, involving the abuse of his daughter over a lengthy period of time. However, he noted that only one of the nine offences involved penile/vaginal penetration, and argued that all of the offences fell well short of the worst of their kind.  
     
      
    29 He also noted that his Honour had discounted the sentences generally by one third in recognition of the applicant’s pleas of guilty and his admissions of misconduct. That being so, the starting point for the sentences of two years and eight months on counts three and five must have been four years, against a statutory maximum of six years. Likewise, the starting point for the sentence of six years on count nine must have been nine years, against a statutory maximum of fourteen years. None of those offences, he argued, warranted a starting point of that order. Moreover, he said, those starting points failed to take account of the extent to which his Honour accumulated the sentences. 
     
      
    30 The Crown prosecutor submitted that the sentences were within the bounds of the proper exercise of his Honour’s discretion. She relied upon the nature of the offences, the period over which they were committed, and the applicant’s relationship to the victim. She noted the age of the victim at relevant times: R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575, per Simpson J at [35]. As I have said, she also argued that his Honour could not have specified non-parole periods lower than he did.  
     
      
    31 I think that there is force in Mr Dhanji’s submissions. He did not direct any argument specifically to the fixed terms of eighteen months imprisonment for the counts other than the third, fifth and ninth, or to the manner in which his Honour accumulated the sentences. However, as I have said, the overall sentence for the offences relating to the daughter is ten-and-a-half years which, after the one third reduction, reflects a starting point close to sixteen years. I might add that the overall sentence for the offences against both the daughter and the granddaughter, twelve years, conveys a starting point of eighteen years.  
     
      
    32 The one third discount was generous and, putting those notional starting points to one side, it is necessary to examine the sentences which his Honour did pass to determine whether any lesser sentence is warranted in law: s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. I am satisfied that a reduction of the sentence on the ninth count is called for, for the reasons identified by Mr Dhanji. I would be reluctant to alter the sentences on the third and fifth counts, the more serious charges of indecent assault. However, in arriving at the sentence of imprisonment for two years and eight months passed on each of those counts, it is clear that his Honour determined a non-parole period of two years and then added to it a balance of term maintaining the statutory proportion. As I would take a different approach to the non-parole period for those offences, I would reduce each of those sentences slightly.  
     
      
    33 As I have said, I would also vary the proportion of the non-parole period to each of those three sentences, while being careful not to reduce them to a point at which they fail to reflect the gravity of the applicant’s criminality or which would produce an aggregate non-parole period which fails to do so.  
     
      
       
      Re-sentence 
       
      
    34 For the purpose of re-sentence we received an affidavit of the applicant, which attests to his continued status as a protected prisoner and to difficulties he faces in prison because of a problem with his health. It also expresses his willingness to undertake educational courses, as well as counselling which might help him to address the causes of his offending behaviour.  
     
      
    35 The task of re-sentence is not easy, any more than was the sentencing task which confronted his Honour. I would maintain the fixed terms of imprisonment for eighteen months for the counts of indecent assault other than the third and fifth. I would also maintain the commencement dates of the sentences for the first, second, fourth and sixth counts, and would accumulate the sentences in the same manner that his Honour did. For the third and fifth counts, I would substitute concurrent sentences of imprisonment for two-and-a-half years with a non-parole period of eight months. That non-parole period, of course, is the same as the fixed term of imprisonment on the other indecent assault counts, but the more serious nature of those two counts is reflected in the head sentence. For the ninth count, the offence of carnal knowledge, I would substitute a sentence of imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of two years.  
     
      
    36 I would structure the sentences in such a way as to produce, for the offences in respect of the applicant’s daughter, an aggregate term of nine years with an effective non-parole period of six years. The proportion of that non-parole period to the aggregate sentence is higher than one might have expected at the time the offences were committed, but I do not believe that a lower minimum term would be sufficient to reflect the gravity of the applicant’s criminal conduct. Accumulating those sentences upon the sentences for the offences against the granddaughter, in the manner in which his Honour did, produces an overall aggregate term of ten-and-a-half years with an effective non-parole period of seven-and-a-half years. 
     
      
    37 Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed. 
        
       
       
       (2) For counts 1, 2, 4 and 6, the sentences are confirmed. 
       
       
        
        (3) The sentences for counts 3 and 5 are quashed. In lieu, the applicant is sentenced on each count to a non-parole period of eighteen months, commencing on 11 May 2008 and expiring on 10 November 2009, and a balance of term of twelve months, commencing on 11 November 2009 and expiring on 10 November 2010. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) For counts 7 and 8, the sentences are confirmed but each is to commence on 11 November 2009 and to expire on 10 May 2011.  
        
       
       
        
        (5) The sentence on count 9 is quashed. In lieu, the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of two years, commencing on 11 November 2010 and expiring on 10 November 2012, and a balance of term of three years, commencing on 11 November 2012 and expiring on 10 November 2015. 
        
       
       
      The applicant would thus be eligible for release on parole on 10 November 2012. 
       
      
    38 SMART AJ:  Much of the background is set out in the judgment of Hidden J. 
     
      
    39 I agree with the reasons of Hidden J for rejecting the appeal ground based on the manner in which the judge took into account the uncharged sexual conduct of the applicant. I also agree with the conclusions he has reached as to the sentences he proposes be imposed on Counts 3, 5 and 9 and for the reasons he has given. I make the following additional comments. 
     
      
    40 The sentencing judge correctly regarded the offences the subject of Counts 3 and 5 as graver than the offences the subject of Counts 4 and 6. Count 4 involved the applicant requiring his daughter to touch his erect penis. The conduct the subject of Count 5 was part of the same course of conduct as the conduct the subject of Count 4. Count 5 involved digital penetration when the daughter was aged about 8 years. 
     
      
    41 Count 3 involved digital penetration of the daughter when she was aged about 6 years. Count 6 involved the applicant requiring his daughter to masturbate his erect penis when she was aged 11-13 years. 
     
      
       
      
    42 I agree with Hidden J that the sentencing practice which existed in the period 1974-1982 constitutes a special circumstance. See AJB v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 51at [38].43 Sentencing for offences committed in 1974, 1976-1977 and 1982 was governed by the Parole of Prisoners Act  1966. In Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 the High Court considered the Parole of Prisoners Ordinance 1971 (ACT) and certain decisions of this Court, the differences between that Ordinance and the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 (NSW) being held to be immaterial for the purposes then under consideration. The joint judgment of four Justices held that in setting a non-parole period the sentencing judge should fix the minimum period of confinement that justice requires to be served, that is the minimum period of imprisonment that the crime committed calls for. The High Court overruled decisions of this Court on the New South Wales Act. 
     
      
    44 I do not need to refer to the Probation and Parole Act 1983 which replaced the 1966 Act nor the Sentencing Act 1989. 
     
      
    45 In Deakin v R (1984) 54 ALJR 765 at 766 the joint judgment of five Justices stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          The intention of the legislature in providing for the fixing of minimum terms is to provide for mitigation of the punishment of the prisoner in favour of his rehabilitation through conditional freedom, when appropriate, once the prisoner has served the minimum time that a judge determines justice requires that he must serve having regard to all the circumstances of his offence: see  
          Power v R 
           (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 629. 
          
         
        
       
      
    46 After the decision in  Power, the judges of this State followed the High Court decision as to the principles to be applied in setting non-parole periods (or minimum terms). Generally, they set non-parole periods of half to one-third of the aggregate sentence as intimated in AJB but there were instances where longer non-parole periods were set. 
     
      
    47 Under the 1966 Act there was no stipulation as to the relationship between the non-parole period and the overall sentence. Section 4 of that Act provided that in respect of a person sentenced after that Act commenced and who was not at the time he was sentenced serving a term of imprisonment, the Court - 
     
      
       
        
        (a) shall, where the sentence is for a term of imprisonment of more than 12 months; and 
         
         
        (b) may, in any other case 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          specify a non-parole period before the expiration of which that person shall not be released on parole. 
          
         
        
       
      
    48 With sentencing under the 1966 Act, after  Power,  Courts, in practice tended to impose lengthy head sentences and, as mentioned, non-parole periods that varied from about one-third to one-half of the head sentence or, where there was more than one sentence of the aggregate sentences. Prior to Power  the non-parole periods were probably shorter. See R v Portolesi [1973] 1 NSWLR 105 at 107 and  R v Sloane [1973] 1 NSWLR 203 at 206. 
     
      
    49 The applicant was sentenced under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 44(1) provides that the Court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence, that is the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence. Section 44(2) provides that the balance of the term must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more. The sentencing regime existing many years ago is a special circumstance. The statutory stipulation is an affirmation of the principle held to be applicable by the High Court in Power and  Deakin. In practice, concepts as to what is the minimum period required to be served have risen since those decisions. 
     
      
    50 In R v MJR  (2002) 54 NSWLR 368 a Court of five judges by a majority of four to one, held that a sentencing Court should take into account the sentencing practice as at the date of the commission of an offence when sentencing practice has moved adversely to an offender. The observations of Mason CJ and McHugh J in Radenkovic v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 623 provided powerful support, but not binding authority, for such an approach, those Justices saying, inter alia, at 623: 
     
      
       
        
        … when a court of criminal appeal is called upon to re-sentence because it has quashed the sentence initially imposed, considerations of justice and equity ordinarily require that the convicted person be re-sentenced according to the law as it stood at the time when he was initially sentenced, particularly when that law was more favourable to him than the law as it existed at the hearing of the appeal …  
        
       
      
    51 In the seminal case of  R v Shore (1992) 66 A Crim R 37 at 42 Badgery Parker J with whom Mahoney JA and Hunt CJ at CL concurred expressly approved the trial judge's approach: 
     
      
       
        
        … I should, so far as I am able to do so, seek to impose upon the offender a sentence appropriate not only to then applicable statutory maxima but also to then appropriate sentencing patterns. That is by no means easy but I must endeavour to do so.  
        
       
      
    52 That was described as ""completely correct"" and neither party (both being represented by experienced counsel) submitted otherwise. Shore was applied in R v Watson [1999] NSWCCA 227 at [26] by a two judge bench and in  R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 by Whealy J. He pointed out that the Court in Shore had extensive material before it as to the sentencing practices which existed at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    53 I do not subscribe to the view that there has to be a mechanistic approach to t he earlier practice. It is sufficient if substantial regard is had to it when sentencing practice has moved adversely to an offender. 
     
      
    54 I do not favour an approach that goes back to 1974-1982 and endeavours to predict what the Court would have concluded would happen as to rehabilitation and/or non commission of other similar offences when there is material available as to those matters of what has happened. Fact rather than prediction and speculation is preferred. 
     
      
    55 I agree with the orders proposed by Hidden J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Sammy Testalamuta, pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following charges: 
     
      
       
      (1) Breaking and entering a dwelling house, knowing there to be a person inside, and being armed with a dangerous weapon, a gun, and committing therein a serious indictable offence, namely, threatening to cause injury to a person to be called as a witness in judicial proceedings, intending to influence him not to attend court as a witness: an offence of specially aggravated breaking and entering under s112(3) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      ;  
       
       
      (2) Maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm: an offence under s33 of the Act. 
       
      
    3 Both offences carry a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of seven years. In addition, the applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account on a form 1 an offence under s93G(1)(c) of the Act, that is, carrying a firearm in a manner likely to endanger the safety of another person. 
     
      
    4 He had embarked upon a trial on a different indictment, which included a charge of shooting with intent to murder and the charge of carrying of a firearm in a manner likely to endanger the safety of a person. However, on the second day of the trial he pleaded guilty after a fresh indictment was presented containing the two charges I have set out above, and on the basis that the firearm charge would be taken into account on a form 1. 
     
      
    5 On each charge in the indictment, taking into account the form 1 matter in connection with the first of them, the applicant was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for fifteen years, to commence on 7 November 2003, comprising a non-parole period of ten-and-a-half years and a balance of term of four-and-a-half years. He seeks leave to appeal against those sentences.  
     
      
       
      Facts  
       
      
    6 The sentencing judge summarised the facts in his remarks on sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Prior to the events that give rise to these offences, the victim [Stephen Sheath] and Patricia Mathews had been involved in a de facto relationship. They had two children during that relationship. Those children had resided with the victim since October 2002. It was around that time that Ms Mathews had commenced a relationship with the offender.  
        
       
       
        
        On 15 December 2002 the offender was charged with assaulting the victim Sheath and causing him actual bodily harm. This matter arose during an argument over access for Ms Mathews to one or more of her children. The assault occurred whilst the victim was holding one of the children and it was by means of punching and kicking. It was a condition of his bail in connection with that matter that he not approach the victim’s premises. In breach of his bail condition, on the evening of 6 November 2003, the offender went to the victim’s home. The front door was closed. It is clear that he forced it open using the sole of his foot. At this time, the victim and his young son, then aged five, were in the lounge room of the house playing an electronic game. The other child was not there but with the grandmother. When the victim stood up, the offender said to him: “Do you fucking think you’re going to court tomorrow.” Sheath replied: “Yes, I fucking am.” The hearing of the assault charge against the offender was scheduled for the Liverpool Local Court on 7 November, that is the following day. The offender said in response to the victim: “Right, we will see about that.” 
        
       
       
        
        At this point, the victim noticed the offender was carrying a silver pistol. He told his son to go out the back. His son complied with that direction and the offender [victim?] ran out after him. When he was near the back door, the victim saw the offender was behind him and still holding the gun. He noticed the offender had transferred it to his left hand and pulled back a lever with his right hand. This appears to have been a cocking mechanism. The offender then said that he was going to kill the victim. The gun went off and the bullet struck the victim in the upper thigh. It apparently passed through his leg. The wound began to bleed.  
        
       
       
        
        The victim went out the door and went up to the side of the house to check on his son. Having seen that his son was uninjured and at the front of the house, he returned to the back door to see if the offender had gone. When he looked through the screen door, he was surprised to see that the offender was still in the kitchen. At this time, the offender was standing near the refrigerator. He, that is, the offender, said: “You’re gone mate. You’re fucking gone this time.” The offender then reached into his pocket and pulled out another bullet. The victim tried to lock the screen door and he called out to a passer-by to call the police. 
        
       
       
        
        After the offender had kicked the screen door three or four times, he repeated: “You’re fucking gone, mate,” and then discharged the gun. The bullet entered the victim’s hand, as it was against the screen door. When the victim saw the offender trying to reload the gun again, he opened the door, went into the kitchen, picked up a chair and swung it at the offender hitting him on the arm. The offender ran out of the kitchen to the front of the house. The victim went and collected his son. 
         
         
        The offender was seen to enter a white BMW and drive it away. This was seen by a witness, Mr Sinclair, who noted the number plate of the vehicle. When this particular witness glanced at the offender, when the offender was sitting in the car, the offender pointed the gun in the direction of the witness. However it was not discharged. 
        
       
      
    7 His Honour went on to record that police and ambulance were called, and the victim was taken to hospital. The gunshot wound to his leg was sutured. The injury to his hand included a fractured left ring finger, which required surgery. However, bullet fragments remained in the hand and the victim was told that it would cause further damage to have it removed. He was in hospital for two days.  
     
      
    8 Obviously, the offences in the indictment related to the incident in Mr Sheath’s home. The firearm offence on the form 1 arose from the incident involving the witness, Mr Sinclair. 
     
      
    9 His Honour characterised the specially aggravated breaking and entering charge as premeditated, and expressed himself satisfied that the applicant entered the victim’s home to scare him and, if necessary, to cause him serious injury, so that he would not be able to give evidence the following day. His Honour noted that the weapon he carried was easy to conceal, that it was loaded, and that he took more than one bullet with him. While there was no evidence that the applicant knew that the victim’s son would be present, his Honour found that he must have contemplated that the child probably would be. He also observed that the presence of the child did not deter the applicant from carrying out his intention. 
     
      
    10 His Honour found that the applicant fired the second shot because it was apparent that the first shot had not achieved what he intended. He noted that both shots were fired at close range, and that the shot to the victim’s thigh area had the potential to cause serious injury, and even to be life threatening, because of the proximity of the wound to the femoral artery. In fact, his Honour found, the more serious injury was occasioned to the victim’s hand, for the reasons I have outlined. His Honour concluded that that injury was permanent. 
     
      
    11 Nevertheless, his Honour found that the injuries, while really serious, fell into the lower end of the range of those characterised as grievous bodily harm. On the other hand, he considered that the major offences were aggravated by the fact that they were committed in the victim’s home, and while his son was nearby. His Honour concluded that the criminality of both offences was towards the upper end of the range, although not falling within the worst class. As his Honour noted in reciting the facts, the offences were committed while the applicant was on bail in respect of the pending assault charge, and one of the conditions of his bail was that he not approach the victim’s premises.  
     
      
       
      Subjective case  
       
      
    12 The applicant was twenty-nine years old at the time of the offences and is now thirty-one. He has a criminal record, primarily for driving matters, some of them serious enough to have led to short prison terms. However, the only entry for violence is the assault on Mr Sheath, which was charged as assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was dealt with for that offence in September 2004 and sentenced to six months imprisonment. That sentence was subsumed within the sentences the subject of this application.  
     
      
    13 He had a supportive upbringing. However, he has an intellectual deficit, a matter to which I shall return. He left school in year 9, and thereafter worked with his father in a motor vehicle sales business. He was a good worker. 
     
      
    14 His relationship with Ms Mathews produced a son. The relationship is over, but she and the son have visited him in prison. He had a previous relationship of some years standing, which produced three children. In his later teenage years he was deeply affected by two tragedies, both of which he witnessed. When he was fifteen he saw his grandmother drown in the family swimming pool. He got her out of the pool but was unable to resuscitate her. About three years later his best friend was involved in a car accident. He was informed of the accident, rushed to the scene, and saw his friend die in the vehicle.  
     
      
    15 Before his Honour were a pre-sentence report and a psychological report, from which it appeared that the applicant had long suffered from dysthymia and elevated anxiety levels. There was also a history of alcohol and drug abuse, commencing after the death of his grandmother at a time when he was associating with inappropriate people of his age. However, to the probation officer and the psychologist he denied having been affected by alcohol or a drug at the time of the offences. In a handwritten statement to the court he described himself as “seriously affected by a drinking problem” at the time, saying that his “addled state” contributed to his “poor decision”. His Honour was uncertain what was meant to be conveyed by that part of the statement, but concluded that there was no credible evidence that he was affected either by liquor or drugs at the time he committed the offences.  
     
      
    16 As I have said, the respondent has an intellectual deficit, apparently of long standing. The psychologist obtained a history from him and from his parents. He displayed learning difficulties at school, and the psychologist placed him in the below average category of intellectual capacity. That assessment, together with other aspects of his personality, led her to conclude that he was an insecure person, prone to dependency in romantic relationships. In her report she wrote of him: 
     
      
       
        
        …it is of note that Sammy did not make friends easily and had a tendency to be quiet, shy and even anxious in his earlier years. Compounding this appears to have been the challenges he faced from his obvious learning difficulties and limited intellectual capacity, which seemed to have made him feel different from others and quite possibly caused him to become marginalised to some degree by his peers.  
        
       
      
    17 His Honour referred to this material in his remarks, accepting that the respondent was easily influenced by others, including partners, and that he liked to do things to secure the approval of friends and partners. His Honour found, however, that there was no acceptable evidence that anyone had influenced him to commit these offences. His Honour referred to the assessment of him as being below average intellectual capacity, but added that the evidence did not go so far as to establish that he suffered from intellectual disability.  
     
      
    18 He expressed remorse in the handwritten statement but, as he did not give evidence and could not be cross-examined about it, his Honour could not determine whether it was genuine. Nevertheless, his Honour found that there was a measure of contrition, albeit belated. He reduced the sentences he would otherwise have passed in recognition of the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty, although he did not quantify that reduction.  
     
      
    19 The respondent continued to enjoy the support of his family, and while in custody he had been working and seeking to address his problem of substance abuse. His Honour assessed his prospects of rehabilitation as reasonable and, as is apparent from the structure of the sentences, found special circumstances. 
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    20 In written submissions Mr Byrne SC, for the applicant, pointed out an error in the statement of facts which had been presented to his Honour. Those facts recorded that three cartridge cases had been found at the scene of the offences, suggesting that the applicant had fired the weapon three times. There is no doubt that this was an error, apparently arising from some confusion at the forensic ballistics laboratory between this case and another. However, it is clear from his Honour’s recitation of the facts that he sentenced him on the basis that the weapon was fired twice. No submission was made about the error in oral argument and nothing turns on it.  
     
      
    21 The thrust of the application was that his Honour fell into error in his approach to sentence in several respects, resulting in sentences which are manifestly excessive. It was put that he had erred in placing the offences towards the upper range of objective gravity, in failing to give adequate weight to the psychological material, and in his use of the standard non-parole period as a guide to the determination of the appropriate sentences.  
     
      
       
      Objective gravity  
       
      
    22 As to the objective gravity of the offence of specially aggravated break and enter, Mr Byrne acknowledged that it was premeditated but relied upon what he described as a finding by his Honour that the applicant’s “primary intention” was to scare the victim. In truth, as I have said, his Honour expressed himself satisfied that the applicant intended to scare the victim and, if necessary, to cause him serious injury. Consistent with that conclusion was his Honour’s finding that the applicant fired the second shot because the first had not achieved his purpose.  
     
      
    23 In any event, this was a particularly serious manifestation of the crime for which provision is made by s112(3) of the Crimes Act, that is specially aggravated breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing therein a serious indictable offence. The expression “serious indictable offence” embraces a wide variety of criminality and, obviously, the nature of the serious indictable offence alleged in a particular case will bear upon the gravity of the offence under the subsection.  
     
      
    24 In the present case the serious indictable offence was threatening to cause injury to a person to be called as a witness in judicial proceedings, intending to influence him not to attend court as a witness. That is an offence under s322 of the Crimes Act, which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for ten years. That maximum term reflects the significance which the community places upon a crime which strikes at the administration of justice. Given the facts as he recited them, and the circumstances as he found them, his Honour’s assessment of the gravity of the offence was clearly open to him.  
     
      
    25 As to the objective gravity of the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, Mr Byrne relied upon his Honour’s finding that the victim’s injuries fell into the lower end of the range of grievous bodily harm. He also noted that his Honour did not find that the applicant intended to inflict more serious injury. He referred to R v Amohanga & Rai (2005) 155 A Crim R 202. In that case the leading judgment was delivered by Simpson J, and in the course of it her Honour referred to other relevant decisions of this Court.  
     
      
    26 Amohanga & Rai were Crown appeals against sentences passed upon the respondents for armed robbery with the infliction of grievous bodily harm, an offence under s98 of the Crimes Act which also carries a maximum sentence of 25 years. The respondents committed the offence in somewhat sordid circumstances, and the victim was attacked ferociously with a tyre lever, causing very serious head injuries and leaving him with permanent disability. The appeals were allowed. Amohanga’s sentence was increased to imprisonment for twelve years with a non-parole period of eight-and-a-half years, and Rai’s to imprisonment for eleven years with a non-parole period of eight years.  
     
      
    27 Among the cases to which Simpson J referred were the related matters of R v El-Andouri [2004] NSWCCA 178 and R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172. Those two offenders were jointly involved in an offence under s98 of the Crimes Act, on this occasion robbery in company with the infliction of grievous bodily harm. In reviewing those cases, Simpson J noted at [103] that that offence was well planned and that the victim, a service station proprietor, was subjected to a vicious and brutal attack. Her Honour described him as having suffered “extremely severe and permanent injury”. El-Andouri had been sentenced to imprisonment for sixteen years with a non-parole period of nine years, and Fidow to imprisonment for eleven years with a non-parole period of eight years. Appeals by the two men against their sentences were dismissed. 
     
      
    28 In Amahonga & Rai Simpson J considered whether the respondents’ offences fell into the worst category of their kind. Her Honour said at [121], “As were the offences in El-Andouri and Fidow, these were among, or close to, the worst of their kind, if only by reason of the injuries occasioned to the victim”.  
     
      
    29 Her Honour also referred at [135]-[136] to the then recent decision of R v Duncan & Perre [2004] NSWCCA 431, a case of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. She noted that it also involved a brutal attack, causing the victim severe brain damage. Appeals against sentence by those offenders were successful, and in each case their sentences were reduced to imprisonment for thirteen years with a non-parole period of nine years. They had not pleaded guilty, but her Honour noted that they were juveniles at the time of the offence and ”had the benefit of considerably favourable subjective circumstances”.  
     
      
    30 Mr Byrne also referred to R v Kirkland [2005] NSWCCA 130 and R v Bobak [2005] NSWCCA 320, again related matters. Those two offenders had been sentenced for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, arising from an attack upon the victim with a hammer which left him with extremely serious injuries, having effects on his physical and mental capacity which the sentencing judge described as “profound, pervasive and permanent”. Bobak, whose role in the offence was greater than his co-offender, was sentenced to imprisonment for sixteen years with a non-parole period of twelve years, and Kirkland was sentenced to imprisonment for twelve years with a non-parole period of eight years. Appeals by both men against sentence were dismissed, the Court in each case adopting the sentencing judge’s characterisation of the offence as at the very upper end of the range of seriousness, while falling short of a worst case.  
     
      
    31 There is no doubt that the nature and effect of the victim’s injuries is an important matter in assessing the gravity of an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and, clearly, the injuries in all the cases referred to are much more severe than those in the present case. However, the seriousness of such an offence must be assessed on the basis not just of the injuries but of all the circumstances of the case.  
     
      
    32 The Crown prosecutor referred to Vragovic v R [2007] NSWCCA 46, a case of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent arising from an attack by the offender upon his former wife. He had broken into the home where she was living with a new partner, and had beaten her with a piece of exhaust pipe and a shortened firearm. The offence was premeditated, and was committed at a time when he was subject to an apprehended domestic violence order protecting her and her partner. He was found guilty after a trial, and an appeal against a sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years was dismissed. In delivering the leading judgment, Adams J referred to the circumstances of the offence and at [32], after noting that her injuries were “far from the most serious form of grievous bodily harm which might be suffered”, observed that the “objective gravity of the offence is not determined merely by considering the injuries”.  
     
      
    33 That observation is apposite in the present case. The offence involved the use of a firearm. As I have said, his Honour noted that, like the other principal offence, it was committed in the victim’s home while his son was nearby. It was well open to his Honour to have assessed the gravity of this offence also as he did.  
     
      
       
      Psychological report  
       
      
    34 Mr Byrne acknowledged that his Honour had referred to the psychological material in his remarks, but submitted that he had failed to give it the weight it deserved. From that material it appeared that the applicant’s assault on the victim, Mr Sheath arose from the strained relationship between the victim and Ms Mathews and, in particular, from disputes between those two about access to the children. The evidence conveyed, said Mr Byrne, that the applicant’s reduced intellectual capacity and dependant personality meant that he did not have the maturity to deal with the situation.  
     
      
    35 That may well afford some explanation for the assault but, of course, that offence is no more than the background to the serious offences with which this Court is dealing. The psychological material provides nothing in mitigation of those offences. Indeed, as I have said, his Honour found that the applicant was not influenced by anyone to commit them and that they were not the product of his need to secure the approval of others.  
     
      
    36 As I have also said, his Honour found that the applicant’s below average intellectual capacity fell short of intellectual disability. Presumably, that observation amounted to a finding that the case was not one affected by the special considerations governing the sentencing of persons who are mentally ill or intellectually disabled reviewed in cases such as R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. Clearly, that was so.  
     
      
       
      Standard non-parole period 
        
       
      
    37 His Honour expressed himself to have determined the appropriate sentence for each offence in the light of the prescribed maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period, guided by the decision of this Court in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. As I have said, the standard non-parole period for each of the principal offences was seven years and for each offence the sentence imposed was imprisonment for fifteen years with a non-parole period of ten-and-a-half years. Mr Byrne submitted that, in the light of the applicant’s pleas of guilty, a non-parole period which represented an increment of the standard non-parole period by fifty per cent was manifestly excessive (as was the head sentence associated with it). He argued that such a marked increase of the standard non-parole period demonstrates that his Honour did not adopt the approach endorsed in Way and a series of subsequent decisions of this Court which followed it.  
     
      
    38 As to the offence of specially aggravated break and enter, I have already referred to the broad range of criminality encompassed by the term “serious indictable offence” in s112 of the Crimes Act. No doubt, it is for that reason that a relatively moderate standard non-parole period is prescribed for specially aggravated offences under s112(3). The serious indictable offence in the present case, as I have said, is one of particular gravity. In all the circumstances, his Honour was justified in fixing a non-parole period significantly higher than the standard non-parole period, notwithstanding the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    39 The same non-parole period for the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, after a plea of guilty, is undoubtedly high. However, in the light of all the circumstances which I have outlined, I cannot say that it was outside the bounds of his Honour’s discretion. Moreover, the fact that the sentence for that offence is wholly concurrent with the other sentence cannot be ignored.  
     
      
       
      Manifestly excessive? 
       
      
    40 Allied to Mr Byrne’s argument about the non-parole periods was his submission that the sentences are, in any event, manifestly excessive. As to the sentence for the grievous bodily harm charge, he relied on the other cases to which I have earlier referred. He noted that the only two cases in which sentences higher than the applicant’s had been passed were El-Andouri and Bobak, in both of which sentences of sixteen years were upheld (although in El-Andouri’s case the non-parole period was lower than that of the applicant, nine years). Otherwise the sentences ranged between eleven and thirteen years. To those cases should be added McArthur v R [2006] NSWCCA 200, in which the Court upheld a sentence of twelve years with a non-parole period of nine years for an offence of armed robbery with the infliction of grievous bodily harm, in which the victim had suffered injuries which the sentencing judge described as ”catastrophic”. In all of these cases except Duncan & Perre, there had been pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    41 The sentences passed on this applicant were severe but, given the gravity of the circumstances surrounding them, appropriately so. Such pattern as emerges from the cases involving grievous bodily harm referred to does not demonstrate that the sentence for the grievous bodily harm charge in the present case is manifestly excessive. As I have said, the applicant has the benefit of complete concurrence of the sentences on the two principal charges, in a case where it would have been open to his Honour to have accumulated partially. Moreover, the criminality of the offence on the form 1 had to be reflected, and all the offences were committed while the applicant was subject to conditional liberty of particular significance, that is, bail which prohibited him from approaching the victim’s home. 
     
      
    42 Before parting with the matter, however, I should add this. The fact that his Honour passed the same sentences, to be served concurrently, for both of the principal offences suggests that he may have had an eye only to the aggregate sentence, without considering the appropriate sentence for each charge in accordance with the principles enunciated in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. One might have thought that a distinction in sentence was called for, given the different nature of the criminality of the two offences and, particularly, the fact that the form 1 matter was taken into account in sentencing for the aggravated break and enter offence. However, this point was not taken in the application. In any event, as the sentence for the aggravated break and enter is to stand, any adjustment of the sentence for the grievous bodily harm offence would be of no practical effect. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    43 I am not persuaded that any of the challenges to the sentences has been made good. I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    44 ROTHMAN J: I agree with Hidden J.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Sometimes judges come across crimes of such heinousness that they are accurately described as chilling. Some of the crimes for which this offender is to be sentenced easily fall into that category. They involve the systematic abuse and even torture of a young man by this offender and other callous individuals. 2 I will describe those offences later in these remarks but before I do, it is important to note that the offender stands to be sentenced in relation to a number of completely separate episodes of criminality.3 On 20 July 2005 the offender committed the offence of receiving in circumstances where his associates robbed a young man whilst he was at the Mt Druitt Railway Station. The offender saw this occur and afterwards received the victim’s wallet and mobile telephone. This offence appears on a Form 1 to be taken into account when sentencing the offender for one of a group of offences he later committed on 13 September 2005. 4 However in between the offence of 20 July 2005 and the offences of 13 September 2005 the offender committed a number of atrocious crimes on a young man by the name of DS. As I said when sentencing one of the offender’s co-offenders “the relevant events all occurred in the one episode of criminality. It was a period of disgraceful criminality. It involved the abuse of a young man for nothing more than the malicious, gratuitous and cruel enjoyment of a number of people. The young man was abused and treated as inhuman with no thought being given to his welfare by those involved.”5 As I describe what happened that evening it will become clear why I said what I said. 6 On the evening of 2 August 2005 DS, then aged sixteen, met up with a number of young people including this offender, who was the oldest of the group. Things appear to have begun amicably and DS was invited to go with the group of young people in order to drink some alcohol. They bought some beer and went back to a home unit in Mt Druitt. After a while there, without any explanation at all, this offender turned what was an amicable occasion into something quite different. 7 DS was sitting on a kitchen chair in the lounge room area. Without any warning at all the offender became aggressive, got up, approached the complainant, and punched him to the face with a closed fist. The complainant fell to the floor. He got up but was pushed down again. The offender continued to physically assault the complainant by kicking and punching into him. These events form the basis of Count 1 on the first indictment - an offence of malicious wounding. 8 Not surprisingly this turn of events upset the complainant. A youth whom I will call LK, then aged fourteen, joined in the assault, punching and kicking the complainant while he was on the ground - an offence of malicious wounding whilst in company. 9 It is clear that the complainant suffered serious injuries. Tendered to me were a series of photographs of the complainant revealing lacerations to his face which required stitches, a cut to his eyebrow which required medical glue, two black eyes, a swollen nose, a swollen face and many other smaller lacerations. 10 A little while later the complainant sat back on the chair. He was told to keep his mouth shut, but far from things calming down, they escalated. The offender said to the complainant “I am going to kill you” and LK told him to move to the lounge chair. The complainant asked to leave but the offender, and others, would not allow this to happen. This is the beginning of a period of detention, that period forming the basis of Count 3 on the indictment, a very serious offence of detaining DS without his consent with intent to gain an advantage, namely sexual gratification and immediately before detaining him causing him actual bodily harm.11 An older woman, Ms Shirley Dyer, who was present in the home unit also asked that the complainant be allowed to leave but the offender was one of those who refused to allow that to happen. 12 LK then went and got a knife and fork from the kitchen. He began to stab the complainant to various parts of his body. The offender then decided to join in as well but he was armed with a pair of scissors. He stabbed the complainant to his head, the leg and his hand. He also, to add insult to injury, spat on the complainant who, in an effort to defend himself, put his hands up. As a result he was stabbed in the palm and webbing of his hands by the offender. This forms the basis of Count 2 on the indictment namely an offence of maliciously wounding DS.13 Physical trauma was not the only injury suffered by the complainant that evening, because at this time the offender and LK said again that they were going to kill the complainant. Not surprisingly the statement of facts records that at this stage “the complainant became paralysed with fear, too scared to move”. 14 The complainant then began to beg to be set free. Rather than feeling any compassion towards this terrified and injured young man, the offender said “Suck my penis and then we will let you go”. DS was then made to kiss the exposed penis of the offender, - this forming the basis of Count 4 on the indictment, an offence of inciting DS to commit an act of indecency at the time DS being sixteen years of age. He was also forced to perform acts of indecency on Gavin and Jessica McGaw, two offenders whom I earlier sentenced. Those offences appear on the Form 1.15 Could matters get any worse? - Unfortunately they could and they did. The complainant was made to take down his pants and underpants and bend over a two-seater lounge. LK got a wooden rolling pin and some cream, he squirted the cream into the hands of the complainant telling him to rub it between the cheeks of his bottom. The complainant did what he was told, LK then hit the complainant about three times to the head with the rolling pin before forcing it into the complainant’s anus. Indeed he used the sole of his shoed foot to force the rolling pin further into the complainant’s anus. This caused the complainant great pain. He was screaming out and begging LK to stop. These events form the basis of Count 5 on the indictment, an offence that the offender whilst in the company of others had sexual intercourse with DS without his consent knowing that he was not consenting and immediately before the sexual intercourse maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm upon him.16 The offender then took over from LK and he began forcing the rolling pin into the complainant’s anus. The offender’s use of the rolling pin forms the basis of Count 6 on the indictment, it being the count on the indictment that has the matters on the Form 1 attached to it. It is an offence of whilst in the company of another having sexual intercourse with DS without his consent knowing that he was not consenting and immediately before that maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm upon him.17 Throughout these events DS was asking to be allowed to leave and for the assaults to stop. Eventually the offender and LK stopped abusing him with the rolling pin. DS turned around and saw it on the ground covered in blood. The group began to discuss what to do with the complainant. Gavin McGaw wanted to let him go but the offender told Mr McGaw that if they let him go the complainant would go to the police. This led to a fight between the offender and Mr McGaw over whether the complainant should be allowed to leave.18 At about 2am LK took the complainant to the rear yard of the premises. The complainant thought that he was going to die but took advantage of LK’s decision to urinate to leap over the back fence. He came across a resident who contacted police. He was taken by ambulance to Nepean Hospital where his injuries were observed and treated. Those injuries are set out in a statement of facts. It is apparent that he was injured to many parts of his body.19 The offender told a friend of his what he had done a few weeks later and was arrested on 13 September after committing the further offences which I will now describe.20 At about 11.45pm on 13 September 2005 a man by the name of Agacan Surmeli returned home. He had some compact discs and money inside a clear plastic bag. He was collecting groceries from his car when he saw a group of young men walking towards him. The offender approached Mr Surmeli and said “Give us your money you cunt” and adopted a fighting stance. Other members of the offender’s group were nearby. Mr Surmeli removed a baton from his car and waved it around to protect himself. The offender and another person then assaulted Mr Surmali - these events forming the basis of Count 1 on the second indictment. Mr Surmeli lunged at the group with his baton and they ran away. Mr Surmeli tried to throw the bag that he was holding to a location where the offender and his friends could not get to it but he failed to do so. 21 He chased the four men, one fell over and another stood with his hands up saying “Cool down”. Mr Surmeli said “Take your mates and go” but at this stage the offender’s brother yelled “Let’s get him” so the offender pulled out a “For Sale” sign out of the ground and removed the sign. He then ran at Mr Surmeli brandishing the pole. This forms the basis of Count 2 on the second indictment - an offence of using an offensive weapon to assault Mr Surmeli. 22 Mr Surmeli ran to his block of units, got inside and locked the front door. He was able to observe what happened after that from his balcony. The offender walked over to where Mr Surmeli’s bag containing the CDs and money had fallen. The offender placed those items under his t-shirt and walked away. That is the offence of larceny, the third Count on the indictment. As a parting gesture the offender shouted at Mr Surmeli not to call the police or he would kill him, but the offender was arrested soon afterwards.23 The crimes committed by the offender on 13 September 2005 were not admitted by the offender. He stood trial before his Honour the late Judge Viney and a jury and was convicted. The factual basis on which I am to sentence the offender was agreed and was contained in a document headed “Crown Summary of Case on Sentence” from which I have extracted some of the information above.24 To summarise the offences which the offender is to be sentenced today.25 There is one count of malicious wounding with a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment; one count of malicious wounding in company with a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment; one count of specially aggravated kidnapping with a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment; two counts of aggravated sexual assault in company for which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of fifteen years imprisonment (one of those offences carrying matters on a Form 1); one count of assault with intent to rob whilst in company carrying a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment (this offence also carrying a matter on a Form 1); one count of using an offensive weapon to commit a serious indictable offence in company, carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of fifteen years; and finally there is an offence of larceny for which the maximum penalty is five years imprisonment.26 The seriousness of the offences as described by me, the maximum penalties, the fact that there is a very lengthy standard non-parole period attached to two of the offences for which the offender is to be sentenced, and the fact that all of these offences were committed whilst the offender was on parole, all suggest that it is inevitable that the offender will serve a very lengthy period of imprisonment.27 He is now twenty-three years of age. He is of Aboriginal background being the youngest of ten siblings. His parents separated when he was about twelve years of age after which he began associating with the wrong crowd, truanting from school and using alcohol. Initially the offender lived with his father after his parents divorced but then essentially became a street kid between the ages of thirteen and sixteen. His mother had a severe drug and alcohol problem which got worse after she divorced the offender’s father. At the age of sixteen the offender was incarcerated. During that time he completed his School Certificate and did other courses. After release from custody he came under the influence of his old friends and started to consume alcohol to excess.28 His criminal history includes serious earlier offending. He was released from juvenile detention in August 2004. He committed other offences apart from these whilst on parole and was put on a good behaviour bond. He failed to report to the Probation & Parole Service for supervision but before breach action could be taken against him he was arrested for the matters for which he is to be sentenced today.29 The offender was drinking heavily at the time of these offences. On 2 August he said that he had drunk half a bottle of vodka and fifteen beers and that around this time was drinking on a daily basis. He expressed his remorse by saying that he was sorry for DS and ashamed of what he did and that he now recognises his need to get counselling for his alcohol abuse. He says that he has not commenced counselling whilst in custody because of Court matters. 30 I mentioned before that the offences of aggravated sexual assault in company have a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with standard non-parole periods of fifteen years. Of course the standard non-parole period does not have direct application in this case, because of the pleas of guilty to those offences, but it remains as a guide post in assessing the appropriate sentences. 31 It is important that I assess the level of objective criminality and decide where in relation to the mid range these particular offences fall. I am satisfied that the circumstances of these offences are such that they are objectively worse than the mid range, indeed this was conceded by counsel who appeared for the offender, particularly so in the case of Count 6: the complainant’s anus was forcefully and persistently penetrated with a rolling pin, causing him physical injuries as well as great pain in circumstances where he had already been assaulted and believed he was going to die. Indeed these circumstances suggest that, objectively, the offences are approaching the worst case. 32 It is correct to say that the offences committed by the offender, particularly those involving the sexual assault of the complainant, involved gratuitous cruelty. And it is a matter of serious aggravation also that all the offences for which the offender is to be dealt were committed whilst he was on parole and also on a bond for an offence of violence. 33 It was submitted on behalf of the offender that whilst he was more culpable than two others whom I earlier sentenced, Gavin McGaw and Jessica McGaw, he was less culpable than LK, he being the person who obtained the rolling pin for use in the sexual assault of DS. 34 I reject the submission that this offender was less culpable than LK. It has to be remembered that it was this offender who took the decision to commence acting violently towards the complainant, turning what appears to have been a friendly experience to the complainant into a terrifying one. I regard LK and this offender as equally culpable upon the material before me.35 It will be noted that I have thus far concentrated on the events of 2 August 2005 and have barely mentioned the other offences the offender committed about six weeks later. Those later offences were also serious involving violence, the use of weapons, and the unlawful taking of another’s property. It should not be thought that I have overlooked these offences at all, but serious as they are, their criminality pales in comparison to the awful offences committed on the young man six weeks later. 36 Perhaps the most significant mitigating factors which counsel for the offender relied on concerned his youth and his offer of assistance to the authorities. 37 The offender was born in August 1984 and so these offences were committed either side of his 21st birthday. Counsel for the offender suggested that I should not sentence him as though he were a fully-grown adult. I recognise that the offender was still an immature man, but I do have to say that it does not take much maturity to know how morally repugnant it is to treat a young man the way the complainant was treated on 2 August 2005 and it does not take much maturity to know that it is wrong to rob someone and attack them with a wooden pole.38 Perhaps the most significant aspects of the offender’s youth concerns its relationship with his excessive drinking. As counsel submitted, the offender has been off the rails since he was sixteen in circumstances where he drank enormous quantities of alcohol. The offender suggested that he had indeed consumed a lot of alcohol before committing the offences of 2 August 2005. Perhaps therefore the most importance of the offender’s youth is because of its indirect relationship to the offences, in the sense that the offender’s immaturity was a factor in leading to his heavy drinking and there is the possibility that this in turn may have led him to act in ways he would not have acted if sober. 39 The offender has undertaken to assist the authorities. I note that that assistance includes an undertaking to give evidence for the prosecution. The authorities assessed the information provided by the offender, and the evidence he is prepared to give, as being accurate, although it could not be said that it was provided early.40 I will not quantify the discount for assistance separately from the discount for pleading guilty to the offences of 2 August 2005, but will indicate that because of the late plea of guilty to those offences and the assistance the sentences for those offences are about one-third less than they otherwise would have been. I have also taken the assistance into account in deciding on the sentences for the offences to which pleas of guilty were not entered. 41 I note that I am encouraged by decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal to quantify the discount for future assistance, encouragement which is consistent with s 21A of the Commonwealth Crimes Act which applies in Commonwealth matters. I myself doubt the utility of such quantification given the large number of cases where undertakings to give evidence are given and the comparatively small number of appeals under s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act. It seems to me that unnecessarily splitting up the discount between on the one hand future assistance and the other hand the plea of guilty and past assistance can only lead to a pretence of precision in sentencing which is wholly unwarranted. But in the light of the Court of Criminal Appeal authorities I will indicate that the discount for future assistance is fifteen percent. 42 The question of totality is clearly important here. I have to give the offender an overall sentence which is appropriate to his overall situation. For this reason there will need to be a significant component of concurrence in the sentences I impose. 43 It was submitted to me that I would find special circumstances, these mainly relating to the youth of the offender. Of course I have to be careful not to double count here. I have already decided to impose a lower sentence on the offender because of his youth and it would be double counting to then automatically reduce the non-parole period because of the same factor. The length of the overall sentence is such that there must necessarily be a lengthy period of eligibility for parole even in the absence of a finding of special circumstances. Although the individual sentences will not reflect the statutory ratio, in the circumstances as I have explained them, the overall sentence will. 44 Before I impose sentence I remind those present that there should be no publication of either DS’s name or any information tending to identify him. I impose the following sentences:45 For the offences of 13 September 2005 - 
     
     On Count 1 taking into account the matter on the Form 1, I impose a fixed term of imprisonment for three years commencing 13 September 2005. 
     
     
     On Count 2 I impose a fixed term of imprisonment for two years commencing 13 September 2005; and 
     
     
     On Count 3 I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of six months commencing 13 September 2005. 
    46 Now dealing with the offences of 2 August 2005 -  
     
     On Count 1 I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of two years commencing 13 September 2007; 
     
     
     On Count 2 I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of three years commencing 13 September 2007; 
     
     
     On Count 3 I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of four years commencing 13 September 2007;  
     
     
     On Count 4 I impose a fixed term of one year commencing 13 September 2007. 
    47 All of the sentences I have thus far mentioned are fixed terms because of the next two sentences I will impose -  
     
     On Count 5 I set a non-parole period of six years and head sentence of nine years commencing 13 September 2007; and  
     
     
     On Count 6 taking into account the matters on the Form 1, I set a non-parole period of eight and a half years with a total sentence of twelve years commencing 13 September 2007. 
    48 Thus the overall sentence will be one of fourteen years with an affective non-parole period of ten and a half years expiring on 12 March 2016 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

     Judgment 
      
      
      
    1 MASON P: On 1 September 2003 the appellant was indicted in the District Court on a charge of wounding with intent to murder, alternatively malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Having pleaded not guilty he was tried before Ducker ADCJ and a jury. On 8 September 2003 the jury found him not guilty on the primary count, but guilty on the alternative count. 
     
      
    2 On 25 November 2003 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 11 years commencing on 22 July 2002 with a non-parole period of eight years and three months. An appeal against sentence was heard and dismissed on 31 January 2005 (Regina v O'Connor [2005] NSWCCA 5). 
     
      
    3 This appeal was commenced by filing of a Notice of Appeal on 2 May 2007. I shall say something below about the circumstances in which an application for leave to appeal against sentence with its ensuing appeal was heard and determined over two years before the present appeal against conviction was instituted. 
     
      
    4 The charges arose out of an incident in July 2002 in the flat occupied by a young man named Stephen Maher. Two friends, Guy Murdoch and the victim, Mark Whittaker, were all significantly intoxicated by alcohol when they returned to the flat. The appellant, who knew Maher and Murdoch (but not the victim), was waiting to see them when they returned. He too had been drinking. All four men went inside and began to drink more alcohol. 
     
      
    5 The appellant began to behave aggressively, particularly towards the victim. He also threatened and pushed Maher, who decamped by jumping off the veranda.  
     
      
    6 The victim said that the men were sitting drinking when the appellant started getting aggressive, asking repeatedly: ""what are you looking at?"" After Maher and Murdoch ran out of the premises the appellant kicked the victim in the right eye and smashed a large ashtray across his head causing it to break. The appellant then used a large jagged section of the ashtray to make a ferocious attack around the victim's temple. At one stage the appellant was squeezing the victim's throat while trying to cut him with the jagged section of the ashtray. The victim managed to escape, bleeding profusely and leaving behind his jumper and T-shirt. There was medical and photographic evidence establishing that the victim suffered severe lacerations to the head and face as well as to the hand, shoulder and upper arm. A doctor described the wounds as ""quite deep"". He said that the joint and/or bone was on view on the shoulder and that the arm wound was down to and into the muscle of the limb. 
     
      
    7 Murdoch witnessed the appellant becoming aggressive. He saw him grab the victim by the throat and threaten him, but left the flat before the fight. 
     
      
    8 Maher said that he had been drinking with the victim at various locations. He was present when the appellant started to become aggressive and make threats. He tried to settle the appellant down and was pushed by him into his bedroom. He then ran away through the verandah because he was scared. that, as he was leaving, he could hear ""punching and stuff going on"". He expressed the view that the appellant did not appear himself to be drunk. 
     
      
    9 The appellant gave evidence that he was taking Temazepam to help him sleep and that his doctor had told him that he should not drink whilst on this medication. Notwithstanding, he started drinking at about midday on the day in question. His version of the incident was that the group of men arrived at the flat where he was sitting on the steps, hoping to be able to stay the night. He was introduced to the victim. Beer was consumed inside the flat. According to him, Murdoch (""Guyser"") left suddenly and without explanation. He was confused as to why this happened. He heard his name being called by Maher (""Stevie""). Then he turned around to find the victim standing right in front of him. He felt threatened and confused. The victim had a bottle in one hand and his hands were raised. The appellant grabbed him by the front of his shirt and knocked away the hand holding the beer. There was a scuffle and wrestling. The victim's hands were around his face and neck. He was kicked in the testicles. He flipped the victim onto his back and in the course of doing so, turned the coffee table upside down. He denied hitting the victim with the ashtray at any time. He denied threatening to kill or saying anything like that. In cross-examination, he was challenged about whether he really had taken Temazepam at that stage in the evening. He denied any knowledge or intent with regard to the broken ashtray being put in the bin where it was found by the police. 
     
      
    10 The substantive issues raised at the trial were whether the jury were satisfied that the appellant acted with one or other of the specific intents charged in the two alternative counts; and the issue of self defence without use of excessive force. The jury were given directions as to intoxication (of which more later). 
     
      
    11 The appellant represented himself in the appeal and relied principally upon written submissions that raised 10 grounds of appeal. None of the grounds succeed and several of them are completely misconceived. 
     
      
      Ground 1: Trial unfair because the Crown failed to provide the entire brief of evidence prior to the trial 
       
      
    12 This complaint relates to the fact that the appellant had to issue a subpoena to gain access to certain documents from the Crown. His counsel at trial made no complaint suggesting that these ought to have been in the brief. The documents were produced and inspected and the trial proceeded without concern on this matter.  
     
      
    13 There was no miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Failure to prove intent to cause grievous bodily harm 
       
      
    14 The appellant rightly submits that the prosecution had to prove this specific intent as regards the second count. He is wrong in asserting that this did not occur. The nature and extent of the serious wounds inflicted on the victim were eloquent of the requisite intent. The medical evidence demonstrated that the wounds were many and deep. Furthermore, the assaults were preceded with the appellant telling the victim, according to the latter's evidence: ""You're dead. You're gone"".  
     
      
    15 The judge had directed the jury about the need to be satisfied to the requisite standard about intent to cause really serious bodily harm and the subjective nature of their inquiry. Nothing implied that they could reason simply from the ""natural and probable consequences of the acts"", as suggested by the appellant.  
     
      
    16 This ground is not made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: Failure to prove capacity to form the intent despite intoxication 
       
      
    17 The appellant’s evidence about his drinking and the taking of Temazapam is set out above. No expert evidence was led about the possible impact of this cocktail.18 Following a jury question about Temazapam, the appellant was granted leave to reopen his case to allow the tender of an agreed extract from MIMS about the drug's properties. The material was tendered on the basis that the prosecution did not accept its relevance on the facts of the case, in light of the appellant’s own evidence that he was fully aware of what he was doing (see Tr 4/9/03 pp254-5 and Tr 5/9/03 pp15-16). 
     
      
    19 Directions were given in the summing up, without complaint at trial, about the need for the jury to be satisfied that the appellant formed the requisite intent. At the request of the appellant’s counsel, the judge redirected on the issue of intoxication. The jury were told that they were entitled to take the question of the degree of intoxication into account on the question whether the accused formed the requisite intent. 
     
      
    20 In my view, it was well open to the jury to find that intention to inflict grievous bodily harm had been proved. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: Error in permitting police officer to read his statement as evidence in chief 
       
      
    21 Without objection, a police witness gave evidence in chief by reading a statement he had made five days after the event. The appellant does not suggest that his trial miscarried on this account. He merely submits that this method of giving testimony was not the same as referring to or refreshing memory from contemporaneous notes. What occurred was permitted by s33 of the Evidence Act 1995. This ground is without merit. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: Misdirection by reference to ""drunkenness"" rather than ""intoxication"" 
       
      
    22 Very early in the trial (Tr 1/9/03 p15) the judge told the jury that: 
     
      
       
        
        Drunkenness is not per se, that is, of itself, a defence to a criminal charge, but in both of these charges, not one, as I told you before, but in both these charges there is involved what is known in law as a special intent and the consumption of alcohol and the effects coming therefrom is a matter which a jury will need to consider when determining whether the accused had the requisite intent in both charges. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    23 The appellant complains that the judge should not have used the word drunkenness as distinct from intoxication.  
     
      
    24 During the summing up on Friday 5 September 2003 the prosecutor reminded the judge of s428G of the Crimes Act 1900. The following ensued in the presence of the jury (SU Tr 5/9/03 pp16-17): 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes there has been a relatively recent amendment members of the jury which sometimes old judges do not keep up. What is said is correct that drunkenness does not apply as to the question as to whether or not the act of the accused was voluntary. As long as he inflicted the wound is enough. But it does apply to the question of intent. 
        
       
       
        
        POLAK: In relation to that your Honour, it is intoxication not drunkenness. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well intoxication yes. 
        
       
       
        
        POLAK: They are not interchangeable concepts. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No intoxication may be. Just to make sure the jury clearly understands the situation. When it comes to deciding whether the accused’s act in causing the wound was deliberate, then intoxication does not come into it. In deciding whether he had the specific intent to murder or on the second count the specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm, then it is something that has to be considered on the question as to whether he did in fact form that intent. Anything else? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour thank you. 
        
       
       
        
        POLAK: No your Honour, thanks. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    25 On Monday 8 September 2003 counsel for the appellant sought and obtained a further direction in relation to intoxication (SU Tr 8/9/03 pp53. 58-9). 
     
      
    26 The appellant does not indicate in his submissions why the ultimately corrected slip eliding “drunkenness” and “intoxication” might have caused some miscarriage. None occurred. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6: Error in delayed raising of alternative verdict of malicious wounding 
       
      
    27 During the summing up on 8 September 2004 counsel for the appellant asked the judge to inform the jury that they could, in the alternative, find a verdict of malicious wounding (see Crimes Act, s34). The Crown prosecutor agreed and the jury was directed accordingly (SU Tr 8/9/03 pp57-8). 
     
      
    28 In the absence of this matter having been raised earlier by counsel for the appellant, it was not incumbent on the judge to have informed the jury earlier. Appropriate directions were given at the appropriate time. 
     
      
    29 This point has no substance. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7: Error in directing the jury that a verdict of not guilty was not a finding of innocence 
       
      
    30 In the course of directing the jury that the onus of proof remained upon the prosecution throughout, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        The fact that the accused gave evidence in this case does not change that. He was under no onus to prove anything in the case, least of all his own innocence. Criminal trials are not about the proof of innocence, they are about the proof beyond reasonable doubt of guilt. A verdict of not guilty is not a finding of innocence, it is merely a finding by the jury that having considered the whole of the evidence it could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime. All accused persons for the purposes of their trial are presumed to be innocent of the offence until such time as the prosecution can produce evidence which persuades the jury that the accused in fact did commit the offence. 
        
       
       
      
    31 The appellant submits that this direction inferred that there was some degree of guilt simply because the charge had been laid and there was a trial. This submission is entirely lacking in substance. The direction contained no such inference. Neither had it been the subject of complaint at trial. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8: Error in admitting hearsay evidence of a conversation with Mr Maher 
       
      
    32 Mr Maher gave evidence, over objection, about a conversation with the victim whom he visited in hospital. This took place on the morning after the incident at the flat. According to Maher, Mr Whittaker told him that after he (Maher) had left, the accused had bashed him with the big blue ashtray. The assault had come to an end when Whittaker dropped to the ground, the accused stopped and Whittaker “got up and put the knee in”. 
     
      
    33 The judge ruled that the evidence was admissible pursuant to s66 of the Evidence Act on the basis that Maher was giving evidence about what he heard at a time when the occurrence of the fact asserted in the representation was fresh in the memory of the victim. Alternatively the evidence was ruled admissible under s108(3). An issue had been raised as to the credit of the complainant by putting to him the suggestion that his version of how the injuries were sustained was untrue. Leave was granted to adduce the evidence from Maher on the basis that it was a prior consistent statement from Mr Whittaker. 
     
      
    34 The appellant does not develop his argument as to why the hearsay evidence was inadmissible. In my opinion it was, on either of the two bases referred to.35 It is submitted in the alternative that the judge should have given directions and warnings to the jury in relation to this matter. None were sought. I perceive no miscarriage in this regard. The jury were entitled to have regard to this probative evidence of an unprompted assertion by the alleged victim not long after the events in question that was consistent with his sworn testimony. 
     
      
       
      Ground 9: Error in telling the jury that they should ask for further assistance if they required any further directions 
       
      
    36 This ground has no merit. 
     
      
       
      Ground 10: Verdict unreasonable and unable to be supported, having regard to the evidence 
       
      
    37 The question for this Court is whether it considers that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. The Court must consider the totality of the evidence, recognising that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt and that the jury had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. 
     
      
    38 In my view it was well open to the jury to find guilt having regard to the evidence summarised above, in particular, the evidence of the victim and the severe injuries that he suffered. 
     
      
    39 The appellant submits that there were serious inconsistencies in the evidence of the witnesses and that this was recognised by the trial judge who arranged for the whole transcript to be provided to the jury “so comparisons can be made of the evidence given”. The only matters developed by the appellant concern irrelevant discrepancies about matters of timing and the fact (commented on during sentence) the victim’s friend decamped, leaving him to be bashed. These were not central to a case that rested primarily upon the evidence of the victim corroborated as it was by the medical evidence. The fact that Maher and Murdoch left the premises is of no moment to the issue of what happened in their absence. 
     
      
    40 The appellant next points to the absence of evidence to establish that the blood on the blue ashtray was that of the victim. During the proceedings after conviction the trial judge indicated that he was appalled by the failure to analyse the blood that was found on the weapon. In latching onto this comment, the appellant misunderstands that the judge was expressing a forceful view about police procedure. If the police had caused the blood on the ashtray to be analysed and found it to be the victim’s then this may have destroyed the defence case. But such evidence was not an essential part of the Crown case. It was common ground that there was a struggle between the appellant and victim. An agreed statement of facts (Exhibit L) indicated that it was common ground that blood with the same DNA profile as that of the victim was found on the appellant’s left shoe. 
     
      
    41 Mr Whittaker was seriously injured. The issue was whether the Crown could prove that the appellant had acted deliberately, with the necessary intent, and not by way of self-defence. The medical evidence was that some of the injuries to the victim were inconsistent with the accident as recounted by the appellant in his evidence, but consistent with the slashing that the victim deposed to. 
     
      
    42 There was no evidence that the appellant bled at the scene. The inescapable inference that it was the victim’s blood on the ashtray was capable of being drawn without a scientific analysis. 
     
      
    43 Next it is submitted that there was no evidence linking the appellant to the alleged weapon. The point appears to be that there were no forensic or DNA tests in this regard. There was however the evidence of the victim which, if accepted, established beyond doubt that the appellant had used the ashtray as a weapon. A similar riposte may be offered with regard to the appellant’s submission that there was no evidence of the appellant’s fingerprints at the scene.44 Finally, the appellant submits that there was no evidence such as evidence of a thumb mark relating to bruising on the neck or throat consistent with the victim’s evidence of the fight. 
     
      
    45 Dr White had been shown photographs of the victim taken five days after the incident. He conceded that there was no distinct thumb mark depicted in those photographs. He also accepted that nobody in the medical notes had noted any neck injuries or thumb prints on the neck. 
     
      
    46 As the Crown submits, when the victim presented at the hospital he had severe injuries and had apparently lost a great deal of blood. The jury could well have come to the view that there was an attempt at strangulation but that the medical staff failed to see any evidence of it. 
     
      
    47 This particular gap in the Crown case does not mean that it ceased to be open to the jury, acting reasonably, to find the offence proved. 
     
      
    48 Accordingly, each ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    49 The appellant requires an order extending time in relation to the Notice of Appeal challenging the conviction (Criminal Appeal Rules, r3B). 
     
      
    50 In order to dispose of the matter finally I would grant the extension of time but dismiss the appeal, for the reasons stated above. 
     
      
       
      A procedural nightmare 
       
      
    51 The jury rendered their verdict on 8 September 2003. Sentencing took place on 25 November 2003. 
     
      
    52 On 1 December 2003 the appellant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal specifying his intention to challenge both conviction and sentence. This notice was extended at the request of the Legal Aid Commission but expired on 3 November 2004 (Criminal Appeal Rules, r3A). 
     
      
    53 The following information has been obtained from the records of the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
     
      
    54 “Grounds of Appeal” relating to sentence were filed on behalf of the appellant by the Legal Aid Commission on 30 July 2004.  
     
      
    55 On 30 July 2004 submissions were filed in the “Severity Appeal”, prepared and signed by counsel. 
     
      
    56 The matter was mentioned on 16 August 2004, when the Registrar was told that there was an outstanding appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee. It may be inferred that this appeal related to the appellant’s failure to obtain legal aid to challenge the conviction.  
     
      
    57 On 13 September 2004 the matter was fixed for hearing as a sentence appeal. 
     
      
    58 The appeal against sentence was heard and determined on 31 January 2005. A court comprising Sully J and Kirby J granted leave to appeal against sentence but dismissed the appeal (see Regina v O’Connor [2005] NSWCCA 5). 
     
      
    59 On 15 March 2006 the appellant wrote to the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal complaining that his counsel had failed to raise certain matters at the sentencing appeal. The appellant also asked why he had not heard anything in relation to his appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    60 The Registrar responded on 20 March 2006 advising that the appellant would need to seek an extension of time to appeal against conviction. Nothing further was heard until the appellant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal on 20 July 2006. This was extended in January 2007, to expire on 4 May 2007. 
     
      
    61 Appeal documents relating to conviction were received in the registry on 1 May 2007. They did not include a Notice of Appeal. Such a Notice was sought and received on 2 May 2007. The appeal documents include a covering letter and an affidavit seeking to explain the appellant’s delay. The affidavit states that the appellant never wished to abandon his right to appeal against the conviction. The delay in prosecuting that appeal is said to stem from his lack of legal training and difficulties experienced in relation to preparing requisite documents. 
     
      
    62 This is the third occasion in which I have sat on the Court of Criminal Appeal in a similar situation. An appeal against sentence was listed, heard and determined by a particular bench only to be followed (after considerable delay) by an application to challenge the conviction itself. I cannot recall whether the previous matters involved an earlier severity appeal or a Crown appeal against sentence, but nothing turns on this, in my view.  
     
      
    63 These applications involve a wasteful duplication of legal and judicial resources. Separate counsel and a differently constituted Court of Criminal Appeal have to master the factual issues upon which the conviction stands. Had the instant appeal succeeded with the conviction being quashed, whether or not a new trial were ordered, the earlier sentencing appeal that engaged the attention of Sully and Kirby JJ and the barristers and solicitors engaged in it would have been a futile waste of time. 
     
      
    64 The extension of time proposed in the appellant’s favour in this particular case proceeds on the basis that the situation is unclear and the extension of time unopposed. There has been no challenge to the affidavit seeking to explain how the appellant came to file a notice of appeal over two years after his sentencing appeal was heard and disposed of.65 An appellant should understand that (without an order based on extraordinary circumstances clearly proved) neither a Notice of Intention to Appeal nor a Notice of Appeal will be permitted to be filed out of time after a sentencing appeal has been heard and determined; and that any application for an extension of time to allow this to take place will be closely scrutinised. Unless the application is demonstrably meritorious it is likely to be refused, especially if the sentence matter has already been dealt with without any prior indication from the appellant of his or her intention to challenge the conviction itself. It should not be assumed that any and every breach of the time limits in the Rules will be excused (see generally R v Lawrence [1980] 1 NSWLR 122 at 147-8).

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: I agree with Hidden J that there should be a grant of leave to appeal and that the appeal should be dismissed. I also agree with his Honour’s reasons. However, I would seek to add some further comments with respect to the argument raised by counsel for the applicant with respect to the ratio of the effective non-parole period to the overall sentence. 
     
      
    2 The argument for the applicant relied on an assumption that the “practice” in relation to federal offenders of specifying a period of 60-66% of the head sentence as the usual non-parole period should be adopted. Indeed, as Hidden J has noted, this Court in Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1, (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [36]-[40] (Howie J, Adams and Price JJ agreeing) expressed the view that it would be “unfair” to adopt the “more severe State regime” under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). In that case, the principal offences were contraventions of Commonwealth law and the offences against State law were described as “only incidental” at [38]. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        It seems to me in such a situation to be unfair to sentence by complying with the more severe State regime under s 44, where the statutory ratio is 75 percent, rather than by adopting the practice for determining the non-parole for Commonwealth offences, where the ratio is 60 to 66 percent. 
        
       
       
      However, at [40] Howie J expressed the qualification that the ratio adopted in relation to Commonwealth offences will not always be appropriate. 
       
      
    3 There are two aspects of this approach which are troubling. The first concerns the justification for the ratio adopted as a matter of practice in relation to federal offences. It is at least possible that part of the justification derived from a time when the overall sentence was subject to remission, but the non-parole period was not. During the period of operation of s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), which was repealed from 16 January 2003, the practice in this State was to reduce a sentence by approximately one-third to take account of the fact that prisoners were not entitled to remissions: see Shore (1992) 66 A Crim R 37 and Director of Public Prosecutions v El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370. However, in jurisdictions where the sentence is subject to remissions, allowance for that fact will need to be made in fixing a non-parole period: see s 19AF. 
     
      
    4 The second concern, is the idea that the operation of the statutory formula under State law may depend upon questions of “fairness” or a judgment as to whether Commonwealth or State offences predominate in a particular case. In sentencing for Commonwealth offences, the Court is exercising federal jurisdiction pursuant to s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). In Williams v The King [No. 2] (1934) 50 CLR 551 at 560, Dixon CJ noted of a particular construction of s 68: 
     
      
       
        
        This accords with the general policy disclosed by the enactment, namely, to place the administration of the criminal law of the Commonwealth in each State upon the same footing as that of the State and to avoid the establishment of two independent systems of criminal justice. It is, in my opinion, no objection to the validity of such a provision that the State law adopted varies in the different States. 
        
       
      
    5 This position continues since the enactment of Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 in 1990. Immediately following the passage just quoted, Dixon J continued: 
     
      
       
        
        The word ‘conviction’ is capable of including sentence, and a construction which confines the description to appeals from verdict and incidental proceedings, and excludes appeals from sentence appears to me inconsistent with the evident purpose of the Legislature of giving to prisoners, at any rate, the same remedies by way of appeal in the case of Federal offences as exist in the case of State offences 
        . 
        
       
      
    6 As noted by Gleeson CJ in Putland v The Queen (2004) 218 CLR 174 at [4], the laws of a State providing for the procedure for trial and conviction on indictment will pick up the laws of a State with respect to sentencing. However, the State laws picked up by s 68(1) will only apply in relation to a federal offence “so far as they are applicable”. There are, in effect, two kinds of constraint on their application. One is that a State law will be inapplicable if the application “would have involved severing and ‘picking up’ part, but not the whole, of an integrated legislative scheme and giving an altered meaning to that severed part of the State legislation”: Putland, at [37] (Gummow and Heydon JJ). The other situation will be where a Commonwealth law, to use the language of s 79 of the Judiciary Act, otherwise provides: Putland, at [41]. 
     
      
    7 Although Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 deals extensively with sentencing practices and principles, it is by no means an exclusive code and it has been accepted that general law principles will continue to operate: see, eg, Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [15]; Putland at [12] (Gleeson CJ), and [52] (Gummow and Heydon JJ, Callinan J agreeing). On the other hand, at [52] in Putland, Gummow and Heydon JJ accepted that Part 1B did make “exhaustive provision” on some subjects, an example being the “separate regime for fixing federal non-parole periods” to be found in Part 1B, Div 4, relying on a statement to that effect in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1989 (Cth), which introduced Part 1B. Nevertheless, there may be a question as to how far that statement should be taken. Although the provisions in Div 4 may be seen as an exhaustive statement of the power to fix a non-parole period or a recognizance release order, in the identified circumstances, there is no attempt to set out the criteria which the Court should take into account, nor to identify the relationship between the non-parole period and sentence. Thus, the “practice” of fixing a non-parole period of between 60 and 66% of the sentence, appears to derive from the application of general law principles. Nevertheless, one particular provision of Div 4 should be noted, namely s 19AJ, which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        19AJ Court may only fix non-parole periods or make recognizance release orders for federal sentences of imprisonment 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          This Division does not authorise a court to fix a single non-parole period, or make a recognizance release order, in respect both of federal sentences of imprisonment and State or Territory sentences of imprisonment 
          . 
          
         
        
       
      
    8 That provision must be read in the context of s 19AB which requires that a court, in sentencing for one or more federal offences must, if it does not make a recognizance release order, “fix a single non-parole period in respect of that sentence or those sentences”: s 19AB(1)(d). As the sentencing in the present case illustrates, the existence of separate regimes for State and federal offences can give rise to potential anomalies where sentences in each category are partly concurrent and partly cumulative and where allowance must be made for the principle of totality, in considering the overall effect of the sentences imposed. (See also s 16E of the Crimes Act 1914.) 
     
      
    9 The applicant’s contention should be rejected for three reasons. First, even if the Commonwealth offences predominated, it does not follow that an appropriate non-parole period should fall within the range of 60-66% of the total sentence period. Accepting the premise as to the usual practice, the conclusion does not follow. As explained by Meagher JA (Wood CJ at CL and Studdert J agreeing) in R v Viana [2001] NSWCCA 171 at [3], and as reiterated in Bick v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 408 at [14] (Price J, Hodgson JA and Howie J agreeing) the usual course does not mean that higher percentages cannot stand. Nor did a higher percentage attract adverse comments in The Queen v Alimic [2006] VSCA 273 (Warren CJ, Nettle and Redlich JJA). Indeed, accepting that the statutory prescription contained in State law does not operate in relation to federal offences, the fact that similar offences under State law might attract a higher ratio of minimum term to sentence is not an irrelevant consideration, given that the Commonwealth regime has adopted a principle of uniformity within the States and Territories, rather than national uniformity: see The Queen v Gee (2003) 212 CLR 230 at [7] (Gleeson CJ), noted by Gummow and Heydon JJ in Putland at [60]). 
     
      
    10 Secondly, the departure from the assumed range for Commonwealth offences and the statutory prescription in relation to State offences occurred because of the dual pressures of the need for a degree of accumulation of sentences and the need to avoid an oppressive total custodial penalty. In order to maintain a custodial penalty sufficient to reflect the seriousness of the conduct an otherwise appropriate ratio may need to be adjusted. 
     
      
    11 Thirdly, as explained by Hidden J, neither the individual sentences, nor the total effect of the sentencing process, resulted in a manifestly excessive sentence. Hidden J has noted a number of reasons why that cannot be accepted. I would only emphasise that the offences committed whilst the applicant was senior assistant official receiver demonstrate a serious breach of trust over an extended period of time. The importance of general deterrence in respect of such conduct by public officers has been explained on many occasions: see, eg, Broadhurst (1988) 25 A Crim R 349 at 353 (Lee J) approved in Delcaro (1989) 41 A Crim R 33 at 36 (Campbell J, Gleeson CJ and Carruthers J agreeing). 
     
      
    12 GROVE J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    13 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Michael Simon Studman, pleaded guilty in the District Court to an indictment containing eighteen counts of a fraudulent nature, most of them under the Commonwealth Crimes Act but some under the New South Wales Crimes Act. The first eleven counts were of fraudulently misappropriating Commonwealth property, an offence under s71(1) of the Crimes Act (C’th) which carried a maximum sentence of imprisonment for seven years. Counts twelve and thirteen were of defrauding a Commonwealth public authority, an offence under s29D of the Crimes Act (C’th) which carried a maximum sentence of imprisonment for ten years. (Both those provisions have since been repealed).  
     
      
    14 The remaining five counts were brought under the New South Wales Crimes Act. Counts fourteen and fifteen were of obtaining money by deception, an offence under s178BA of the Act which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for five years. Counts sixteen, seventeen and eighteen were of fraudulent misappropriation, an offence under s178A of the Act which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for seven years. 
     
      
    15 The applicant was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
    · On counts five, seven and ten (s71 of the Commonwealth Act), concurrent sentences of imprisonment for seven months, dating from 26 August 2005;  
     
      
    · On counts one to four, six, eight, nine and eleven (also under s71), concurrent sentences of imprisonment for twenty-two months, dating from 26 February 2006; 
     
      
    · On counts twelve and thirteen (s29D of the Commonwealth Act), concurrent sentences of imprisonment for twenty-seven months, dating from 26 November 2007; 
     
      
       
      These sentences resulted in an overall head sentence of four-and-a-half years, in respect of which his Honour fixed a non-parole period of two years and nine months.  
       
      
    · On counts fourteen, fifteen and sixteen (ss178BA and 178A of the New South Wales Act), concurrent sentences of imprisonment for eleven months, dating from 26 February 2008, with a non-parole period of six months; 
     
      
    · On counts seventeen and eighteen (also s178A), concurrent sentences of imprisonment for eleven months, dating from 26 August 2008, again with a non-parole period of six months. 
     
      
    16 The sentences for the State offences amounted to an overall sentence of imprisonment for seventeen months with a non-parole period of twelve months. The aggregate of all the sentences was an overall sentence of four-and-a-half years with a non-parole period of three-and-a-half years. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    17 The facts have been helpfully summarised in the Crown’s written submissions. Put shortly, over a period between 1996 and 2003 the applicant used his position as a senior officer of the Insolvency and Trustee Service (ITSA), and later his position as a senior employee of a firm called Simms Partners (a partner of which was a registered trustee in bankruptcy), to misappropriate a little over $514,000 from a number of bankrupt estates administered by ITSA and by the partner of the firm. The Commonwealth offences related to his conduct while at ITSA, and the State offences were committed while he was employed at Simms Partners. 
     
      
    18 Counts twelve and thirteen, the two offences of defrauding a Commonwealth public authority, were committed with an accomplice, who has since died. Of the total amount defrauded, the accomplice obtained an amount just under $132,400, and the applicant obtained the balance. 
     
      
    19 The Commonwealth offences were committed between 1999 and 2001, when the applicant was the Senior Assistant Official Receiver at ITSA, exercising powers delegated to him by the Official Trustee relating to the administration of bankrupt estates.  
     
      
    20 Counts two to eight and eleven arose from the applicant’s lodgement and approval of false and fictitious proofs of debt in various bankruptcies. Dividends relating to those debts were then paid out of the bankrupt estates into bank accounts operated by the applicant in false names. Count eleven related to his fraudulently authorising the payment of a refund from a bankrupt estate to a bank account which he controlled. He used false identities and fictitious business entities, together with related false addresses and bank accounts, to facilitate the commission of the offences and to evade detection. The total amount involved in these offences was roughly $120,300.  
     
      
    21 Count one involved a more complex fraud on his part. In his official capacity he contrived a settlement with a bankrupt, as a result of which the bankrupt paid $15,000 to the Official Receiver. The cheque sent by the bankrupt to ITSA was falsely recorded as a payment relating to the composition of a different bankruptcy. The applicant fabricated documents relating to this composition and its rejection, which resulted in the $15,000 being refunded to a false identity used by him.  
     
      
    22 Count nine arose from the use of his position to fraudulently alter cheques endorsed as payable to ITSA, and misappropriate their proceeds in amounts totalling roughly $18,300. All the counts referred to so far were offences of fraudulently misappropriating Commonwealth property (s71 of the Commonwealth Act). 
     
      
    23 Counts twelve and thirteen, offences of defrauding a Commonwealth public authority under s29D of the Act, related to fraudulent claims the applicant made, in the course of his employment at ITSA, upon the Stevedoring Industry Reform Small Business Compensation Fund. The claims were for losses purportedly suffered by fictitious entities as a result of the waterfront dispute between Patricks Stevedores and the Maritime Union of Australia in the late 1990s. He created fictitious entities, forged documents, and used bank accounts and post office boxes in false names. The total amount defrauded, which he shared with his accomplice, was a little over $264,600.  
     
      
    24 As I have said, the remaining five counts were offences under the State Act. They were committed between 2002 and 2003, while the applicant’s position at Simms Partners involved his assisting the partner who was the registered trustee in bankruptcy. Broadly speaking, his conduct was similar to that in which he engaged at ITSA. 
     
      
    25 Counts fourteen and fifteen, offences of obtaining money by deception under s178BA of the Act, involved his approving fictitious proofs of debt payable to fictitious entities controlled by him. The amounts involved totalled a little under $27,500. Counts sixteen to eighteen, charges of fraudulent misappropriation under s178A of the Act, arose from his issuing cheques payable to ITSA for realisation charges in relation to various bankrupt estates. He fraudulently altered those cheques and paid them into a bank account which he operated. The amounts misappropriated totalled roughly $50,400.  
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    26 The applicant was forty-nine years old at the time of sentence, and is now fifty-one. He has a minor criminal history, of no present significance.  
     
      
    27 There was evidence that at the time of the offences he suffered a severe gambling addiction, which the sentencing judge found to have been the motivation for his criminal activity. In the light of psychological evidence, his Honour accepted this condition as a recognised mental health problem, and found that it impeded the applicant’s capacity for self control and balanced judgment. It seems that his gambling engendered a cycle of anxiety, guilt and depression, from which he sought relief by further gambling. His Honour saw it as having “hurtled” him into a “calamitous predicament”. 
     
      
    28 The applicant indicated early an intention to plead guilty to the charges and co-operated with investigating authorities. His Honour found him to be deeply contrite. At the time he stood for sentence he had sought treatment for his addiction, and his Honour assessed his prospects of rehabilitation as “positive and strongly so”. Notwithstanding the serious effects of his conduct upon his financial position and his employment opportunities, his partner remained supportive of him. The psychologist who provided a report expressed the view that he would require “extensive and prolonged treatment.” 
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    29 The submissions of Mr Odgers SC, for the applicant, were directed primarily to the effective non-parole period and its proportionate relationship to the overall sentence. However, argument was directed specifically to the sentences for counts twelve and thirteen, in which an accomplice was involved. That person created the letterheads and supporting documentation to enable the relevant claims to be made, having the technical expertise to do so.  
     
      
    30 As to those counts, his Honour said in his remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        The law also regards the commission of offences “in company” as aggravating the criminality. The commission of an offence with an accomplice is for the purposes of the law committing the offence in company. It is not difficult to understand why working with an accomplice should be regarded as an aggravating feature. It supplies the offender with greater resources and options to commit the offences he would commit. 
        
       
      
    31 Mr Odgers argued that his Honour had misconceived the notion of the commission of crime in company as an aggravating factor. It is such a factor, he said, only in cases where it has an adverse effect upon the victim of a crime. By way of example, he referred to the offence of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, that is, being in company, under s61J(2)(c) of the Crimes Act (NSW). The rationale of that aggravating factor is that the presence of more than one offender is more coercive and intimidating of the victim: R v Button & Anor (2002) 129 A Crim R 242. He argued that this is the sense in which the expression “in company” is enacted as an aggravating factor for State offences in s21A(2)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    32 He accepted that an aggravating factor of that kind would be recognised in sentencing for Commonwealth offences, even though it is not one of the matters enumerated in s16A(2) of the Crimes Act (C’th). He noted, however, that the present case is not of that kind. Indeed, he argued that the applicant’s criminality would have been greater if he had committed those two offences on his own and kept all the money obtained from them.  
     
      
    33 The Crown prosecutor submitted that his Honour’s approach was sound, and that the notion of the commission of an offence in company as an aggravating factor is not confined in the manner for which Mr Odgers contended. He referred to R v Harmouche (2005) 158 A Crim R 357. That was a Crown appeal against a sentence for supplying cocaine, in which Hulme J, delivering the leading judgment, held that the fact that the respondent was a participant in a network of drug supply meant that his offence was committed in company for the purpose of s21A(2)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: see the judgment at [28] and [69]. 
     
      
    34 Mr Odgers made it clear that he pursued this ground of the application only for the purpose of achieving an adjustment of the sentences on those two counts which would leave the overall head sentence intact but lead to a reduction of the effective non-parole period. Certainly, viewed in isolation, the concurrent sentences of imprisonment for twenty-seven months for those two counts are moderate and, even if his Honour were found to be in error, they would not warrant this Court’s intervention. The competing arguments are worth recording and are not without interest. However, as will be seen, I find it unnecessary to decide them because of the view I take of the application as a whole. 
     
      
    35 Mr Odgers’ challenge to the effective non-parole period of three-and-a-half years was on two bases. That non-parole period is just under 78 per cent of the overall head sentence of four-and-a-half years. He noted that the ratio of non-parole period to sentence for Commonwealth offences is usually in the range of 60 to 66 per cent, and he argued that the proportion in the present case should have been within that range. 
     
      
    36 For this he relied upon Cahyadi v The Queen (2007) 168 A Crim R 41. That was a case involving related Commonwealth and State offences, in which this Court held that the practice relating to Commonwealth offences should have been applied to the determination of the effective non-parole period: see the leading judgment of Howie J at [37]-[39]. Howie J observed that that applicant’s criminality had been primarily in contravention of Commonwealth law, and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        It seems to me in such a situation to be unfair to sentence by complying with the more severe State regime under s44, where the statutory ratio is 75 per cent, rather than by adopting the practice for determining the non-parole period for Commonwealth offences, where the ratio is 60 to 66 per cent. 
        
       
      
    37 Mr Odgers also noted that in the present case his Honour departed from the statutory ratio between sentence and non-parole period in relation to the State offences, the ratio of the effective non-parole period for those offences of twelve months to the overall sentence of seventeen months being 71 per cent. Yet that proportion was not maintained in the overall sentence for all offences, and Mr Odgers argued that this was a case in which there was clearly a basis for a finding of special circumstances under the State sentencing regime warranting a significant reduction from the usual proportion of 75 per cent. He relied on the applicant’s subjective case generally but, particularly, upon his gambling addiction, which had provoked his criminal activity and for which he needed prolonged treatment. 
     
      
    38 The Crown prosecutor sought to distinguish Cahyadi on the basis that in that case the State offence was seen as no more than incidental to the Commonwealth offences, whereas in the present case the State offences stood alone and represented a separate phase of serious criminal activity. I can see the force of that argument, just as I can see the force of Mr Odgers’ submission that it might have been beneficial for the applicant to have an extended period of parole eligibility to adjust to life in the community and, particularly, to address his long standing gambling addiction. Again, however, I find it unnecessary to decide either of those matters.  
     
      
    39 The difficulty the applicant faces is that both the overall sentence and the effective non-parole period are lenient. His Honour rightly stressed the seriousness of these offences. This was major and systematic fraud, perpetrated over two lengthy periods by a man occupying important positions of trust. It is settled law that, while an important function of a non-parole period is the rehabilitation of an offender by affording the opportunity of release under supervision and sanction, it must also mark the offender’s criminality by reflecting considerations of punishment and deterrence: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, per Spigelman CJ at [63]–[64]. In my view, no lesser non-parole period would serve that function in the present case: s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  
     
      
    40 Since preparing these reasons I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons of Basten JA. I remain of the view that it is unnecessary to decide Mr Odgers’ argument based upon Cahyadi. This is not the occasion to re-examine the line of authority concerning the approach to setting non-parole periods for Commonwealth offences. 
     
      
    41 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

     REGINA v JS 
     
     
      
       
      The Respondent was tried for two indictable offences under the  
      Crimes Act  
      1914 (Cth) related to the alleged intentional destruction of computer data that may have been required in evidence in a judicial proceeding.  
       
       
      At the end of the trial, the trial judge, Fullerton J, directed the jury to return a verdict of acquittal. In doing so, the trial judge accepted the Respondent’s submissions that s39 of the  
      Crimes Act  
      requires the prosecution to prove an accused knew that the proceedings in which the evidence may be required were federal proceedings. This finding turned on the definition of “judicial proceeding” in s31 of the  
      Crimes Act,  
      read in the light of the provisions of the  
      Criminal Code 
      . As the Crown’s case contained no evidence that would satisfy the requirement, a directed acquittal was ordered.  
       
       
      The Crown appealed to the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal. A right on the part of the Crown to appeal from an acquittal of a criminal charge in certain circumstances, including a directed acquittal, was created by the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Amendment (Double Jeopardy) Act  
      2006, which inserted s107 into the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act  
      2001. 
       
       
      The Respondent raised a number of jurisdictional issues, challenging the capacity of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal to hear the appeal. 
       
       
      Held (dismissing the appeal): 
       
      The retrospectivity issue with respect to s107 of the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act  
      2001 
       
       
      (per Spigelman CJ, Mason P, McClellan CJ at CL, Hidden J and Howie J agreeing) 
       
       
      1 The inability of the Crown to appeal against an acquittal is a fundamental principle of the criminal law. [26]-[30], [162], [194], [195], [196]

      2 A statute will not be interpreted to overturn a fundamental principle in the absence of a clear statement that that was Parliament’s intention. [31]-[32], [162], [194], [195], [196]

      3 The interpretative principle that Parliament did not intend a statute to operate retrospectively in the absence of a clear statement of such intention is of particular strength in the administration of criminal justice. [33], [46], [162], [194], [195], [196]

      5 Section 107 of the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act  
      2001 has no application to the trial and acquittal of the Respondent because the section commenced operation after the institution of proceedings against him. [42]-[44], [48], [162], [194], [195], [196]

      The notice of appeal issue 
       
       
      (per Spigelman CJ, Mason P, McClellan CJ at CL, Hidden J and Howie J agreeing) 
       
       
      1 The Respondent’s contention that the Appellant failed to file a valid Notice of Appeal as provided for in s107(3) of the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act  
      2001 should be rejected. [54], [162], [194], [195], [196] 
       
       
      2 In view of the express power to grant leave to appeal after the expiry of time, the Appellant’s failure to identify matters that should have been identified in the Notice of Appeal did not render that Notice invalid. The Court’s jurisdiction was appropriately invoked. There was no denial of procedural fairness, because the Respondent could not have been in doubt as to issues raised in the Appeal.

      The question of law issue 
       
       
      (per Spigelman CJ, Mason P, McClellan CJ at CL, Hidden J and Howie J agreeing) 
       
       
      1 Leave should be granted to the Appellant to amend its Notice of Appeal, but only with respect to proposed grounds 2 and 3.  
       
       
      2 The determinative step in the trial judge’s reasoning was the interpretation of the statute, which involved a question of law alone. [70], [83], [162], [194], [195], [196]

      The constitutional issue 
       
       
      (per Spigelman CJ, Mason P, McClellan CJ at CL, Hidden J and Howie J agreeing) 
       
       
      1 The constitutional issue raised is whether or not the finality of a verdict of acquittal is an essential characteristic of trial by jury within the meaning of s80 of the  
      Constitution 
      .

      2 This Court is bound to follow a decision of another intermediate appellate court unless satisfied that it is wrong. 
       
       
        
        Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Limited 
         (1993) 177 CLR 485 applied. 
        
       
       
      3 There is a decision of the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal precisely in point and the conclusion is open. The only directly relevant High Court authority is equally divided. 
       
       
        
        The King v Snow

        R v Sung Bo Kim  
        (1993) 65 A Crim R 278 followed. 
        
       
       
      4 The Respondent’s contention should be rejected. [92], [162], [194], [195], [196] 
       
       
       
      (per Mason P) 
       
       
      5 The appeal does not engage the body of case law that permits proceedings to be regarded as a nullity because of non-compliance with a fundamental aspect of the concept of trial on indictment. [165] 
       
       
        
        Crane v Director of Public Prosecutions 
         [1921] 2 AC 299;  
        Swansson v The Queen 
         (2007) 168 A Crim R 263 cited.  
        
       
       
      6 The principle that a jury verdict of acquittal was “final” is a principle of English common law that prevailed in the Australian colonies as at 1900. The finality principles, however, are located outside the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury and relate instead to principles of double jeopardy. [177]-[178], [180], [193]

      Judiciary Act 
       is of a quasi-constitutional character. Its purpose of ensuring that accused persons in each State are, with defined exceptions, subject to the same incidents of a criminal trial for Commonwealth offences as for State offences is of overriding significance and displaces the application of other interpretative principles.

      1 The federal character of the judicial proceeding, referred to in s39 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       and defined in s31 of that Act, cannot be separated from its character as a judicial proceeding with respect to the linkage to the reference to ‘knowledge’, and the fault element of the offence. It is necessary for the prosecution to prove an accused has knowledge that data could be used in a  
      federal  
      judicial proceeding. [156], [158], [162], [194], [195], [196]

[149], [162], [194], [195], [196] The Appellant’s reliance on s9.3 of the  
      Criminal Code  
      was misplaced. [152]-[157] It is not appropriate when applying the

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Respondent stood trial on indictment for two charges, the first of which read as follows, with portions omitted for reasons I will explain below: 
     
      
       
        
        “On or about 30 January 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, knowing that … computer data for the testing of … may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding, did procure the conduct of another person, namely … to intentionally destroy or render said data illegible or undecipherable or incapable of identification with intent thereby to prevent it from being used in evidence. 
         
         
        ...” 
        
       
      
    2 The second count on the indictment alleged an attempt to commit the offence identified in the first count.  
     
      
    3 At the close of the Crown case her Honour Justice Fullerton directed a verdict with respect to both counts. There is no challenge to the directed verdict on the attempt count. 
     
      
    4 An appeal against an acquittal is permissible in certain circumstances, relevantly an acquittal by direction, under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (“the Act”). Section 111 of that Act prohibits the publication of matters which may identify a person who has been acquitted. Although that section does not bind the Court, as judgments of the Court are available in electronic form and may be widely circulated, I have sought to preserve the Respondent’s anonymity in this judgment. This has also required the deletion of certain references from the indictment and from the judgment of Justice Fullerton. 
     
      
       
      The Statutory Context 
       
      
    5 The issue comes before this Court by reason of the creation by statute of the right on the part of the Crown to appeal from an acquittal of a criminal charge as introduced in this State by the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Amendment (Double Jeopardy) Act 2006 (the “2006 Amendment Act”) which inserted Pt 8 “Acquittals” into the Act. The directly relevant section is s107 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “107(1) This section applies to the acquittal of a person:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) by a jury at the direction of the trial Judge, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) by a Judge of the Supreme Court or District Court in criminal proceedings for an indictable offence tried by the Judge without a jury, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) by the Supreme Court or the Land and Environment Court in its summary jurisdiction in any proceedings in which the Crown was a party. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any such acquittal on any ground that involves a question of law alone. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) An appeal may be made within 28 days after the acquittal or, with the leave of the Court of Criminal Appeal, may be made after that period. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The accused person is entitled to be present and heard at the appeal. However, the appeal can be determined even if the person is not present so long as the person has been given a reasonable opportunity to be present. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) The Court of Criminal Appeal may affirm or quash the acquittal appealed against. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) If the acquittal is quashed, the Court of Criminal Appeal may order a new trial in such manner as the Court thinks fit. For that purpose, the Court may (subject to the  
        Bail Act 1978 
        ) order the detention or return to custody of the accused person in connection with the new trial. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) If the acquittal is quashed, the Court of Criminal Appeal cannot proceed to convict or sentence the accused person for the offence charged nor direct the court conducting the new trial to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        (8) This section does not apply to a person who was acquitted before the commencement of this section.” 
        
       
      
    6 The offence alleged involved a contravention of s39 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “39 Any person who, knowing that any book, document, or other thing of any kind, is or may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding, intentionally destroys it or renders it illegible or undecipherable or incapable of identification, with intent thereby to prevent it from being used in evidence, shall be guilty of an offence.” 
        
       
      
    7 Of central significance in this case is the fact that the words “a judicial proceeding” in s39 of the Crimes Act are the subject of specific definition in s31 of the Act as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “31  
        judicial proceeding 
          
        means a proceeding in or before a federal court, court exercising federal jurisdiction or court of a Territory, and includes a proceeding before a body or person acting under the law of the Commonwealth, or of a Territory, in which evidence may be taken on oath.” 
        
       
      
    8 The constituent elements of the offence must now be understood in accordance with the application to the s39 offence of the provisions of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (“the Criminal Code”), which require a particular analysis, in accordance with the requirements of that Code. The relevant provisions are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “3.1 Elements 
        
       
       
        
        (1) An offence consists of physical elements and fault elements. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) However, the law that creates the offence may provide that there is no fault element for one or more physical elements. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The law that creates the offence may provide different fault elements for different physical elements. 
        
       
       
        
        3.2 Establishing guilt in respect of offences 
        
       
       
        
        In order for a person to be found guilty of committing an offence the following must be proved: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the existence of such physical elements as are, under the law creating the offence, relevant to establishing guilt; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in respect of each such physical element for which a fault element is required, one of the fault elements for the physical element.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    9 Section 4.1 identifies three matters capable of constituting a “physical element”. The relevant matter is 4.1(1)(c) “a circumstance in which conduct … occurs”.  
     
      
    10 Section 5.1 of the Criminal Code states: 
     
      
       
        
        “5.1(1) A fault element for a particular physical element may be intention, knowledge, recklessness or negligence. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent a law that creates a particular offence from specifying other fault elements for a physical element of that offence.” 
        
       
      
    11 By reason of the express reference to knowledge in s39 of the Crimes Act, the relevant fault element for present purposes is “knowledge” which is defined in s5.3: 
     
      
       
        
        “5.3 A person has knowledge of a circumstance or a result if he or she is aware that it exists or will exist in the ordinary course of events.” 
        
       
      
    12 It is pertinent also to note s5.6 which states: 
     
      
       
        
        “5.6(1) If the law creating the offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element that consists only of conduct, intention is the fault element for that physical element. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) If the law creating the offence does not specify a fault element for a physical element that consists of a circumstance or a result, recklessness is the fault element for that physical element.” 
        
       
      
    13 The Appellant also relied on s9.3 of the Criminal Code which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “9.3(1) A person can be criminally responsible for an offence even if, at the time of the conduct constituting the offence, he or she is mistaken about, or ignorant of, the existence or content of an Act that directly or indirectly creates the offence or directly or indirectly affects the scope or operation of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection (1) does not apply, and the person is not criminally responsible for the offence in those circumstances, if : 
         
         
        (a) the Act is expressly or implied to the contrary effect; or 
         
         
        (b) the ignorance or mistake negates a fault element that applies to a physical element of the offence.” 
        
       
       
      The Judgment of Fullerton J 
       
      
    14 The critical matter in the submissions on behalf of the Respondent, upon which he was successful before Fullerton J, was the definition of “judicial proceedings” in s31 of the Crimes Act, which requires the relevant proceedings to be proceedings in a court exercising federal jurisdiction, a Federal court or a court of a Territory, to which it is convenient to refer hereafter as “federal proceedings”. He submitted, successfully, that whatever the state of the evidence on the Crown case may be with respect to the Respondent’s knowledge of judicial proceedings, a matter upon which other submissions were made, there was no evidence that he had any knowledge that such proceedings were federal proceedings. 
     
      
    15 Fullerton J set out the Crown submissions before her as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[22] The Crown submits that, to prove that the accused knew that the computer data may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding, it is sufficient that he was aware that it was a reasonable possibility that proceedings would be brought in a Court, and that the data may be required as evidence in those proceedings, but that it need not prove that the accused knew that that the proceeding in which the data might be required was a judicial proceeding  
        as defined 
        , in effect, a Federal judicial proceeding. So ever long as there were, at the date the offence is alleged to have been committed, identifiable potential judicial proceedings wherein the data may have been be required as evidence, and that the accused was aware of the facts that would in fact support a cause of action in those judicial proceedings when he procured … to destroy the data, that, according to the Crown, is sufficient for the matter to be left to the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        [23] In a written submission Mr Robberds QC expressed it as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          If the accused  
          knew 
           that: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          the data may be required in evidence (i) in litigation (ii) where the consumers sued [the company] (iii) for injuries suffered because of a defect in the … (iv) manufactured by [the company] (v) (i.e. the accused knew each of those 5 facts) 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          then he  
          knew 
           that the data may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding as defined in section 31 of the Crimes Act. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          And the reason he  
          knew 
           that fact is because that litigation is a proceeding based on section 75 AD of the Trade Practices Act which is a proceeding that could be brought before a court exercising federal jurisdiction. (my underlining). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        On this construction, proof that the potential proceedings were Federal proceedings is an objective fact and not part of the circumstance to which the fault element relates. On this construction, the Crown is, in effect, either imposing absolute liability to proof of the fact of the identification of the proceedings as part of the physical element in circumstances where the Parliament has not made provision for it, or it is applying a gloss to the construction of the section by reading the composite phrase ‘may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding’ in such a way as to separate ‘judicial proceedings’ from the preceding part of the composite phrase. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        [24] By contrast, the accused contends that on a proper construction of the section the Crown must prove that the accused knew that the data may be required in evidence in a Federal proceeding, that is the Crown must prove that the accused knew, in the sense that he was aware of the fact that the potential proceedings in which the data may be required as evidence were Federal judicial proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        [25] It is conceded by the Crown there is no evidence of this.” 
        
       
      
    16 Fullerton J referred to a number of principles of the law of statutory interpretation and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[38] In my view, to read the section the way the Crown asks me to would be unreasonable and would fail to do credit to the actual words of the section. I note that the draftsperson provided neither punctuation or parentheses to separate out or signify a different reading of the composite clause  
        “is or may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding” 
        .  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [39] The plain words of the section, and the declared operation of the  
        Criminal Code 
         (Cth) as provided for in the provisions of Chapter 2 to which I have referred, in my view require the prosecution to prove that an accused knew that the proceedings in which the evidence may be required were or are Federal judicial proceedings, even if the particular proceedings are not at the time of the destruction capable of being identified.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [40] I am fortified in this conclusion by the fact that, in the comprehensive review of the many offences found across the body of Commonwealth statutes undertaken in 2000 and 2001, a review undertaken with a view to harmonising all offence creating and related provisions with the codified principles of criminal liability in Chapter 2 of the  
        Criminal Code 
         (Cth), the Parliament made no provision in s 39 for the physical circumstance of ‘judicial proceeding’ to be a matter of absolute liability or strict liability or otherwise a physical element requiring no fault element. By contrast, the Parliament has made express provision for physical elements or parts thereof to be matters of absolute or strict liability, and provided for no fault element in many offence-creating provisions of the  
        Criminal Code 
         (Cth) following the repeal of offences that had hitherto been located within the  
        Crimes Act 
         (Cth) (see for example ss131.1 and 132.1 under Part 7.2 of the  
        Criminal Code 
         (Cth). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [41] Absolute liability in respect of one component of a physical element cannot be read into the s 39. Neither can a requirement that there be no fault element in respect of a physical element or a component of a physical element. The  
        Criminal Code 
         (Cth) implicitly forbids it.  
        
       
       
        
        [42] In these circumstances, on a proper construction of the section, the Crown must prove that the accused knew that the data may be required in Federal judicial proceedings and there being no evidence that he was at any relevant time aware of that fact, a verdict of not guilty must be directed.” 
        
       
       
      Issues on the Appeal 
       
      
    17 At par [16] above I have set out par [23] of the judgment of Fullerton J in which her Honour repeats the Crown’s contention as to the interpretation of the offence under s39 of the Crimes Act, in the light of the provisions of the Criminal Code. The Appellant contends in this Court that her Honour erred in rejecting that submission, which was reformulated in the submissions to this Court. The basic issue on this appeal is whether Fullerton J was wrong in concluding that s39 requires the prosecution to prove an accused knew that the proceedings in which the evidence may be required were federal proceedings. 
     
      
    18 In submissions to this Court the Appellant contended for the following construction of s39: 
     
      
       
        
        “The physical and fault elements of the offence in section 39 of the Crimes Act (and their connection) are more accurately stated as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        Physical elements 
        
       
       
        
        (i) conduct – destruction of book etc. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the circumstances in which the conduct occurs – the book etc may be required in evidence in litigation (which are facts) – which litigation is a judicial proceeding as defined by section 31 (which is a question of law). 
        
       
       
        
        Fault elements 
        
       
       
        
        (a) knowledge that the book etc may be required in evidence in litigation (which are facts) – which litigation is a judicial proceeding as defined by section 31 (which is a question of law); 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the destruction of the book etc is intentional; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) intention to prevent the book etc being used in evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Fault elements (b) and (c) apply to physical element (i). 
        
       
       
        
        Fault element (a) applies to physical element (ii).” 
        
       
      
    19 The Respondent contended that Fullerton J was correct in her interpretation. By way of Notice of Contention the Respondent raised four jurisdictional issues as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Section 107 of the  
        Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act  
        2001 has no application to the trial and acquittal of the Respondent because the section commenced operation after the commencement of the trial of the Respondent. 
         
         
        (ii) The appeal is unconstitutional because section 80 of the Commonwealth Constitution prevents the Crown from appealing against a verdict of acquittal by a jury in a federal criminal proceeding. 
         
         
        (iii) Section 68(2) of the  
        Judiciary Act  
        1903 (Cth) does not apply to appeals against acquittal and hence does not confer jurisdiction on a state appellate court to hear an appeal brought under the provisions of a state law against the acquittal of a person in respect of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth. 
         
         
        (iv) The appeal should be regarded as being out of time because the Appellant failed to file a valid notice of appeal within the period prescribed by s 107(3) of the  
        Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act  
        2001. 
        
       
      
    20 The Respondent also contended that the appeal involved a mixed question of fact and law and, accordingly, did not raise “a question of law alone” within the meaning of s107 of the Act.  
     
      
    21 Furthermore, the Respondent contended that this Court should not, in the circumstances of this case, exercise what it identified as the separate discretions created by the use of the word “may” in each of s107(5) and s107(6) i.e., respectively, a discretion to quash the acquittal and a discretion to order a new trial. 
     
      
       
      The Retrospectivity Issue 
       
      
    22 Section 107 of the Act, which permits an appeal against a directed verdict of acquittal, came into force on 15 December 2006. The Respondent was re-arraigned in the Supreme Court on 21 February 2007 and thereafter stood trial in this Court. This was in fact the third trial on this charge.  
     
      
    23 The original indictment was filed in the District Court and the Respondent was first arraigned at the time of his first trial in the District Court on 13 March 2006. He was arraigned again at the time of his second trial in the District Court on 6 November 2006. Pursuant to s128(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and clause 14 of Practice Notice SC CL 2, permission was granted to proceed with the case in the Supreme Court. The matter was first mentioned in the Criminal List of this Court on 1 December 2006 and an indictment was filed in the Court at a mention of the proceedings on 8 December 2006. A further indictment providing particulars was filed on 19 February 2007 and the Respondent was arraigned on 21 February 2007. 
     
      
    24 In the materials before the Court are three indictments, dated 13 March 2006, 6 November 2006 and 21 February 2007. The first differs from the next two only in that it asserts the offence to have occurred on 31 January 2003, whereas the second and third indictments specify the date as 30 January 2003. That was an issue of significance for purposes not presently material. The third indictment adds particulars for the two counts. Save in these respects all three indictments are in the same terms alleging the same offence.  
     
      
    25 Although the date of the Respondent’s re-arraignment in this Court was after the date of the coming into effect of the statute, the indictment was filed before that date and the proceedings were clearly a continuation of the earlier proceedings in the District Court. It was not suggested by the Crown in this Court that the date of the arraignment in this Court was determinative of the retrospectivity issue raised by the Respondent. The Crown’s position in this respect was that the legislation should be interpreted as to applying to proceedings already commenced. 
     
      
    26 The introduction of Pt 8 of the Act, by the 2006 Amendment Act, recognises by its very title, in the parenthetic reference to “Double Jeopardy”, and by its careful, precise and restricted identification of the circumstances in which an appeal against an acquittal is permissible, that the legislation was altering a fundamental principle of the criminal law.  
     
      
    27 The fundamental nature of the principle was expressed by Griffiths CJ in The King v Snow (1915) 20 CLR 315 at 322: 
     
      
       
        
        “The common law doctrine as to the effect of a verdict of acquittal is too well settled to require exposition, and it is too late to inquire into its origin. If it had been intended by the framers of the Constitution to abrogate that doctrine in Australia, and to confer upon the High Court a new authority, such as had never been exercised under the British system of jurisprudence by any court of either original or appellate jurisdiction, it might have been anticipated that so revolutionary a change would have been expressed in the clearest language.” 
        
       
      
    28 In a joint judgment Gavin Duffy and Rich JJ similarly concluded at 364: 
     
      
       
        
        “First, out of respect for life when all felonies were capital, and later, out of respect for character and reputation, the Courts resisted every attack on the inviolability of the verdict of ‘not guilty’ and that inviolability has remained part of the substantive law to the present day.” 
        
       
      
    29 It is significant that in Snow the Court was concerned with the interpretation of s73 of the Commonwealth Constitution, with a view to determining whether or not the Parliament of the United Kingdom, when enacting the Constitution Act should be understood as subject to the principle of statutory interpretation applied expressly by Griffiths CJ. The other three members of the bench were not prepared to interpret the Constitutional provision in that manner. The fact that what was being interpreted was a Constitution, rather than an ordinary statute was of critical significance in their Honour’s reasoning. (See esp at 333-334, 350-352 (per Isaacs J); 354-355 (per Higgins J); and 368-369 (per Powers J).)  
     
      
    30 It will be necessary to return to the constitutional position below. However, for the purpose of determining the retrospectivity issue, this Court should proceed on the well-established principle of the law of statutory interpretation that the New South Wales Parliament does not intend to modify fundamental principles or common law rights without a clear statement that it was doing so. This Court has applied this approach to the determination of whether or not an appeal could lie from a decision by a trial judge to direct a verdict of acquittal, on the basis that, in view of the strength of the presumption, Parliament did not intend the words “interlocutory judgment or order” in s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to extend to such a decision. (See R v Lethlean (1995) 83 A Crim R 197 esp at 202-204; R v Cheng [1999] NSWCCA 373; 48 NSWLR 616 esp at [19]-[29].) By reference to these cases, the drafter of the 2006 Amendment Act must have been well aware of the principle of the law of statutory interpretation that would be applied by the Courts to legislation of this specific character.  
     
      
    31 The relevant test of the precision with which the Parliament must indicate that it intends to overturn a fundamental common law principle has been variously expressed, including: 
     
      
    · “Irresistible clearness” (Potter v Minahan (1908) 7 CLR 277 at 304); 
     
      
    · “The clearest language” (R v Snow supra at 322); 
     
      
    · “Unambiguously clear” (Bropho v Western Australia (1990) 171 CLR 1 at 17); 
     
      
    · “Clearly manifested by unmistakeable and unambiguous language” (Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437); 
     
      
    · “Clear words or necessary implication” (Daniels Corporation International Pty Limited v Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (2002) 213 CLR 543 at [11]). 
     
      
    32 These formulations are equivalent. (See Durham Holdings Pty Limited v New South Wales [1999] NSWCA 324; 47 NSWLR 340 at 353 [44].) It is convenient to refer to them, for the purpose of the law of statutory interpretation, as the clear statement principle. (See J J Spigelman “The Principle of Legality and the Clear Statement Principle” (2005) 79 ALJ 769 at 779.) 
     
      
    33 This particular interpretive principle is reinforced by, and in the present case, overlaps with the application of another interpretive principle of particular strength in the context of the administration of criminal justice. This is the principle against the retrospective operation of a statute, to which the clear statement of principle also applies, again having been the subject of various equivalent formulations in cases in which a retrospectivity issue has arisen: 
     
      
    · “Unless the intention appears with reasonable certainty” (Maxwell v Murphy (1957) 96 CLR 261 at 267); 
     
      
    · “Unless the language of the statute expressly or by necessary implication requires such construction” (Rodway v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 515 at 518); 
     
      
    · “Unless a special intention appears” (Newell v The King (1936) 55 CLR 707 at 711). 
     
      
    34 Both of these interpretive principles should now be understood as specific examples of the unifying concept of the principle of legality. (See J J Spigelman “The Principle of Legality and the Clear Statement Principle” (2005) 79 ALJ 769 at 774-775.)  
     
      
    35 The concept of “the principle of legality” was reintroduced into contemporary discourse by Lord Steyn, being a term he found in the fourth edition of Halsbury’s Laws of England. (See Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed) reissue vol 8(2) (1996) par 6; R v Secretary of State to the Home Department ex parte Pierson [1998] AC 539 at 587.) However, fifty years ago Glanville Williams employed those very words as the translation of the principle of Roman Law expressed in the maxim nullum crimen nulla poena sine lege – there is no crime nor punishment except in accordance with law. He set out what remains the most comprehensive consideration of the principle of legality to the criminal law. (Glanville Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part, London, Stephen & Sons (1953) Ch 12.) Professor Williams specifically identified the principle of non-retroactivity of penal statutes as an example of the principle of legality. (See Glanville Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part (2nd ed) London, Stephen & Sons (1961) at pp579-581.) 
     
      
    36 As Lord Hoffman expressed the principle in R v Secretary of State for Home Department ex parte Simms [2002] 2 AC 115 at 131: 
     
      
       
        
        “The principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in a democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual.” 
        
       
      
    37 This passage has been quoted with approval by both Gleeson CJ and Kirby P. (See Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth (2003) 211 CLR 476 at [30]; Al-Kateb v Godwin (2004) 219 CLR 562 at [19], fn 11; Daniels Corp International supra at 582; Attorney-General (WA) v Marquet (2003) 217 CLR 545 at [180].) 
     
      
    38 To similar effect were the observations of Lord Simon of Glaisdale Ealing London Borough Council v Race Relations Board [1972] AC 342 at 361 who said that the cannons of construction: 
     
      
       
        
        “are … constitutionally salutary in helping to ensure that legislators are not left in doubt as to what they are taking responsibility for.” 
        
       
      
    39 In view of the force of this considerable and longstanding body of case law, and its specific application to the interpretation of legislation which impinges upon the common law principle that there is no appeal from an acquittal, it is understandable that the drafter of the 2006 Amendment Act gave express attention to the issue of retrospectivity. S/he understood that this matter had to be addressed with respect to each of the two quite distinct sets of provisions to which Pt 8 applied.  
     
      
    40 Division 2 of Pt 8 is entitled “Retrial after Acquittal for Very Serious Offence” and is concerned with two situations: first, where there is fresh and compelling evidence, as defined, and secondly, where there is a “tainted acquittal”, also as defined. In the case of both these categories s99, being the first section in Div 2 states: 
     
      
       
        
        “99(1) This Division applies where:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a person has been acquitted of an offence, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) according to the rules of law relating to double jeopardy (including rules based on abuse of process), the person is thereby precluded or may thereby be precluded from being retried for the same offence, or from being tried for some other offence, in proceedings in this State. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) This section extends to a person acquitted in proceedings outside this State of an offence under the law of the place where the proceedings were held. However, this section does not so extend if the law of that place does not permit that person to be retried and the application of this Division to such a retrial is inconsistent with the Commonwealth Constitution or a law of the Commonwealth. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) This section extends to a person acquitted before the commencement of this Division.” 
        
       
      
    41 Section 99(3) is of significance for present purposes.  
     
      
    42 In the present appeal the Appellant relied on s107(8), set out above which, to repeat, states that the section does not apply to a person who is acquitted before the commencement of the section. The Appellant submits that the Parliament, having turned its mind to the question of retrospectivity, made provision in s107(8) which was intended to comprehensively state the circumstances in which the Act did not operate retrospectively. In my opinion, no such inference is available. 
     
      
    43 Section 107(8) applies to all appeals on questions of law pursuant to Div 3 of Pt 8, being the three categories identified in s107(1). Section 107(8) is, in my opinion, inserted in this legislative scheme by way of express contrast with s99(3). Because Div 2 does expressly apply to persons already acquitted, it was thought advisable to expressly provide that Div 3 does not so apply. This limited purpose does not, however, indicate that an inference is available that an appeal may lie in any case in which an accused had not been acquitted at the time of coming into force of the 2006 Amendment Act. Such an implication would, in my opinion, offend the clear statement principle.  
     
      
    44 The process of inference upon which the Appellant must rely in this respect is not available in a case where legislation has impinged upon a fundamental principle of the common law. Clearly there is nothing express. Nor is there any “necessary” implication. The language is neither “unmistakeable” nor “unambiguous”. Nor are any of the other formulations of the clear statement principle, to which Parliament clearly had regard with respect to this very Act, capable of being satisfied. 
     
      
    45 The common law presumption against retrospectivity is not spent when it is clear that Parliament intended a statute to operate retrospectively to some degree. Such a statute will only be given retrospective operation to the extent necessitated by the words of the statute, construed in their full context and in accordance with the legislative purpose, but to no greater extent. (See Reid v Reid (1886) 31 Ch D 402 at 408-409; Lauri v Renad (1892) 3 Ch 402 at 421 and Attorney-General (NSW) v World Best Holdings Ltd [2005] NSWCA 261; 63 NSWLR 557 at [48].) 
     
      
    46 This approach should be applied with particular stringency when, as here, the allegedly retrospective legislation modifies a fundamental principle of the criminal justice process. The doubt I expressed in World Best at [50]-[51] about the formulations in Zainal bin Hashim v Government of Malaysia [1980] AC 73 at 242 and State of Victoria v Robertson [2000] 1 VR 465 at 471 [21] may not be applicable in such a context. 
     
      
    47 The issue before this Court is closely analogous to that before the High Court in Newell v The King supra, where the Court was concerned with whether or not Tasmanian legislation, which introduced provisions for a majority verdict, had retrospective operation to criminal proceedings. The legislation, as Dixon J put it: “ … should be taken to mean on the trial of any criminal issue joined after the commencement of the Act.” (Newell supra at 712 and see the identical formulation of Evatt J at 714.)  
     
      
    48 In the present proceedings, although the Appellant was re-arraigned in the Supreme Court after the Act presently under consideration came into force, the relevant “criminal issue” had been “joined” in the District Court well before the commencement of the Act. 
     
      
    49 Furthermore, the two trials in the District Court and the trial in this Court were part of one proceeding for the same offence. (See Cornwell v The Queen [2007] HCA 12; 81 ALJR 840 at [88].) 
     
      
    50 For this reason alone the appeal in the present case should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      The Notice of Appeal Issue 
       
      
    51 The Respondent contends that the Appellant failed to file a valid Notice of Appeal within the period of 28 days provided for in s107(3) and, accordingly, that the appeal is out of time. It also submits that leave to appeal out of time should not be granted.  
     
      
    52 The Appellant accepts that the Respondent filed in Court a document purporting to be a Notice of Appeal within the 28 day period, but submits that the document was not a Notice of Appeal within the meaning of the Act. He directed attention to two matters in the document filed at that time. First, the Notice was expressed in the following terms: “I desire to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against directed acquittals by her Honour Justice Fullerton …”. Secondly, the Notice stated that the appeal was said to be “On the ground that her Honour erred in a question of law”, without further detail. 
     
      
    53 As to the first matter, the Respondent relied on the terminology of s107(1)(a) which states that the section “applies to the acquittal of a person … by a jury at the direction of the trial judge”. He submits that the Notice failed to identify the “correct verdict being appealed against”, which should have been against “the acquittal … by a jury at the direction of the trial judge”, rather than “directed acquittals by her Honour Justice Fullerton”. 
     
      
    54 This submission should be rejected. Section 107(1) identifies the circumstances in which the other provisions of s107 apply. The operative provision is s107(2) which is to the effect that either the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions “may appeal … against any such acquittal”. In my opinion, the reference in the original Notice of Appeal to “directed acquittals by her Honour Justice Fullerton” should be understood as “acquittals directed by her Honour” and, so understood, refers to an “acquittal … by a jury at the direction” of the judge. 
     
      
    55 As to the second matter, the original Notice of Appeal referred to an appeal “on a question of law”. It did not employ the terminology of s107(2) i.e. a “question of law alone”. However, this is not the gravamen of the complaint by the Respondent. He relies on the failure to identify in any way the question of law said to be involved in a “ground”.  
     
      
    56 In the present case her Honour had decided two questions of law with respect to each of the two counts on the indictment. In the event, as became clear only at the hearing of this appeal, the Appellant did not intend to appeal from the directed verdict with respect to the attempt charge. More significantly, the Appellant, in its original Notice, failed to identify any question of law. Subsequently, such grounds, said to involve a question of law alone, were supplied and leave to amend the Notice of Appeal is sought. I will consider this application under the heading “The Question of Law Issue” below. 
     
      
    57 A Notice of Appeal serves three functions. 
     
      
       
        
        1 It invests the appellate court with jurisdiction; 
         
         
        2 It identifies and, subject to permitted amendment, confines the issues which the appellate court must determine; and 
         
         
        3 It provides notice to the Respondent of the case he, she or it must meet. 
        
       
      
    58 The formulation in the original Notice of Appeal was “appeal … against directed acquittals by her Honour Justice Fullerton” which, as I have explained above, properly understood invoked the formulation in s107(2), save for its failure to identify a “ground that involves a question of law alone”.  
     
      
    59 Plainly, the second and third functions of a Notice, which I have identified above, were not performed by the original Notice. That subsequently happened when a particularised form of Notice was filed, with respect to which leave to amend is sought, as discussed below. 
     
      
    60 In my opinion, there was no denial of procedural fairness. Indeed, save with respect to the uncertainty as to whether or not the appeal applied to both counts on the original indictment, the Respondent could have been in no doubt as to the question of law in issue. There was only one question of law decided by her Honour and the Respondent could have been in no doubt as to the issue which the Appellant sought to raise by way of appeal.  
     
      
    61 Nor, in view of the detailed Notice subsequently filed, and the extensive written submissions, was this Court unaware of the issue of interpretation sought to be raised on the appeal in adequate time for the hearing. 
     
      
    62 This leaves the function of conferring jurisdiction. That issue is whether it was sufficient to invest this Court with jurisdiction to assert that there was an error on a question of law, without more. 
     
      
    63 Where, as here, the relevant section expressly provides for an extension of time to lodge an appeal beyond the time stipulated, it is plain the Parliament did not intend that a failure to comply with the time stipulation was such as to affect the validity of the Notice as a document conferring jurisdiction on the Court. It cannot be said that the legislature intended that failure to comply with the stipulation as to time was such as to render invalid conduct done in breach of the stipulation. (See Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 esp at 388-390 [91], [93].) Nothing turns on the slight difference in terminology between the two formulations in that case. (See World Best Holdings supra at [105]-[109].) 
     
      
    64 Where the Court can grant leave to appeal after the expiry of the time stipulated, there is no reason to conclude that Parliament intended that a purported Notice of Appeal should be regarded as invalid and, accordingly, incapable of effectively invoking the jurisdiction which it purported to invoke, by reason of a failure to identify matters that should have been identified. 
     
      
    65 As long ago as 1880, at a time when such technical points were often successful, Field J said in R v Hutchins (1880) 5 QBD 353 at 357: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not think that grounds of appeal ought be construed as pleadings. The books are full of the finest points with regard to the construction of grounds of removal and appeal, but I hope the days for such subtleties has gone by. … [I]f an amendment was necessary, it ought be made. I think the power of amendment ought to be exercised, where the other party is not unjustly prejudiced by the amendment. Here the point having been taken before the magistrates, the respondents knew that it would be raised on the appeal.” 
        
       
      
    66 In the present case no rules or regulations have been made with respect to the requirements of an appeal under Pt 8 of the Act. The Criminal Appeal Rules are directed to regulating appeals against conviction and sentence pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. There is no formal requirement as to the form and content of a document instituting an appeal under the Act presently under consideration. 
     
      
    67 The issue before this Court does not involve any need to analyse the specific terminology of court rules. (C/f State of Victoria v Bacon (1998) 4 VR 269 at 286-289.) The issue is whether it is sufficient, in order to invest this Court with jurisdiction, to assert that there is an error involving a question of law, or whether it is necessary to identify the question with some precision. 
     
      
    68 In my opinion, the former is sufficient for purposes of investing the Court with jurisdiction. The latter is required, at some stage, to serve the other functions of a Notice of Appeal. 
     
      
    69 If I had come to a different conclusion, I would have had no difficulty in granting leave to file out of time a Notice which would rectify any failure to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court. Indeed, that would, if it were necessary, be the consequence of granting the leave sought to file an amended Notice, to which I now turn. 
     
      
       
      The Question of Law Issue 
       
      
    70 As noted above, s107(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act restricts an appeal to this Court from an acquittal to a “ground that involves a question of law alone”. The Respondent contends that the Notice of Appeal as filed, and as sought to be amended, does not identify a “question of law alone”. For the reasons below, leave should be granted to the Appellant to amend its Notice of Appeal, but only with respect to proposed grounds 2 and 3. 
     
      
    71 The draft amended Notice of Appeal for which the Appellant seeks leave is in the following form: 
     
      
       
        
        “I, Damian Bugg AM QC, Director of Public Prosecutions for the Commonwealth of Australia appeal against the acquittal of the respondent, … on the first count in the indictment, by a jury in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 18 April 2007, at the direction of the trial judge, here Honour Justice Fullerton, on the grounds that her Honour’s directions involve a question of law alone. 
        
       
       
        
        Statement of the grounds for appeal 
        
       
       
        
        Her Honour’s direction to the jury to acquit the respondent involved the questions of law alone referred in paragraphs 1 – 5 below and errors in respect of those questions. 
        
       
       
        
        1. Her Honour erred: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in rejecting the submission recorded at paragraph 23 of the judgment; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in her analysis (in paragraph 23) of that submission. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. Her Honour erred in expressing the view stated in the first sentence of paragraph 38 of the judgment. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Her Honour erred in expressing the view that the words of section 39 of the Crimes Act 1914 and the declared operation of the Criminal Code as provided in the provisions of Chapter 2, require the prosecution to prove that an accused knew that the proceedings in which the evidence may be required were or are ‘Federal judicial proceedings’ (see para 39 of the judgment). 
        
       
       
        
        4. Her Honour erred in concluding that on a proper construction of section 39 of the Crimes Act 1914, the Crown must prove that the accused knew that the data may be required in ‘Federal judicial proceedings’ (see para 42 of the judgment). 
        
       
       
        
        5. In a proceeding for a breach of section 39 of the Crimes Act 1914, all that the Crown must prove, so far as concerns the accused’s knowledge of the type of the possible judicial proceedings, is that the accused knew certain facts. But those facts must be such as to have enabled as a matter of law, a proceeding to be instituted: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in or before a federal court, court exercising federal jurisdiction or a court of a Territory; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) before a body or person acting under the law of the Commonwealth, or of a Territory, in which evidence may be taken on oath.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    72 I have set out at pars [15] - [17] above pars [23], [38], [39] and [42] of the judgment of Fullerton J to which reference is made in proposed grounds 1 to 4. 
     
      
    73 The Notice does contain some distracting words which are best omitted. The last clause should read, with deletions identified: “On the grounds that her Honour’s directions involve a question of law alone”. However this is mere surplusage. 
     
      
    74 Plainly, the formulation “a question of law alone” is more restrictive than the formulation “a question of law”. Furthermore, the terminology “question of law” is not equivalent to “error of law”. Nevertheless, at least by way of particularisation, it is necessary for a Notice of Appeal to identify the “question of law alone” said to be involved in specific grounds for appeal. Such questions of particularisation do not involve a rigid requirement. In the present case it was at all times tolerably clear what, at least with respect to the first count on the indictment, the relevant question of law must be. 
     
      
    75 Nevertheless, it is a requirement of a Notice of Appeal in this context that the specific “question of law alone” said to arise should be identified with reasonable precision.  
     
      
    76 Grounds 1 to 4 in the proposed amended Notice of Appeal all employ the formulation “her Honour erred”. This is a common formulation for identifying a “ground” of appeal for purposes of s107(2).  
     
      
    77 Save in so far as there is an interconnection between grounds 1 and 2 and the legal issue identified in grounds 3 and 4, I am unable to identify any question of law ‘involved’ in grounds 1 and 2. Matters of this character should not be left to a process of inference and leave to amend to rely on grounds 1 and 2 should be refused. 
     
      
    78 Similarly, ground 5 is, as the Respondent contended, not a question of law at all, but is more in the nature of a submission.  
     
      
    79 There does not appear to me to be any material difference between grounds 3 and 4. They appear to raise the same issue, being the proper interpretation of s39 of the Crimes Act 1914 in the light of s31 of that Act and the operation of Ch 2 of the Criminal Code. The difference between “expressing the view” referred to in ground 3 and “concluding” in ground 4 does not appear to me to be material. Nevertheless, in each case the reference is surplusage. It would be best to approach each of grounds 3 and 4 as if they commenced, respectively: “Whether the words of s39 …” and “Whether on a proper construction …”. 
     
      
    80 The Respondent submitted that the grounds in the proposed amended Notice of Appeal involved a mixed question of fact and law and were accordingly not “a question of law alone” as established in Williams v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 278 at 287, 301 and 314. The direction to the jury, the Appellant submitted, was based on the combined effect of her Honour’s interpretation and the absence of evidence as to the accused’s knowledge that any proceedings were federal judicial proceedings, within the definition of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    81 The application of the reasoning in Williams supra, to the formulation in s107 of the Act is by no means clear. The Criminal Code of Tasmania, which established the right of appeal from an acquittal under consideration in Williams, was different from the recent New South Wales statute. The Tasmanian provision referred to an appeal by leave “against an acquittal on a question of law alone”. The New South Wales provision is more expansive in its reference to “against any … acquittal on any ground that involves a question of law alone”. The reference to the ‘involvement’ of a “question of law alone” in a “ground” is wider than the use of the word “on” in the Tasmanian statute.  
     
      
    82 In any event, Williams is distinguishable. The issue there under consideration concerned the discretionary exclusion of evidence. That is quite different from what happened in the present case, which involved separate steps. The first was her Honour’s determination of the proper construction of the statutory offence. The second was her Honour’s determination, on that construction, that there was no evidence capable of supporting the charge. This was not a mixed question of fact and law. There was a question of law, followed by a question of mixed law and fact. 
     
      
    83 The interpretation of the provision was the relevant, indeed determinative, step and that step does answer the description of a “question of law alone”. Accordingly, the words “such acquittal” in s107(2), which must be read relevantly as stating “acquittal by a jury at the direction of the trial judge”, did involve a question of law alone. 
     
      
    84 The Respondent’s submissions in this respect should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      The Constitutional Issue 
       
      
    85 The Respondent contends that s80 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, requiring trials on indictment to be by jury, has the consequence that it is impermissible to enact legislation applicable to Commonwealth offences which qualified the finality of an acquittal following a verdict of not guilty by a jury. This issue turns on whether or not the finality of a verdict of acquittal is an essential characteristic of trial by jury within the meaning of s80. (See Cheatle v The Queen (1993) 177 CLR 541 esp at 557-558; Brownlee v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 278 esp at 284 [5] and 288-289 [21]; Ng v The Queen (2003) 217 CLR 521 at [9]. See also the article by A W Scott “Trial by Jury and the Reform of Civil Procedure” (1918) 31 Harvard Law Review 669 at 671 quoted in Brownlee at 298.) However, as has been recognised in the authorities, the procedures with respect to the jury system have never been immutable, (see e.g. Brownlee supra at 286 [12]), and not all traditional incidents of trial by jury are essential (see e.g. Brownlee supra at [24]-[27], [54]-[67], [189]-[192]). 
     
      
    86 The Court received detailed submissions from the Respondent and also from the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth intervening, with respect to the issue of essentiality, drawing on both the historical context and relevant case law. I do not find it necessary to deal with the detail of these submissions. This is because the issue before the Court has been the subject of express determination by another intermediate Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Sung Bo Kim (1993) 65 A Crim R 278, where submissions of the present character were expressly rejected in their application to the provisions of the Criminal Code of Tasmania, which has long permitted appeals from an acquittal.  
     
      
    87 This decision invokes the principle identified in the joint judgment of the High Court in Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Limited (1993) 177 CLR 485 at 492, where the Court indicated that, in the case of uniform national legislation, and of course all the more so in the case of the Constitution itself, an intermediate appellate court should generally follow another Australian intermediate appellate court, unless convinced that the interpretation is “plainly wrong”. The Respondent accepted that this test applied to the issue in the present proceedings and sought to convince the Court that the reasoning of the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal was plainly wrong in the requisite sense. 
     
      
    88 Sung Bo Kim was decided prior to Cheatle, the origins of contemporary jurisprudence on the interpretation of s80 of the Constitution. Nevertheless, it drew on reasoning in the split decision of the High Court in Snow supra with respect to the very issue of whether or not s80 permitted an appeal from an acquittal. 
     
      
    89 Green CJ concluded that Snow was not authority for the proposition that s80 prevented the institution of an appeal from an acquittal by a jury at 279-280. His Honour concluded at 280: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [A]lthough there are principles or presumptions which militate against construing statutes so that they confer a right of appeal against acquittals they do not derive their validity from any special rule relating to trial by jury but from other more general common law principles. Thus whilst no doubt the effect of s80 is to preclude the enactment of a statute which gives a court of appeal the power to substitute a verdict of guilty for an acquittal there is no reason to conclude that it precludes the enactment of a statute conferring a power to review acquittals and order a new trial.” 
        
       
      
    90 Furthermore, in Sung Bo Kim Zeeman J analysed the judgments in Snow in some detail and agreed that it was not authority for the proposition that one of the concomitants of trial by jury within s80 was the absence of appeal against a verdict of acquittal. His Honour concluded at 285: 
     
      
       
        
        “Of the six justices who decided that case, three expressed opinions in support of that proposition and the other three expressed opinions to the contrary.” 
        
       
      
    91 His Honour concluded, after referring to The Queen v Kingswell (1985) 159 CLR 264 at 276-277, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “So long as the trial is by what may fairly be described as a jury and so long as any ultimate determination of guilt is by verdict of a jury, it cannot be said that the provisions of s80 are offended.” [p286] 
        
       
      
    92 In my opinion, the conclusion of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Tasmania in Sung Bo Kim is reasonably open. Furthermore, the analysis of the judgments of the High Court in Snow also appears to me to be accurate. Accordingly, this Court must apply the test in Marlborough Gold Mines set out above to a situation in which there is a reasoned judgment of an intermediate Court of Appeal drawing upon reasoning, precisely in point, of an equally divided High Court. In my opinion, the test in Marlborough Gold Mines cannot be satisfied in such circumstances. This Court ought to follow the reasoning of the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal and leave it to the High Court to redetermine this issue if thought appropriate. 
     
      
       
      The  
      Judiciary Act 
       Issue 
       
      
    93 In the alternative to its reliance on s80 of the Constitution, the Respondent contended that s68(2) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) does not pick up and apply provisions of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 which permit appeals from an acquittal. That section relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “68(2) The several courts of a State or Territory exercise in jurisdiction with respect to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the trial and conviction on indictment; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        of offenders or persons charged with offences against the laws of the State or Territory,  
        and with respect to the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of any such trial or conviction or out of proceedings connected therewith 
        , shall, subject to this section and to section 80 of the Constitution, have the like jurisdiction with respect to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth.” 
        
       
      
    94 The Respondent invokes the case law, which I have discussed above in the context of the retrospectivity issue, establishing the principle of legality and the principle of clear statement with respect to the modification of fundamental common law principles. The Appellant specifically refers to the application of these principles to a statute creating an appeal from an acquittal by a jury, relying on the analysis in Snow and Cheng, to which I have referred above, and Thompson v Mastertouch TV Service Pty Ltd (No 3) (1978) 38 FLR 397. 
     
      
    95 This is also a matter considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal of Tasmania in Sung Bo Kim. The respondent in that case relied on the observations of Deane J in Thompson v Mastertouch supra esp at 412-413, which were approved in the judgments of the High Court in Davern v Messel (1984) 155 CLR 21, although the majority of the Court in that case did not apply them to the provisions of the Federal Court of Australia Act (1976) there under consideration. The Respondent in Sung Bo Kim had submitted that these particular statements of the clear statement principle and of the principle of legality were such that the Court of Criminal Appeal of Tasmania should not follow its earlier judgment in R v Sender (1982) 7 A Crim R 344. In Sender the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth appealed against an acquittal pursuant to provisions of the Tasmanian Criminal Code permitting such an appeal. 
     
      
    96 In Sender, as in this case, the respondent submitted that the words of s68(2), which I have italicised above, were enacted consequent upon the judgment of the High Court in Seagg v The King (1932) 48 CLR 251 and should be interpreted as doing no more than overcoming that specific decision. 
     
      
    97 Secondly, the respondent in Sender submitted that to permit s68(2) to pick up the then unique provisions of the Tasmanian Criminal Code, providing for an appeal from an acquittal, would lead to “anomalous differences between the States in the administration of the criminal law” (at p346).  
     
      
    98 Thirdly, the respondent in that case submitted that to so interpret s68(2) would be to “violate … a well established principle that prima facie no appeal should lie against an acquittal” (at p346).  
     
      
    99 The Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal rejected these submissions. 
     
      
    100 With respect to the first submission the Court accepted that the additional words were added to s68(2) in response to the judgment in Seagg, but determined that they could not be limited to curing the specific issue that arose in that case (pp346-347). Indeed, the words go further than required by that judgment. 
     
      
    101 Secondly, with respect to the alleged anomaly, the judgments in Sender rejected the proposition that differences amongst the States was in any way “anomalous” (p347). Their Honours concluded that the formulation by Dixon J in The Queen v Williams (No 2) (1934) 50 CLR 551 at 560, of the correct approach to the interpretation of the Judiciary Act in the directly relevant respect, had been approved by the majority of the High Court in The Queen v Peel (1971) 125 CLR 447. See at 468 per Gibbs J, whom Menzies, Windeyer and Owen agreed at 457 and 460.  
     
      
    102 In Williams Dixon J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [T]he general policy disclosed by the enactment, namely, to place the administration of the criminal law of the Commonwealth in each State upon the same footing as that of the State and to avoid the establishment of two independent systems of criminal justice.” 
        
       
       
      (See also per Rich J at 558.)  
       
       
      I accept that this statement should be accepted as authoritatively determining an issue that had previously divided the High Court. 
       
      
    103 Accordingly, the Court in Sender rejected the proposition that the clear statement principle should lead to the conclusion that the Commonwealth Parliament did not intend, when enacting the Judiciary Act, or when amending s68(2) in the wake of Seagg’s case, to interfere with the fundamental common law principle concerning the finality of a jury acquittal. Subsequent authorities have accepted that this result flowed from the majority in Peel. (See e.g. Rohde v Director of Public Prosecutions (1986) 161 CLR 119 at 130, 136-137.) The validity of the approach of Dixon J in Williams has been confirmed in the joint judgment in The Queen v Murphy (1985) 158 CLR 596 at 617 and in The Queen v Gee (2003) 212 CLR 230 at [6]-[7], [57], [63]-[64], [134]-[137] and [180]-[186]. 
     
      
    104 Green CJ concluded that this presumption of the law of statutory interpretation did not apply. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 68(2) does not itself define what rights of appeal are vested in parties to criminal proceedings arising out of breaches of Commonwealth law. All section 68(2) does is to define the classes of State legislation which are to apply to such proceedings and there is no suggestion that the draftsmen intended that section 68(2) should operate selectively depending on whether the laws of the State in which the proceedings took place satisfied some criteria of acceptability derived from the common law or elsewhere. The only question in each case is whether the particular jurisdiction which is being invoked falls into one of the categories referred to in section 68(2) and it is not appropriate to apply the principle or presumption relied on by the respondent to the determination of that issue.” 
        
       
      
    105 His Honour went on to say that, in any event, the presumption would be displaced by the approach to the interpretation of the Judiciary Act identified by Dixon J in Williams, as approved subsequently in Peel.  His Honour also invoked the similar view expressed by Mason J in Ex parte Blacklock (1974) 131 CLR 338 at 345.  
     
      
    106 The other members of the Court gave reasons to similar effect (see at 355, 362-363). Specifically, with respect to the invocation by the respondent in Sender of the reasoning of Griffiths CJ in Snow supra at 322, Cox J said at 366-367: 
     
      
       
        
        “Legislation passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1932 conferring rights of appeal on the parties to the trial was enacted in the knowledge that the legislature in the State of Tasmania had in fact conferred such a right on its law officers eight years previously and that the legislatures of all the other States had like power to do so if and when they chose to.” 
        
       
      
    107 With respect to the principle of clear statement, as applied to the interference with a fundamental principle of the common law involved in establishing a right to appeal from a jury acquittal, Cox J said, referring to the amendment of the Judiciary Act in 1932 after Seagg’s case at 367: 
     
      
       
        
        “But the legislature in 1932 was not overthrowing fundamental principles or departing from the general system of law, but rather adopting the system of administering the criminal law in each State in respect of all proceedings connected with offences against Commonwealth laws conducted in each State.” 
        
       
      
    108 This is a clear application of the principle advanced by Dixon J in Williams as approved by the majority in Peel. 
     
      
    109 When the matter was raised again in Sung Bo Kim, Zeeman J, with whom Green CJ and Wright J agreed, rejected a similar submission based on the reasoning of Deane J in Thompson v Mastertouch as approved in Davern v Messel and applied the reasoning of Cox J in Sender at pp287-288. 
     
      
    110 In my opinion, although the judgments in Sender and Sung Bo Kim may have given too much emphasis to the existence of the specific provision of the Tasmanian Criminal Code, they nevertheless came to the correct conclusion as to the approach to s68(2) of the Judiciary Act. Subsequent authorities are to the same effect. (See e.g. Leeth v The Commonwealth (1992) 174 CLR 455 at 467; Gee supra 230 at [6]-[7], [63]-[64]: Putland v The Queen (2004) 218 CLR 174 at [71].) 
     
      
    111 The dominant purpose of this, and of other provisions of the Judiciary Act, is to ensure that, subject to identified restrictions, persons accused of crimes under State legislation should be subject to the same incidents of trial as persons accused of crimes under Commonwealth legislation. That is a distinct policy choice made by the Commonwealth Parliament. It could have easily made the choice that, in all relevant respects, the incidents of a trial for a Commonwealth offence should be uniform throughout Australia. It has not, or at least not yet, made any such determination.  
     
      
    112 As Gleeson CJ said in Gee supra at [7]: 
     
      
       
        
        “That general policy reflects a legislative choice between distinct alternatives: having a procedure for the administration of criminal justice in relation to federal offences that is uniform throughout the Commonwealth; or relying on State courts to administer criminal justice in relation to federal offences and having uniformity within each State as to the procedure for dealing with State and federal offences. The choice was for the latter. The federal legislation enacted to give effect to that choice, therefore, had to accommodate not only differences between State procedures at any given time, but also future changes to procedures in some States that might not be adopted in others. That explains the use of general and ambulatory language, and the desirability of giving that language a construction that enables it to pick up procedural changes and developments as they occur in particular States from time to time.” 
        
       
       
      (See also at [13]; McHugh and Gummow JJ at [63]-[64] and Callinan J at [182].) 
       
      
    113 The dominant purpose served by, relevantly, s68(2), is of sufficient strength to override the applicability of other principles of statutory interpretation that may otherwise be drawn on. It is the existence and strength of a purpose of this character that satisfies, in the particular circumstances, the requirements of the clear statement principle. 
     
      
    114 The Judiciary Act cannot be interpreted as if it were another piece of legislation. It deserves to be approached as a special Act, just as the Constitution cannot be interpreted like any other statute. All of the principles of the law of interpretation must be applied with an understanding of the nature of the document that is being interpreted. The Constitution of Australia is a written constitution. However, like the British Constitution, a number of Australian statutes have constitutional significance and their interpretation should be approached with that consideration in mind.  
     
      
    115 The Judiciary Act is legislation of a quasi constitutional character. Its purpose includes the purpose of ensuring that accused persons in each State are, with defined exceptions, the subject of incidents of a criminal trial which are the same for Commonwealth offences as they are for State offences. This is a purpose of overriding significance and is sufficient to displace the application of principles of statutory interpretation which lead the Court to read down general words to conform with principles which Parliament is presumed to respect. (As discussed in cases such as Bropho and Coco referred to above.) 
     
      
    116 As Dixon J said of the Judiciary Act in Williams supra at 561: 
     
      
       
        
        “General words adopting an existing set of provisions of State law appear to me to be of a different order from general words which are not referential, but deal independently with the subject matter.” 
        
       
      
    117 After referring to an authority on the presumption against modification of common law rights, his Honour added at 561: 
     
      
       
        
        “But such a process of interpretation does not appear to me to be applicable to an enactment dealing with the existing and known provisions of a particular department of the statutory law of the States and by a general description adopted for a Federal purpose. Whatever, upon the natural meaning of the language falls within the description should, I think, be understood as within the legislative intention.” 
        
       
      
    118 In any event, the application of the principle in Marlborough Gold Mines requires this Court to follow the reasoning of the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal in both Sender and Sung Bo Kim. Other intermediate courts of appeal have adopted the same approach. (See e.g. R v Walsh (1984) 3 NSWLR 584 at 588; Bagshaw v Carter [2006] NSWCA 113 at [28].) 
     
      
    119 It may be that the views expressed in Sender at 366 that an appeal against acquittal does not arise “out of any proceedings connected with the trial” is wrong. (See Byrnes v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 1 at [51] approving Barwick CJ in Peel supra at 454.) However, an appeal under s107 of the Act is an appeal “arising out of any such trial” and within the words added to s68(2) after Seagg. (See Sender at 365-366.) The jurisdiction to consider a question of law reserved, upheld in Gee supra, is not, in my opinion, distinguishable. The Respondent’s contentions should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      The Criminal Code Issue 
       
      
    120 I have set out above the statutory provisions, and her Honour’s analysis thereof, on the basis of which she determined that, as a matter of interpretation, it was necessary for the Crown to prove that the Respondent knew the destroyed documentation was to be used in evidence in a judicial proceeding which bore the particular characteristic of a federal proceeding. I have also set out at par [19] above the Appellant’s contentions in this Court with respect to the interpretation of s39 of the Crimes Act, in the light of the provisions of the Criminal Code. 
     
      
    121 As appears from the Appellant’s contentions, it accepts that the element of the offence requiring that the proceedings have the particular characteristic of a federal proceeding has to be established by the prosecution. However, it submits it is a question of law for the trial judge and not a question of fact for the jury. Accordingly, the Appellant contends, the only issue for the jury is whether or not an accused knows that the document said to have been destroyed may be required in evidence in litigation. It is not for the jury to determine whether or not the litigation involved a judicial proceeding with the characteristic of a federal proceeding, including with respect to the fault element. 
     
      
    122 The determination of whether an element of an offence constitutes a question of law or a question of fact sometimes raises difficult issues. (See e.g. R v Petroulias (2005) 62 NSWLR 663 esp at [12]-[15] and [123]-[132] and Sood v R [2006] NSWCCA 114 at [30], [138] and [132]-[134].) Such difficulties were not considered in the submissions to this Court.  
     
      
    123 The Appellant referred to Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 395, which affirmed the long established proposition that the meaning of a technical legal term is a question of law. Although the references to “a federal court” or the “court of a Territory” in s31 of the Crimes Act may not be such a term, the relevant reference to “a court exercising federal jurisdiction” is a highly technical legal term. 
     
      
    124 The issue must be approached, as Fullerton J did, from the particular perspective of the interpretation of the Criminal Code.  
     
      
    125 By force of s3.1(1) of the Criminal Code, the terminology of s39 of the Crimes Act, as expanded by the definition in s31 of that Act, must be divided into “physical elements” and “fault elements”. In the present case, the physical element of “a judicial proceeding”, and the particular character of such proceeding as a federal proceeding, constitute a “circumstance in which conduct” i.e. the alleged involvement in the destruction of information, occurred. (See s4.1(1)(c) of the Code.) 
     
      
    126 In its submissions to this Court the Appellant sought to draw a distinction between different kinds of elements of an offence. It invoked a distinction between “substantive” and “definitional” characteristics of a physical element of an offence, suggested by the author of a text on the Code. (See Stephen Odgers Principles of Federal Criminal Law, Law Book Co, Sydney, (2007) at p22 par 4.1.390.) It also invoked a similar distinction, drawn by the author of another text, between “facts” and “statutory references or designations”. (See Attorney-General’s Department The Commonwealth Criminal Code: A Guide for Practitioners, Canberra, March 2002, p119.)  
     
      
    127 I do not think it is open, when construing a Code, to decide that there are elements of an offence that are merely “definitional” or “referential” in such manner as to permit the words used in the formulation of the offence to be set aside. The very breadth of the definition of “physical element”, encompassing as it does anything capable of answering the description of a “circumstance”, indicates that all of the words of a statutory offence to which the Criminal Code applies must be given force and effect.  
     
      
    128 Accordingly, in the present case the characterisation of the proceedings as ‘federal’ must be accepted to be either a component part of the single circumstance of judicial proceeding or a separate circumstance. In either event, the issue has to be determined as to whether or not the fault element of knowledge expressed in s39 applies to that circumstance.  
     
      
    129 A Commonwealth offence to which the Criminal Code applies must, by reason of the nature of the Code, be approached on the basis that it comprehensively states each of the elements of a criminal offence. That is the central purpose of adopting a Code. The Criminal Code assumes that it is apparent on the face of the offence, as interpreted in the light of the Criminal Code, precisely what are the physical elements of an offence and to precisely which of those physical elements a fault element, if any, attaches and what that fault element is.  
     
      
    130 As I have noted above, s3.1(2) of the Criminal Code provides that the formulation of an offence may provide that there is no fault element for one or more physical elements. Any such provision must, in my opinion, be express and clear on the face of the statute. Otherwise the default fault element under s5.6 will apply. That was not done here.  
     
      
    131 Furthermore, a similar result could have been achieved by providing in the offence, again expressly, that the offence was one of absolute liability, at least with respect to the particular physical element of the offence constituted by the federal character of the requisite proceedings, for which express provision is made in cl 6.2(2) of the Criminal Code. Again, no such provision was made. 
     
      
    132 In 2001 the Parliament of the Commonwealth enacted the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001 (“the 2001 Amendment Act”) which reviewed the full range of Commonwealth legislation creating criminal offences and applied the general provisions of the Criminal Code to all of those offences. The 2001 Amendment Act bears on its face a lengthy process of detailed consideration, section by section, of each Commonwealth offence creating provision, with a view to determining precisely how the particular requirements of the Code should be adapted to each such offence. Schedule 10 of the 2001 Amendment Act was concerned with the Crimes Act 1914.  
     
      
    133 The particular provisions of Pt 3 of the Crimes Act concerned with “Offences Relating to the Administration of Justice”, in which both s31 and s39 appear, were considered section by section in cl 37 to cl 59 of Sch 10 of the 2001 Amendment Act. In some sections the words of pre-existing offences expressed in terms of “knowingly” or “wilfully” were replaced by the word “intentionally”. Furthermore, attention was given to the standard of liability required. Accordingly, the offence of giving false testimony with respect to a material matter, created by s35, was clarified by the insertion of an express s35(1)(A) which provides that strict liability applied to the physical element of circumstance constituted by the materiality of the matter.  
     
      
    134 This Court has not received detailed submissions on the application to the other sections of the Crimes Act to which resolution of the issue now before the Court will also necessarily apply i.e. s35 to s40 inclusive. These involve the fault element of intention (e.g. s35, s36, s38 and s40), often with respect to judicial proceedings that are already underway. The purpose of Pt 3 of the Crimes Act is to protect the administration of justice with respect to the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth by any court invested with federal jurisdiction and thereby to maintain the integrity of the administration of justice in that respect.  
     
      
    135 Of particular significance for present purposes is the amendment made in 2001 with respect to the offence of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. That offence was expressed in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “42(1) Any person who conspires with another to obstruct, prevent, pervert, or defeat, the course of justice in relation to the judicial power of the Commonwealth, shall be guilty of an indictable offence.” 
        
       
      
    136 The amendment in 2001 added the following subsection: 
     
      
       
        
        “42(2) For the purposes of an offence against subsection (1), absolute liability applies to the physical element of circumstance of the offence, that the judicial power is of the Commonwealth.” 
        
       
      
    137 An identical amendment was made, by the insertion of s43(2) in the same terms, with respect to the pre-existing offence in s43(1) concerning an attempt to pervert the course of justice. 
     
      
    138 It is clear, by the insertion of both s42(2) and s43(2), that the drafter of the 2001 Amendment Act had carefully considered the interconnection between the physical element constituted by the “circumstance” of “judicial power” and the fault element to be attached to that particular physical element.  
     
      
    139 The drafter of the amendments either did not accept or, acted out of an abundance of caution, so as to ensure that, in substance, no fault element attached to the physical element constituted by the fact that judicial power must be that of the Commonwealth. Fullerton J was correct to identify such express provision as making it more difficult for the Court to accept the Appellant’s submission that a similar result should ensue as a matter of interpretation for the whole group of immediately preceding provisions from s35 to s40 including, relevantly for present purposes, s39. 
     
      
    140 Whether by oversight or otherwise, no such specific provision was inserted with respect to the federal nature of the concept of “judicial proceeding”, established by the definition in s31, and which is terminology that applies to the prohibition on giving false testimony in s35, the prohibition on fabrication of evidence in s36, the prohibition of intimidation of witnesses in s36A, the prohibition on corruption of witnesses in s37, the prohibition on deception of witnesses in s38, the prohibition on destruction of evidence in s39 and the prohibition on preventing witnesses from attending court in s40. 
     
      
    141 The Appellant submitted that the 2001 legislation, which applied the Criminal Code to the relevant Crimes Act provisions did not intend to alter the operation of s39 from its prior operation at common law. The Appellant relied on express statements by the Minister in the Second Reading Speech and in the Explanatory Memorandum, asserting that no change was intended. Such assertions are rarely useful and often have been rejected in the course of interpretation by the courts.  
     
      
    142 The task of the courts is to interpret the words used by the Parliament. It is not to divine the intent of the Parliament. (See State v Zuma (1995) (4) BCLR 401 at 402; (1995) 2 SA 642; Matadean v Pointu [1999] 1 AC 98 at 108; R v PLV (2001) 51 NSWLR 736 at [82]; Pinder v The Queen [2003] 1 AC 620.) The distinction between interpretation and divination is an important one. The courts must determine what Parliament meant by the words it used. The courts do not determine what Parliament intended to say. (See R v Bolton ex parte Beane (1987) 162 CLR 514 at 518; Byrne & Frew v Australian Airlines Limited (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 459; Wik People v Queensland (1996) 187 CLR 1 at 168-169; R v Young (1999) 46 NSWLR 681 at [5]; Dossett v TKJ Nominees Pty Limited (2003) 218 CLR 1 at [10].) At times that will require the court to refuse to implement an express statement as to what the Parliamentary intention is. (As in R v Bolton ex parte Beane supra.) 
     
      
    143 Statements of the character that the drafter of the legislation did not intend to change the prior operation of the law are rarely, if ever, useful, let alone entitled to significant weight. Such an assertion makes two assumptions. First, that the author knows completely and precisely how the previous provision has been and will be applied. Secondly, that the author has stated the new provision with indisputable comprehensibility. Each assumption reflects a conceit to which drafters of texts are prone when appraising their own work. Each assumption is rarely, let alone generally, applicable. 
     
      
    144 In a context such as the present, where a comprehensive Code is being grafted onto pre-existing legislation, I find these statements of no use whatsoever for the purpose of interpretation. They should be regarded as aspirational. They may reflect the object of the detailed attention that had been given to every offence and its possible interconnection with the structure of the Code in the process of drafting the 2001 Amendment Act. Whether that aspiration was achieved remains a matter for interpretation.  
     
      
    145 Fundamental aspects of the law have been altered by the Criminal Code in substantial and indeed critical matters, by the replacement of a body of nuanced case law, which never purported to be comprehensive, with the comparative rigidity of a set of interconnecting verbal formulae which do purport to be comprehensive and which involve the application of a series of cascading provisions, including definitional provisions, expressed in language intended to be capable of only one meaning, which meaning does not necessarily reflect ordinary usage. 
     
      
    146 Reference to prior case law concerning the element of intent for particular criminal offences is, in my opinion, almost always likely to be a distraction. The changes in the fault requirements implemented by the Criminal Code, compared with the former requirements of mens rea at common law, are of so fundamental a character that, where one is concerned with fault, it is almost certainly futile to seek to determine what the position was at common law.  
     
      
    147 The Appellant contended that, prior to the enactment of the Criminal Code, the prosecution would not have had to establish that the accused knew that the judicial proceedings bore the character of a federal judicial proceeding. It appears that there have only ever been two prior prosecutions under s39 and it was not suggested that this issue arose. There is no adequate basis for a conclusion that no change in prior law was intended in this specific respect.  
     
      
    148 The Appellant may well be correct that the classification of the proceedings as a ‘federal proceeding’ would have raised a question of law for the judge and that the mens rea of the offence at common law did not require proof of knowledge of that characteristic. Even if correct, and it probably is, the proposition must now find a footing in the language of the Code. 
     
      
    149 The general approach to interpretation of the Code is well established. (See Bank of England v Vagliano Bros [1891] AC 107 esp at 144-145; Brennan v The King (1936) 55 CLR 253 esp at 263; Robinson v Canadian Pacific Railway Co [1892] AC 481 at 481-487; Vallance v The Queen (1961) 108 CLR 56 at 74-76; R v Barlow (1997) 188 CLR 1 esp at 18-19 and 31-32.) There may be occasions on which it is appropriate to refer to the common law, e.g. where the Code employs a technical legal term or where an interpretation is well established or in the case of patent ambiguity. (See e.g. Sungravure Pty Ltd v Middle East Airlines Airliban S.A.L. (1974) 134 CLR 1 at 22; Stuart v The Queen (1974) 134 CLR 426 at 437; Lee v R [2007] NSWCCA 71 at [19]-[26].) 
     
      
    150 When interpreting a Code all of the principles of statutory interpretation are applicable. The language used must be construed in its context. The fact that the Code creates criminal offences will often be determinative e.g. to decide that references to reasonable care import a standard of criminal negligence. This may be a specific example of patent ambiguity in a Code, arising when the words are construed, as they must be, in their context in the first instance and not merely after some ambiguity is discerned in the words of the specific offence. (CIC Insurance Limited v Bankstown Football Club Limited (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408; Project Blue Sky supra at [69].) 
     
      
    151 In the present case there is language with a technical legal meaning i.e. “federal jurisdiction”. However, there is no such language, nor any patent ambiguity, with respect to the fault element which must be found by the tribunal of fact to attach to the element so identified. 
     
      
    152 No provision of the Code states that a physical element which is a question of law for the judge cannot have attached to it a fault element which the jury must decide. The Code makes no direct distinction between questions of law and questions of fact. It does, however, make express provision for decoupling a specific physical element, relevantly a question of law, from any fault element. This can be done by either providing that no fault element applies to that physical element (under s3.1(2)) or by specifying that strict or absolute liability applies to the offence (under s6.1 or s6.2). Neither was done here. 
     
      
    153 The only foothold in the Code which the Appellant was able to invoke in the present case was s9.3, which it submitted, reflects the common law principle that it was not necessary to prove that a person had knowledge of the law. Nevertheless, it is also the case at common law that ignorance of the law may make it difficult for the prosecution to establish fault. 
     
      
    154 In my opinion, the Appellant’s reliance on s9.3 was misplaced. There is a distinction between knowing that proceedings have a federal character and knowing the terms of the definition in s31. Knowledge that a matter has a legal character is not equivalent to knowledge of the law. 
     
      
    155 Furthermore, section 9.3(1), set out above, is permissive in its terms: “A person can be criminally responsible …”. It extends, relevantly, to the “content of an Act that … affects the … operation of the offence”. Section 9.3(2) states, in terms, that “a person is not criminally responsible” if either the Act provides to the contrary or the ignorance “negates a fault element that applies to a physical element”. 
     
      
    156 In the present case, it appears to me that s39 and s31 of the Crimes Act provide to the contrary, probably expressly and, if not, then impliedly.  
     
      
    157 In any event, s9.3(2)(b) requires the court to determine what “fault element … applies to the physical element” being, relevantly, the federal character of the affected proceedings. That requires the Court to interpret s39 and s31 of the Crimes Act. The very circularity prevents s9.3 being applied as a basis for removing the fault element which attaches to a legal physical element from the jury, if the proper interpretation of the offence creating provision otherwise does attach it. 
     
      
    158 No doubt this interpretation will make the offence more difficult to prove. However, as Fullerton J concluded, the language is intractable. The structure of the offence creating provision does not permit separation of the federal character of the judicial proceeding from its character as a judicial proceeding with respect to the linkage to the reference to ‘knowledge’. 
     
      
    159 For the above reasons, even if I had been of a different opinion on the issue of retrospectivity, I would have dismissed the appeal from Fullerton J. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    160 It is not necessary to consider the discretionary and factual issues raised by the Respondent. 
     
      
    161 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        1 Leave granted to file the amended Notice of Appeal containing Grounds 2 and 3. 
         
         
        2 Appeal dismissed. 
        
       
      
    162 MASON P: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of the Chief Justice. I agree with his reasons and the orders proposed. I would add the following with reference to the s80 point. 
     
      
    163 The trial in the Supreme Court came to an end on 18 April 2007 when the jury gave directed verdicts of not guilty on the two counts in the indictment and Fullerton J discharged the respondent.  
     
      
    164 It is common ground in this Court that the trial was held in accordance with s80 of the Constitution, notwithstanding that the verdicts were given at the direction of the trial judge. A directed verdict of acquittal is a long-established method of bringing a jury trial to finality in such a way as to engage the autrefois acquit branch of the rule against double jeopardy. 
     
      
    165 The appeal does not engage the body of case law that permits proceedings to be regarded as a nullity because of non-compliance with a fundamental aspect of the concept of trial on indictment (see eg Crane v Director of Public Prosecutions [1921] 2 AC 299; Swansson v The Queen (2007) 168 A Crim R 263 , [2007] NSWCCA 67). 
     
      
    166 Section 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 allows the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal against an acquittal on a ground that involves a question of law alone. The Chief Justice demonstrates why this provision applies in this State with respect to federal matters by the operation of s68(2) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). The respondent submits that, in addition to the retrospectivity issue touching the instant trial, s80 of the Constitution would preclude s107 from being capable of applying with respect to the trial on indictment of federal offences. It is submitted that s80 of the Constitution prevents the Crown from appealing against a verdict of acquittal by a jury in a federal proceeding. 
     
      
    167 This aspect of the appeal is effectively on all fours with the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Tasmania in R v Kim (1993) 65 A Crim R 278. The Court there held that a Tasmanian statute allowing a prosecution appeal from an acquittal on a question of law was picked up by s68(2) of the Judiciary Act in federal jurisdiction and that s80 of the Constitution did not preclude this. Although the respondent submitted that this decision should not be followed, I perceive that it is our duty to so unless convinced it is plainly wrong (cf Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd (1993) 177 CLR 485 at 492 with respect to federal statutes). In fact, I agree with the Tasmanian decision. 
     
      
    168 Section 80 of the Constitution provides: 
     
      
       
        
        Trial by jury 
        
       
       
        
        The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes. 
        
       
      
    169 In Cheatle v The Queen (1993) 177 CLR 541, the High Court pointed out (at 549-1, 557-8) that the s80 reference to the common law institution of “trial by jury” guarantees that trial on indictment of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth will embody the ""essential"" features or attributes of that institution ""with all that was connoted by that phrase in constitutional law and in the common law of England"". Cheatle and later cases examined aspects of the process of jury trial such as requirements going to gender and composition (Cheatle at 560), minimum size and capacity to separate before verdict (Brownlee v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 278), the use of ""reserve” or ""additional"" jurors (Ng v The Queen (2003) 217 CLR 521) and the requirement of a unanimous verdict (Cheatle). 
     
      
    170 These considerations address the manner in which a jury is formed or goes about its business, in other words the processes of the trial itself. In the present case, as indicated, those processes were followed by both judge and jury in an unexceptionable manner down to verdict and acquittal.  
     
      
    171 This case poses the question whether the constitutional guarantee entrenches what is said to be the attribute of finality of the jury’s acquittal. As Mr Gleeson SC pointed out, the common law recognised that a verdict of acquittal could not be set aside by the trial judge, or challenged by any process of appeal or judicial review, or ignored by the launching of a fresh prosecution. These principles applied even where the verdict stemmed from judicial error in the form of a ruling on evidence or misdirection (see generally United States v Sanges (1892) 144 US 310 at 312; The King v Snow (1915) 20 CLR 315; Friedland M L, Double Jeopardy, Oxford Clarendon Press, 1969, Ch 10). 
     
      
    172 In Snow, the High Court recognised unanimously that the finality principle was an important aspect of the institution of trial by jury in the common (and constitutional) law of England. But the Court split 3:3 as to whether this had any bearing on s80. Griffith CJ (at 323) and Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ (at 363-5) considered the finality principle to be an aspect of the constitutional guarantee in s80, with the result that there could be no appeal directly to the High Court pursuant to s73 of the Constitution from a directed acquittal. By contrast, Isaacs J (at 351-2), Higgins J (at 353-4) and Powers J (at 367-8, 373) drew no such implication from s80. 
     
      
    173 I note (without expressing any conclusion on the matter) the analysis of Green CJ in Kim (at 279) where he suggests that of Griffith CJ’s reasoning in Snow was reinforced but not dependent on his view of the scope of s80.  
     
      
    174 It also may be that Isaacs J's reasoning is limited to a directed verdict stemming from judicial error, something that his Honour characterised as ""no real verdict"" (at 344, 346). There is authority in this State rejecting that part of Isaac J’s reasoning in Snow (see R v Lethlean (1995) 83 A Crim R 197 at 204).  
     
      
    175 In the final analysis it is unproductive to search for the ratio decidendi of individual judgments in Snow. The parties accept that the equal division of opinion about the scope of s80 precludes Snow from being a binding authority as to the scope of the constitutional guarantee. 
     
      
    176 I shall briefly state my reasons for preferring the narrower interpretation of s80 and why I would not depart from the similar ruling of the Tasmanian Full Court in Kim. 
     
      
    177 No one, to my understanding, disputes the proposition that a jury verdict of acquittal was ""final"" according to ancient common law in each of the senses referred to by Mr Gleeson SC. It would not be inapt to describe this as a principle of English ""constitutional"" law having regard to the role of the jury in the English polity (see The King v Weaver (1931) 45 CLR 321 at 356. See also the references to the ""constitutional"" role of the jury in Chidiac v The Queen (1994) 171 CLR 432 at 443 per Mason CJ and 454 per Dawson J and M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 502 per Brennan J). 
     
      
    178 The question whether there should be legislative reversal of this finality principle was under debate in England in the 1890s (see Rosemary Pattenden, English Criminal Appeals, 1844-1994 Oxford Clarendon Press, 1996, p285). The principle had been overturned by legislation in Canada in 1892 (see R v Morgentaler (1985) 22 CCC (3d) 353 at 400-402). But the common law prevailed in England and in the Australian colonies at federation. 
     
      
    179 Accepting the fundamental nature of the common law principles, the real issue is nevertheless the proper characterisation of those finality principles as at 1900. Were they an aspect or attribute of trial by jury? Or were they aspects of different common law principles related to double jeopardy or the absence of any right of appeal at common law? 
     
      
    180 My reasons for locating the finality principles outside the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury are threefold. 
     
      
    181 First, I see some support textually from the repeated references to ""trial"" in s 80. Section 80 spells out a “method” of trial (Brown v The Queen (1985) 160 CLR 171 at 202, 214) or a “mode of criminal procedure” (Brownlee at 284[6]). The section says nothing about how often that function may be performed, or the circumstances in which a new trial may be ordered. It is also silent as to the status of a verdict. 
     
      
    182 Secondly, I would adopt the reciprocity argument developed by Isaacs and Higgins JJ in Snow. If s80 connoted the common law's finality of an acquittal it would follow that it would connote the finality of a conviction, given that the common law knew no appeal against either outcome. In Higgins J's words (Snow at 354), ""in 1900, when our Constitution was passed into law, there was no appeal in English Courts from either conviction or acquittal."" No one suggests that s80 precludes statutory rights of appeal against conviction.  
     
      
    183 I do not think that the force of this argument is met by pointing to limited remedies available in the nineteenth century to challenge wrongful convictions (see Conway v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 203 at 208-217). The strenuous rearguard battle mounted by the English judiciary in the late nineteenth century against proposals to establish a Court of Criminal Appeal (Pattendon, op cit, pp22-25) included arguments that a prisoner’s right of appeal would undermine the finality of the currency of the jury’s verdict (of guilt). The currency of such arguments make it difficult to show that the framers of s80 would have been intending to take any position on the jury finality issue. 
     
      
    184 Thirdly, the United States experience as at the commencement of the Australian Constitution located finality principles touching a verdict of guilt or innocence within the American constitutional rules about double jeopardy, not within their constitutional rules about trial by jury in criminal matters. The founders of the Australian Constitution, who had before them the American model, chose to adopt a constitutional guarantee of trial by jury and decline a constitutional entrenchment of double jeopardy principles. 
     
      
    185 In developing this point I shall address the submissions based on United States constitutional law advanced by Mr Gleeson SC.  
     
      
    186 There were American Supreme Court decisions in the late 19th century rejecting any common law right of government appeal against a jury's acquittal (United States v Sanges (1892) 144 US 310; United States v Ball (1896) 163 US 662. See also United States v Wilson (1975) 420 US 332 at 336). These go no further than illustrating the common law situation in 1900. 
     
      
    187 Mr Gleeson relied upon Capital Traction Company v Hof (1899) 174 US 1 as representing the state of American law at the commencement of the Australian Constitution. However, Capital Traction does not assist the argument because that case involved a civil action. The United States Constitution provides in its Seventh Amendment that (emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
        In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved,  
        and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law. 
        
       
      
    188 The emphasised words go well beyond the simplicity of s80 in that they address the appellate consequences and methods of impugning a jury verdict in a civil action. In Capital Traction, the Supreme Court had no difficulty in construing those words as mandating compliance with the rules of the common law in England as regards the capacity to re-examine any fact tried by a jury in a civil action. The Court then proceeded to examine and apply those law rules (in Part II of the Opinion at 8-13). Mr Gleeson pointed to passages in Capital Traction (at 12-13) illustrating that the Seventh Amendment embodied a constitutional guarantee as regards the ""external impact"" (CCA Tr p25) of the jury's verdict. Quite so. But this was in relation to a civil action and it was the express language of the concluding portion of the Seventh Amendment that drove the whole of that Part of the Court's reasoning (see eg at 9.5, 13). 
     
      
    189 Mr Gleeson pointed to statements in Capital Traction (at 13-14, 16) recognising that a jury's acquittal on a criminal charge could not be set aside on the basis that the verdict was against the law and the evidence. One of those passages is quoted by Quick and Garran, Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth, p310. These dicta are found in a separate Part of the judgment (Part III) discussing the ""primary and usual sense of the term [‘trial by jury’] at common law"" (at 13). As such, the dicta may provide tangential support for the argument contending for the broader scope of s80 of the Australian Constitution. But Capital Traction was decided on 11 April 1899, over a year after the last of the Conventions that hammered out the terms of our Constitution. And the common law consequence of an acquittal to which the dicta refer is not, for the reasons above, the same as saying that this is within the scope of a constitutional guarantee of trial by jury framed with the sparcity of s80. 
     
      
    190 When the United States Supreme Court faced the issue squarely in 1904, it located the constitutional guarantee elsewhere than in the provision dealing with trial by jury in criminal matters. 
     
      
    191 In Kepner v United States (1904) 195 US 100 the Court held that the American Constitution prohibited government appeals authorised by statute. However, that prohibition was located in the Fifth Amendment (double jeopardy), not in Article III (trial by jury). This had a significance that was pointed out, namely that the constitutional incapacity to impugn an acquittal extended beyond a jury's verdict of acquittal to an acquittal entered upon the determination by a court on a question of law (see 195 US at 128-133). (Kepner was not cited to us, but since the appeal turns ultimately on other issues, I have not thought it necessary to seek further assistance of counsel on the matters that I derive from this decision.) 
     
      
    192 In Fong Foo v United States (1962) 369 US 141 a directed verdict of acquittal was challenged by Government petition for mandamus to the Court of Appeals from the First Circuit. The petition was granted. The United States Supreme Court set this order aside. Significantly, for present purposes, this was because reviewing the acquittal was found to violate the Constitution because it put the accused twice in jeopardy (see at 143). 
     
      
    193 The reasoning of the High Court in The Queen v Carroll (2002) 213 CLR 635 demonstrates that the doctrine of double jeopardy reflected in the pleas of autrefois convict and autrefois acquit are aspects of a wider principle precluding calling into question orders made upon the final determination of legal proceedings, especially determination of criminal proceedings by a verdict of acquittal (see per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J at 647[35], 651[48], per Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 662[91]-[93], per McHugh J at 675[137]-[138]). This extension of the autrefois rules does not, however, serve to relocate them within the sphere of s80. On the contrary. The preclusion discussed in Carroll operated by reference to the final outcome of the criminal process (acquittal), not the mode whereby it came about. The accused in Carroll had been convicted by a jury but he was acquitted on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal of Queensland. In this sense, Carroll is reflective of the approach taken by the United Stated Supreme Court in Kepner.

    JUDGMENT 
     
      
       
      
    The proceedings 
     
      
       
      
    1 Sydney Olympic Park Authority [‘SOPA’] brought proceedings as a statutory corporation representing the Crown in right of New South Wales and in the name of the State of New South Wales [pursuant to s 4 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1988 (NSW)] against Civil & Civic Pty Ltd now known as Bovis Lend Lease Pty Ltd [presently referred to as ‘BLL’] and Lend Lease Corporation Ltd [‘LLC’]. The claims arose out of the construction by BLL of the pool facilities known as the Sydney Aquatic Centre at Homebush in anticipation of Sydney's staging of the 2000 Olympic Games. Those facilities suffered from significant defects. It was part of BLL's case that any claim, either in tort or in contract, arising out of those defects was statute-barred. 
     
      
       
      
    2 The applications presently before this Court are not concerned with the cross-claims. 
     
      
       
      
    The reference out 
     
      
       
      
    3 In May 2006 the whole of the proceedings were referred for enquiry and report pursuant to Part 20 rule 14 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 to the Hon Mr R L Hunter QC (‘the Referee’) whose report was dated 12 June 2007 (‘the Report’). Following that report orders were made dismissing the claim made against LLC, which claim had been pursued by reason of its role as guarantor of BLL’s contractual obligations.  
     
      
       
      
    4 The Referee dismissed the contractual claims as statute-barred under the Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) but upheld the claim in tort. 
     
      
       
      
    The applications presently before the Court 
     
      
       
      
    5 SOPA by notice of motion filed on 6 July 2007 seeks an order that the Report be adopted. Subject to some issues pursued qua revenue loss in the present applications SOPA stands to receive in the order of approximately $5 million plus interest in damages. 
     
      
       
      
    6 BLL objects to the adoption of the Report on the ground that the Referee erred in finding that: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         i. BLL owed a duty of care to Homebush Abattoir Corporation [""HAC""]; 
          
         ii. HAC's rights in tort were transferred to SOPA; 
          
         iii. SOPA's claim in tort was not statute-barred; 
          
         iv. SOPA proved that it suffered any consequential revenue loss. 
         
        
       
       
      
    The principles to be applied on the adoption application 
     
      
       
      
    7 There was no issue as to the principles to be applied. A short overview summary of those principles follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         i. Where, as here, the challenges to a referee’s report are directed to errors of law, the principles are well established. In  
         Homebush Abattoir Corporation v Bermria Pty Ltd  
         (1991) 22 NSWLR 605 the NSW Court of Appeal (Clarke, Meagher and Handley JJA) said (at 609) of proceedings regarding adoption of a referee’s report pursuant to Part 72 rule 13 of the  
         Supreme Court Rules 
          (which read identically to Part 20 rule 24 of the  
         Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 
         ): 
          
          
           
           “Whatever be the proper approach to a report dealing with issues of fact, there can be no justification for the Court exercising any restraint when dealing with a referee's decision on issues of law. The powers of reference currently conferred by Pt 72 are derived from powers of compulsory reference to an arbitrator or referee previously conferred on the court by s 15, s 16 and s 17 of the  
           Arbitration Act  
           1902. The nature and extent of the court's jurisdiction to supervise references under these sections was considered in  
           Buckley v Bennell Design and Construction Pty Ltd 
            (1978) 140 CLR 1. Jacobs J said (at 38): “… In respect of errors of law there can be no implied authority given to an arbitrator under s 16(1) to make errors of law.” 
            
            
           A referee appointed under Pt 72 can have no wider authority. In our opinion therefore the court in deciding what action to take on a referee's report is both entitled and bound to decide for itself whether the referee has erred in law and to correct any such error.” 
            
           
          
         ii. The following year, in  
         Super Pty Ltd v SJP Formwork (Aust) Pty Ltd  
         (1992) 29 NSWLR 549 Gleeson CJ (at 563) observed that the judge hearing such an application:  
          
          
           
           “has a judicial discretion to exercise in a manner that is consistent both with the object and purpose of the rules and with the wider setting in which they take their place. 
            
           That wider setting is a system for the administration of justice according to law. In so far as the subject matter of dissatisfaction with a referee's report is a question of law, or the application of legal standards to established facts, then a proper exercise of discretion would require a judge to consider and determine that matter afresh. That was decided by this Court in  
           Homebush Abattoir Corporation v Bermria Pty Ltd  
           (1991) 22 NSWLR 605: see also,  
           Cape v Maidment  
           (1991) 98 ACTR 1 at 4. That conclusion is entirely consistent with the history of the rules and the reasoning of the High Court in  
           Buckley  
           which, although the case related to different provisions is also instructive as to the present provisions.” 
            
           
          
         iii. As I put it in  
         Allied Constructions Pty Limited v Hyder Consulting (Australia) Pty Limited & Ors 
          [2004] NSWSC 808: 
          
          
           
           “There is no implied authority given to the Referee to make errors of law. The Court is bound to decide for itself whether the Referee erred in law and, if such error be found, to correct the error in exercising its discretion under the rules ( 
           Bermria 
            at 609).” 
            
           
          
         iv. The question whether, on a given set of facts, a duty of care was owed is a question of law: see the joint judgment of the High Court in  
         Amaca Pty Ltd v State of New South Wales 
          (2003) 199 ALR 596 (at 602 [26]): 
          
          
           
           “…there may be some question about whether the Court of Appeal, and therefore this Court, could undertake a review of the factual question of breach. But it is clear that the Court of Appeal did have power to determine whether, on the facts found at trial, the State did owe the injured plaintiff a duty of care 
           . 
            That was a question of law. If the Court of Appeal had identified the errors of law which the trial judge made, it would then have been appropriate, and in this case necessary, for the Court of Appeal to go on to consider whether the claim for contribution should have failed on the ground, urged by the State, that the State owed no duty of care to the injured plaintiff.” 
            
             
           
          
         v. A question of statutory interpretation is also a question of law, except to the extent that an expression in the statute is used in the sense that it has in ordinary speech, in which case the common understanding of that expression is to be determined as a question of fact: see  
         Hope v The Council of the City of Bathurst 
          (1980) 144 CLR 1 at 7 per Mason J: 
          
          
           
           “Many authorities can be found to sustain the proposition that the question whether facts fully found fall within the provisions of a statutory enactment properly construed is a question of law. One example is the judgment of Fullagar J in  
           Hayes v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 
            (1956) 96 CLR 47 at 51, where his Honour quoted the comment of Lord Parker of Waddington in  
           Farmer (Surveyor of Taxes) v Trustees 
             
           of Cotton 
            [1915] AC 922 at 932, which was adopted by Latham CJ in  
           Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Miller 
            (1946) 73 CLR 93 at 97 that where all the material facts are fully found, and the only question is whether the facts are such as to bring the case within the provisions properly construed of some statutory enactment, the question is one of law only. Fullagar J then said: “… this seems to me to be the only reasonable view. The distinction between the two classes of question is, I think greatly simplified, if we bear in mind the distinction, so clearly drawn by Wigmore, between the  
           factum probandum  
           (the ultimate fact in issue) and  
           facta probantia  
           (the facts adduced to prove or disprove that ultimate fact). The ‘facts’ referred to by Lord Parker … are the  
           facta probantia 
           . Where the  
           factum probandum  
           involves a term used in a statute, the question whether the accepted  
           facta probantia  
           establish that  
           factum probandum  
           will generally — so far as I can see, always — be a question of law.”  
            
            
           However, special considerations apply when we are confronted with a statute which on examination is found to use words according to their common understanding and the question is whether the facts as found fall within these words.  
           Brutus v Cozens 
            [1972] 2 All ER 1297 was just such a case. The only question raised was whether the appellant's behaviour was “insulting”. As it was not unreasonable to hold that his behaviour was insulting, the question was one of fact.  
            
            
           The judgment of Kitto J (sitting as a single judge) in  
           New South Wales Associated Blue-Metal Quarries Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 
            (1956) 94 CLR 509 is illuminating. Kitto J observed that the question whether certain operations answered the description “mining operations upon a mining property” within the meaning of s 122 of the  
           Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 
            as amended was a mixed question of law and fact (p 511). He went on to explain why this was so: “First it is necessary to decide as a matter of law whether the Act uses the expressions ‘mining operations’ and ‘mining property’ in any other sense than that which they have in ordinary speech.” Having answered this question in the negative, he noted that the “common understanding of the words has … to be determined” as “a question of fact”. He continued (at 512): “The next question must be whether the material before the court reasonably admits of different conclusions as to whether the appellant's operations fall within the ordinary meaning of the words as so determined; and that is a question of law: ibid; see also per Isaacs and Rich JJ in  
           Australian Slate Quarries Ltd v Federal Commissioner of  
           Taxation (1923) 33 CLR 416 at 419. If different conclusions are reasonably possible, it is necessary to decide which is the correct conclusion; and that is a question of fact: see per Williams J in the  
           Broken Hill South case 
            (1941) 65 CLR 150 at 160.” 
           
          
          
         vi. In  
         Azzopardi v Tasman UEB Industries Ltd 
          (1985) 4 NSWLR 139 at 156, Glass JA said:  
          
          
           
           “A finding of fact ... may nevertheless reveal an error of law where it appears that the trial judge has misdirected himself, i.e, has defined, otherwise than in accordance with law, the question of fact which he has to answer."" 
           
          
          
         vii. More generally, in  
         Chocolate Factory Apartments Pty Ltd v West Point Finance Pty Ltd 
          [2005] NSWSC 784 at [7], McDougall J, by reference to various authorities, including  
         Super Pty Ltd v SJP Formwork (Aust) Pty Ltd, Chloride Batteries Australia Ltd v Glendale Chemical Products Pty Ltd 
          (1988) 17 NSWLR 60,  
         White Constructions (NT) Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia 
          (1990) 7 BCL 193 and  
         Foxman Holdings Pty Ltd v NMBE Pty Ltd 
          (1994) 38 NSWLR 615 summarised the principles to be applied in considering whether to adopt or reject a referee’s report as follows: 
          
          
           
           “(1) An application under Pt 72 r 13 is not an appeal either by way of hearing de novo or by way of rehearing. 
            
            
           (2) The discretion to adopt, vary or reject the report is to be exercised in a manner consistent with both the object and purpose of the rules and the wider setting in which they take their place. Subject to this, and to what is said in the next two sub paragraphs, it is undesirable to attempt closely to confine the manner in which the discretion is to be exercised. 
            
            
           (3) The purpose of Pt 72 is to provide, where the interests of justice so require, a form of partial resolution of disputes alternative to orthodox litigation, that purpose would be frustrated if the reference were to be treated as some kind of warm up for the real contest. 
            
            
           (4) In so far as the subject matter of dissatisfaction with a report is a question of law, or the application of legal standards to established facts, a proper exercise of discretion requires the judge to consider and determine that matter afresh. 
            
            
           (5) Where a report shows a thorough, analytical and scientific approach to the assessment of the subject matter of the reference, the Court would have a disposition towards acceptance of the report, for to do otherwise would be to negate both the purpose and the facility of referring complex technical issues to independent experts for enquiry and report. 
            
            
           (6) If the referee’s report reveals some error of principle, absence or excessive jurisdiction, patent misapprehension of the evidence or perversity or manifest unreasonableness in fact finding, that would ordinarily be a reason for rejection. In this context, patent misapprehension of the evidence refers to a lack of understanding of the evidence as distinct from the according to particular aspects of it different weight; and perversity or manifest unreasonableness mean a conclusion that no reasonable tribunal of fact could have reached. The test denoted by these phrases is more stringent than “unsafe and unsatisfactory”. 
            
            
           (7) Generally, the referee’s findings of fact should not be re-agitated in the Court. The Court will not reconsider disputed questions of fact where there is factual material sufficient to entitle the referee to reach the conclusions he or she did, particularly where the disputed questions are in a technical area in which the referee enjoys an appropriate expertise. Thus, the Court will not ordinarily interfere with findings of fact by a referee where the referee has based his or her findings upon a choice between conflicting evidence. 
            
            
           (8) The purpose of Pt 72 would be frustrated if the Court were required to reconsider disputed questions of fact in circumstances where it is conceded that there was material on which the conclusions could be based. 
            
            
           (9) The Court is entitled to consider the futility and cost of re-litigating an issue determined by the referee where the parties have had ample opportunity to place before the referee such evidence and submissions as they desire. 
            
            
           (10) Even if it were shown that the Court might have reached a different conclusion in some respect from that of the referee, it would not be (in the absence of any of the matters referred to in sub para (6) above) a proper exercise of the discretion conferred by Pt 72 r 13 to allow matters agitated before the referee to be re-explored so as to lead to qualification or rejection of the report. 
            
            
           (11) Referees should give reasons for their opinion so as to enable the parties, the Court and the disinterested observer to know that the conclusion is not arbitrary, or influenced by improper considerations; but that it is the result of a process of logic and the application of a considered mind to the factual circumstances proved. The reasoning process must be sufficiently disclosed so that the Court can be satisfied that the conclusions are based upon such an intellectual exercise. 
            
            
           (12) The right to be heard does not involve the right to be heard twice. 
            
            
           (13) A question as to whether there was evidence on which the referee, without manifest unreasonableness, could have come to the decision to which he or she did come is not raised “by a mere suggestion of factual error such that, if it were made by a trial judge, an appeal judge would correct it”. The real question is far more limited: “to the situation where it is seriously and reasonably contended that the referee has reached a decision which no reasonable tribunal of fact could have reached; that is, a decision that any reasonable referee would have known was against the evidence and weight of evidence”. 
            
            
           (14) Where, although the referee’s reasons on their face appear adequate, the party challenging the report contends that they are not adequate because there was very significant evidence against the referee’s findings with which the referee did not at all deal, examination of the evidence may be undertaken to show that the reasons were in fact inadequate because they omitted any reference to significant evidence. 
            
            
           (15) Where the court decides that the reasons are flawed, either on their face or because they have been shown not to deal with important matters, the court has a choice. It may decline to adopt the report. Or it may itself look at the detail of the evidence to decide whether or not the expense of further proceedings before the referee (which would be the consequence of non adoption) is justified.” 
           
          
         
        
       
       
      
    Duty of care 
     
      
       
      
    8 During the respective addresses the Court was taken in considerable detail to a number of contractual relationships relating to the subject land as well as to a number of statutes recording the steps pursuant to which sundry statutory authorities came to succeed HAC. Whilst the reasons below from time to time require to return to certain particular detail of the contractual relationships and lines of statutory succession, the convenient course is to commence with a shorthand version of the central facts. At the outset however it should be noted that: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         i. the entity to which the Referee found that a duty of care was owed by BLL, was Homebush Abattoir Corporation (HAC) which was a statutory predecessor of SOPA; 
          
          
         ii. the duty derived essentially from various contractual relationships involving BLL, HAC and Lend Lease Development Pty Limited [“LLD”] and principally those relationships referred to in paragraph [66] of the Referee’s Report; 
          
          
         iii. the relationships between the various parties identified in that paragraph were taken by the Referee from recitals to the “Supplemental Deed to the HAC Agreement” of 19 December 1991 made between HAC and LLD. 
         
        
       
       
      
    The essential facts 
     
      
       
      
    9 The factual content in which the Supplemental Deed to the HAC Agreement came into existence was as follows:i. At all material times up to 1985, the land upon which the swimming pool complex was eventually constructed was owned by HAC, the statutory predecessor to SOPA.ii. In April 1985 an exclusive development agreement was entered into between LLD and HAC [“the HAC Agreement”] which provided LLD with exclusive development rights in respect of, inter alia, the land upon which the swimming pool complex was subsequently constructed. The HAC Agreement provided for the development of the ‘surplus land’ at Homebush Bay in order to provide a rental income stream to HAC.iii. The duration of the exclusive development agreement was a period of ten years from the date of agreement, within which time, although the land was still owned by HAC, LLD would have exclusive development rights to provide infrastructure, and to promote development of the land with the ultimate return to HAC being lease payments either on an annual or a one off lump sum basis.iv. In April 1988 the HAC land at Homebush was identified by the New South Wales Government as suitable for use in the proposed bid for the Olympic Games. Because LLD had exclusive development rights over the land, which rights had not expired in 1988, it was necessary, if the land was to be included in the Olympic bid, for there to be an agreement reached between HAC and LLD for the release of the development rights then enjoyed by LLD.v. It was as a result of discussions concerning this, that on 19 December 1991, the Supplemental Deed to the HAC Agreement was executed. However prior to the execution of this Deed the Homebush Abattoir Corporation (Dissolution and Transfer) Act 1991 had been passed [on 27 November 1991] to become effective on 1 January 1992, the effect of which Act would be to dissolve HAC and to constitute Homebush Bay Ministerial Corporation [‘HBMC’] as the first of HAC’s statutory corporation successors.

    vi. The December 1991 Supplemental Deed to the HAC Agreement provided that LLD would forgo its development rights over part of the land, the subject of the HAC Agreement, on condition that a building contract would be given to it for, inter alia, the construction of the swimming pool complex.vii. Also prior to the execution of the Supplemental Deed to the HAC agreement and on 13 November 1991, the then Premier of New South Wales sent a memorandum to all Ministers dealing with the reform of the capital works program in New South Wales.viii. The memorandum required that the Public Works Department was to be engaged by all Government Agencies (of which HAC was one) as the constructing authority for all capital works programs within New South Wales having a capital value of more than $500,000.00.ix. On 19 December 1991 a building contract encompassing the works involved in erecting the swimming pool complex was entered into between Minister for Public Works as principal, Civil & Civic Pty Limited [later BLL], LLD and Lend Lease Corporation Limited [LLC] (‘the 1991 building contract’) for the purpose of constructing various Olympic facilities including the swimming pool complex at Homebush Bay. The building contract was annexed to the Supplemental Deed to the HAC Agreement and executed contemporaneously with it. Recital F to the building contract provided that the works the subject of it were being carried out pursuant to the provisions of the Public Works Act 1912.x. It was contemplated by the Supplemental Deed to the HAC Agreement that LLD’s rights under it would be assigned to Civil & Civic Pty Limited [now BLL]. This, in fact, occurred (paragraphs 2.6 to 2.10 of the 1991 building contract) and upon that assignment being effected, Civil & Civic [BLL] became the builder of, inter alia, the swimming pool complex. 
     
      
       
      
    The approach taken by the Referee 
     
      
       
      
    10 It was against this background that the Referee, at [63] of his Report, defined the task upon which it was necessary for him to embark in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         “I think the correct approach to the determination of that question [whether BLL owed a duty to HAC and consequently SOPA] is through an examination of the surrounding circumstances of the Contract, of its form and of the contemporaneous and related Supplemental Deed to the HAC agreement.” 
         
        
       
       
      
    11 The Referee found (Report [64]) that “BLL owed ... a duty of care to HAC and that HAC’s correlative right devolved to SOPA through Homebush Bay Ministerial Corporation, HBDC [Homebush Bay Development Corporation] and the [Olympic Co-ordination] Authority under the vesting provision of the relevant legislation.”12 The Referee proceeded to examine those facts against various principles enunciated by cases in the High Court concerning matters to be taken into account in deciding whether a duty of care exists in any particular case.  
     
      
       
      
    Vulnerability 
     
      
       
      
    13 Following an examination of those cases, and in particular Woolcock Street Investments Pty Limited v CDG Pty Limited (2004) 216 CLR 515 (‘Woolcock’) and Perre and Ors v Apand Pty Limited (1999) 198 CLR 180 (‘Perre’), the Referee (at [87] of his Report), said that of the factors he had considered, what: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         “… emerges strongest as a guiding principle is the concept of vulnerability and its sibling reliance”. 
         
        
       
       
      
    14 As may be expected the parties on the instant applications spent considerable time examining the concept of vulnerability in terms of a determination as to whether or not a duty of care exists in any particular case and crucially, whether such a duty arose in the circumstances before the Referee. 
     
      
       
      
    15 The Referee summarised his findings at [91]-[94] of the Report in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         91. In my view, the circumstances of the HAC agreement, of the terms of the Supplemental deed together with the parties to and the terms of the 1991 agreement fixed LLD and BLL with the requisite responsibility for the subject risk; knowledge of the parties at risk; knowledge of HAC’s dependence upon the exercise of reasonable care by BLL in the performance of the Contract; with foreseeability of the damage to which HAC would be exposed by careless performance of that agreement, and established HAC’s vulnerability in the sense in which that expression was explained in  
         Woolcock 
         . 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         92.  
         If it had not been for the advent of the opportunity to hold the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000 the “Total Development Objective” of the HAC agreement would have been pursued in the form of a creation of a “commercial/industrial park estate with the intention of deriving (for HAC) an Ongoing Rental Income from the Estate …” Under such an arrangement I think it is also apparent from the terms of the HAC agreement that it would have had the capacity to protect itself in the contractual provisions governing the proposed development. 
         
        
        
         
         93. In my view no semblance of that capacity existed in the framework of the executive decisions taken in relation to the site. 
          
          
         94. No issue arises as to interference with the autonomy of the contracting parties to the Contract. 
         
        
       
      
    16 The Referee’s finding that a duty of care was owed by BLL to HAC derived principally from various contractual relationships involving those entities, which contractual relationships did not, however, include a direct contractual relationship between BLL and HAC. As BLL has contended, the imposition of a duty of care depended, ultimately, on findings (at Report [92] and [93]) that HAC was not able to protect itself contractually from the consequences of any fault on the part of BLL in the design and construction of the Aquatic Centre.  
     
      
       
      
    17 Earlier, (at Report [6]-[15]), the Referee had outlined the contractual matters relating to the Aquatic Centre’s construction and the legislative history relating to the ownership of the land on which the Centre was constructed, then considered the issue of whether SOPA or the State of New South Wales in an “extended sense” was the plaintiff and whether SOPA had standing to sue for breach of the construction contract (at Report [16]-[54]), before finding (at Report [60]-[61]) that SOPA had not acquired any contractual rights and did not have standing to sue BLL in contract. 
     
      
       
      
    18 Accordingly, the Referee commenced his consideration of the issue of whether a duty of care was owed by observing that, because SOPA had not acquired any contractual rights from the Minister for Public Works, there was no possibility of a concurrent duty in tort and contract (at Report [62]).  
     
      
       
      
    19 It is apparent from subsequent paragraphs, particularly Report [64] and [91]-[93], that the Referee considered that the only issue was whether BLL owed a duty to HAC, not whether BLL owed a duty directly to SOPA. Central to that issue was the question whether BLL owed a duty of care to HAC notwithstanding the absence of a contract between BLL and HAC. 
     
      
       
      
    20 However, the Referee initially identified (at Report [62]) the question to be considered, in the absence of any contractual rights in SOPA, as  
     
      
       
        
         
          
         “whether there is any tortious duty of care that BLL may have owed the owner of the site  
         at any time 
          in relation to or arising out of the performance of the Contract for the breach of which there lies an entitlement of SOPA to bring these proceedings in tort.” (Emphasis added.) 
         
        
       
       
      
    21 In addition to rejecting BLL’s submission that SOPA’s position as a subsequent owner of the land and the detailed construction contract were factors negating a duty of care to any emanation of the State, the Referee’s process of reasoning was to identify: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         i. the lack of a “conceptual determinant” in relation to a duty of care to avoid economic loss (at Report [77]); 
          
          
         ii. “vulnerability and its sibling reliance” as “what I think emerges strongest as a guiding principle” (at Report [87]); and  
          
          
         iii. the inability of HAC “to protect itself in the contractual provisions governing the proposed development” (at Report [92]). 
         
        
       
       
      
    22 As has already been made clear, the Referee identified (at Report [91]) the basis on which he found a duty of care as being “HAC’s vulnerability in the sense in which that expression was explained in Woolcock”.  
     
      
       
      
    23 He then went on at Report [92] and [93] to explain that “vulnerability” in more detail, in terms that: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         i. if it had not been for the Olympic Games, the HAC land would have been developed as a commercial/industrial park estate; 
          
          
         ii. if that had occurred, HAC “would have had the capacity to protect itself in the contractual provisions governing the proposed development”;  
          
          
         iii. “no semblance of that capacity existed in the framework of the executive decisions taken in relation to the site.” 
         
        
       
       
      
    24 The reference to “vulnerability in the sense ... explained in Woolcock” appears to be to the passage quoted at Report [79] from Woolcock at 530 [23]: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         “’Vulnerability’, in this context, is not to be understood as meaning only that the plaintiff was likely to suffer damage if reasonable care was not taken. Rather, ‘vulnerability’ is to be understood as a reference to the plaintiff’s inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant’s want of reasonable care, either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of loss on the defendant.”  
         
        
       
       
      
    25 It is thus apparent that the finding that BLL owed a duty of care to HAC, depended upon the circumstance, and thus a factual finding, that HAC was simply not in a position to acquire rights, either by contract or, presumably, by statute, against BLL in the event that BLL’s design or construction of the Aquatic Centre was defective.  
     
      
       
      
    Dealing with the issue 
     
      
       
      
    26 In my view for the reasons which follow, this conclusion was incorrect. Further, there was no other basis on which a duty of care to HAC could be found. 
     
      
       
      
    27 There was no evidence, apart from the documents themselves to which HAC was a party, which went to the issue of whether HAC could protect itself or which identified the so-called “framework of executive decisions” or which established that HAC relied on BLL in any way. No representative of HAC was called. The plaintiff appeared to assume that evidence from officers of the Department of Public Works constituted relevant evidence of reliance on BLL by any emanation of the State. There was a complete absence of direct evidence about HAC’s position at any point in time about any matter relevant to the question of whether HAC was “vulnerable”.  
     
      
       
      
    28 In the Report at [75], the Referee appears to have made a factual error, when he places reliance on BLL and HAC being in a “relationship...under the Supplemental deed”. [This error may have been due to the fact that the plaintiff pleaded that BLL was a party to the HAC Supplemental Deed: paragraph 36(d)(iv) of the Second Further Amended Summons.] BLL was not a party to the Supplemental deed and, although BLL was referred to in that document (i.e. as ‘Civil & Civic’), the Referee does not explain how those references give rise to a “relationship” or the nature of that relationship or how that relationship is relevant to the issue of whether BLL owed a duty of care to HAC. 
     
      
       
      
    29 As the Referee’s finding on the existence of a duty of care essentially derives from the contractual relationships between various entities, it is appropriate to immediately observe that a duty of care in tort is not imposed automatically even when there is a contractual relationship between parties, particularly when the duty asserted is in relation to pure economic loss. 
     
      
       
      
    The guidance which may be obtained from the authorities 
     
      
       
      
    30 In truth it is entirely appropriate to acknowledge the care and industry with which the Referee examined the authorities. Much of that analysis cannot be controverted. However in my respectful view the ultimate decision, which I accept treated with the most unusual set of circumstances, is incorrect. The reasons follow. 
     
      
       
      
    The ultimate question is one of fact 
     
      
       
      
    31 McHugh J in Perre at [129] made the important observation that the degree and nature of vulnerability sufficient to found a duty of care will no doubt vary from category to category and from case to case. The proposition included the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         i. “although each category will have to formulate a particular standard, the ultimate question will be  
         one of fact”; 
          
          
         ii. “the defendant's control of the plaintiff's right, interest or expectation would be an important test of vulnerability"". 
         
        
       
       
      
    32 Clearly the seminal recent cases in the High Court are Bryan v Maloney (1995) 182 CLR 609 and Woolcock. The Woolcock decision was of course handed down after the rejection of the doctrine of proximity as anything more than giving guidance or expressing the nature of what is in issue in determining whether a duty of care exists in Sullivan v Moody (2001) 207 CLR 562: cf the observations by McHugh J in Woolcock at [71]-[73]. That notwithstanding, considerable assistance may also be gleaned from the 1999 decision of the High Court in Perre and from observations made in the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Avenhouse & Anor v Council of the Shire of Hornsby (1998) 44 NSWLR 1: all of this against the pervasive influence still exerted by Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562. 
     
      
       
      
    Avenhouse v Council of the Shire of Hornsby  
     
      
       
      
    33 In Avenhouse, Priestley JA furnished a reasonably extensive examination of the decision in Donoghue v Stevenson, observing that it had become ""the foundational case for all modern consideration of the duty of care in Anglo-Antipodean law"" (at 5). His Honour expressed the view that no single formulation as to when a duty of care arose had gained general acceptance, other than what Lord Atkin had said in Donoghue v Stevenson, which Priestley JA believed (at 6) resolved into the question: ""is the contemplated relationship so close that the duty arises?"" 
     
      
       
       [This was a reference to Lord Atkin’s effective adoption, subject to a not insignificant explanatory qualification, of what had been put forward as the principle by A L Smith LJ 
        in  
       Le Lievre v Gould  
       [1893] 1 QB 491 at 504: 
        
         
          
         ""… that a duty to take due care did arise when the person or property of one was in such proximity to the person or property of another that, if due care was not taken, damage might be done by the one to the other."" 
          
         
        
       Lord Atkin's explanatory qualification (at 581) was: 
        
         
          
         ""I think that this sufficiently states the truth if proximity be not confined to mere physical proximity, but be used, as I think it was intended, to extend to  
         such close and direct relations that the act complained of directly affects a person whom the person alleged to be bound to take care  
         would know 
          would be directly affected by his careless act.  
         "" [Emphasis added by Priestley JA.]] 
          
         
        
       
      
    34 Priestley JA observed that as Lord Atkin in Donoghue v Stevenson had foreseen, cases continued to arise where it was difficult to determine how that question should be answered. The present is one of those cases.  
     
      
       
      
    35 Priestley JA [referring to Fleming, The Law of Torts, 9th ed (1998) at 151], ""no generalisation can solve the problem upon what basis the courts will hold that a duty of care exists"", accepted the statement as true. However in a passage in Avenhouse v Hornsby Shire Council (1998) 44 NSWLR 1 at 8 (cited with approval by Gummow J in Perre at [198]), Priestley JA observed that he did not think that what Professor Fleming was describing was “a problem to be solved”; rather that it was “a situation to be recognised”.

    Perre v Apand 
     
      
       
      
    36 McHugh J in Perre in treating at [100] with the reasons for denying or imposing a duty of care in cases of pure economic loss, observed that in determining whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         “the ultimate issue is always whether the defendant in pursuing a course of conduct that caused injury to the plaintiff, or failing to pursue a course of conduct which would have prevented injury to the plaintiff,  
         should have had 
          the interest or interests of the plaintiff in contemplation before he or she pursued or failed to pursue that course of conduct “: citing Lord Atkin in  
         Donoghue v Stevenson  
         [1932] AC 562 at 580. [Emphasis added.] 
         
        
       
       
      
    37 McHugh J in Perre dealt extensively with the concept of vulnerability at [104]-[105] and [118]-[129] observing: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         i. at [104] that what is likely to be decisive and is always of relevance in determining whether a duty of care is owed is the answer to the question, ""How vulnerable was the plaintiff to incurring loss by reason of the defendant's conduct?"". So also was the  
         actual 
          knowledge of the defendant concerning that risk and its magnitude [emphasis added]; 
          
          
         ii. at [105] in a passage noted at [85] by the Referee and taken by him from  
         Woolcock 
         , that the five principles concerned with reasonable foreseeability of loss, indeterminacy of liability, autonomy of the individual, vulnerability to risk and the defendant's knowledge of the risk and its magnitude, were relevant in determining whether a duty existed in all cases of liability for pure economic loss; 
          
          
         iii. at [118] that the vulnerability of a plaintiff to harm from the defendant's conduct is ordinarily a prerequisite to imposing a duty: 
          
          
           
           ""If the plaintiff has taken, or could have taken steps to protect itself from the defendant's conduct and  
           was not induced by the defendant's conduct from taking such steps 
           , there is no reason why the law should step in and impose a duty on the defendant to protect the plaintiff from the risk of pure economic loss"" [emphasis added];  
           
          
          
         iv. at [120] that in determining whether the plaintiff was vulnerable, an important consideration would be whether the plaintiff could easily have protected itself against the risk of loss by protective action, particularly by obtaining contractual warranties; 
          
          
         v. at [122] [in relation to the determination of whether a common law duty of care should be imposed on a defendant in terms of pure economic loss], that the agreement of the parties is ordinarily a better vehicle for determining their rights than imposing duties of care through the blunt application of negligence law; 
          
          
         vi. at [125], that reliance and assumption of responsibility are merely the indicators of the plaintiff's vulnerability to harm from the defendant's conduct, and that it was  
         the concept of vulnerability 
          rather than these evidentiary indicators, which was the relevant criterion for determining whether a duty of care existed [emphasis added]; 
          
          
         vii. drawing attention at [127] to the significance of the circumstance that the plaintiff was vulnerable to the defendant's conduct because the defendant 'controlled' the situation. 
         
        
       
       
      
    Bryan v Maloney 
     
      
       
      
    38 In Bryan v Maloney the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ, in examining the field of liability for mere economic loss being comparatively new in a developing area of the law of negligence, observed (at 618-619) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         “One policy consideration which may militate against recognition of a relationship of proximity in a category of case involving mere economic loss is the law's concern to avoid the imposition of liability “in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class”. Another consideration is the perception that, in a competitive world where one person's economic gain is commonly another's loss, a duty to take reasonable care to avoid causing mere economic loss to another, as distinct from physical injury to another's person or property, may be inconsistent with community standards in relation to what is ordinarily legitimate in the pursuit of personal advantage. The combined effect of those two distinct policy considerations is  
         that the categories of case in which the requisite relationship of proximity with respect to mere economic loss is to be found are properly to be seen as special 
         . 
           
         Commonly, but not necessarily, they will involve  
         an identified element of known reliance (or dependence) or the assumption of responsibility or a combination of the two. 
         ” 
          [Emphasis added.] 
          
         
        
       
       
      
    39 Later (at 627) in the joint judgment examination of the similarities between the relationships between builder and first owner and between builder and subsequent owner, their Honours drew attention to policy considerations. Here they observed that in the case of both relationships, the policy considerations which ordinarily militated against the recognition of a relationship of proximity and a consequent duty of care with respect to pure economic loss were insignificant. 
     
      
       
      
    Woolcock Street Investments v CDG40 In Woolcock at paragraphs [19], [21]-[24] (parts of which were repeated in the Referee's Report), Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ treated with the subject of economic loss as follows (footnotes omitted): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         [19] 
           
         The damage for which the appellant seeks a remedy in this case is the economic loss it alleges it has suffered as a result of buying a building which is defective. Circumstances can be imagined in which, had the defects not been discovered, some damage to person or property might have resulted from those defects. But that is not what has happened. The defects have been identified. Steps can be taken to prevent damage to person or property. 
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
           … 
           
          
         
         
          
         [21] 
           
         Claims for damages for pure economic loss present peculiar difficulty. Competition is the hallmark of most forms of commercial activity in Australia. As Brennan J said in  
         Bryan v Maloney: 
          
          
           
           If liability were to be imposed  
           for the doing of anything which caused pure economic loss 
            that was foreseeable, the tort of negligence would destroy commercial competition, sterilise many contracts and, in the well-known dictum of Chief Judge Cardozo, expose defendants to potential liability “in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class 
           ”. 
            
            
           That is why damages for pure economic loss are not recoverable if all that is shown is that the defendant’s negligence was a cause of the loss and the loss was reasonably foreseeable. 
            
           
          
         [22] 
           
         In  
         Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Dredge “Willemstad” 
         , the court held that there were circumstances in which damages for economic loss were recoverable. In  
         Caltex Oil 
         , cases for recovery of economic loss were seen as being exceptions to a general rule, said to have been established in  
         Cattle v Stockton Waterworks Co 
         , that even if the loss was foreseeable, damages are not recoverable for economic loss which was not consequential upon injury to person or property. In  
         Caltex Oil 
         , Stephen J isolated a number of “salient features” which combined to constitute a sufficiently close relationship to give rise to a duty of care owed to Caltex for breach of which it might recover its purely economic loss. Chief among those features was the defendant’s knowledge that to damage the pipeline which was damaged was inherently likely to produce economic loss. 
          
          
         [23] 
           
         Since  
         Caltex Oil 
         , and most notably in  
         Perre v Apand Pty Ltd 
         , the vulnerability of the plaintiff has emerged as an important requirement in cases where a duty of care to avoid economic loss has been held to have been owed.  
         “Vulnerability”, in this context, is not to be understood as meaning only that the plaintiff was likely to suffer damage if reasonable care was not taken. Rather, “vulnerability” is to be understood as a reference to the plaintiff’s inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendant’s want of reasonable care, either entirely or 
           
         at least in a way which would cast the consequences of loss on the defendant 
         . 
          So, in  
         Perre 
         , the plaintiffs could do nothing to protect themselves from the economic consequences to them of the defendant’s negligence in sowing a crop which caused the quarantining of the plaintiffs’ land. In  
         Hill (t/as R F Hill & Associats) v Van Erp 
         , the intended beneficiary depended entirely upon the solicitor performing the client’s retainer properly and the beneficiary could do nothing to ensure that this was done. But in  
         Esanda Finance Corp Ltd v Peat Marwick Hungerfords 
         ,  
         (Reg) 
          the financier could itself have made inquiries about the financial position of the company to which it was to lend money, rather than depend upon the auditor’s certification of the accounts of the company. 
          
          
         [24] 
           
          In other cases of pure economic loss ( 
         Bryan v Maloney 
          is an example) reference has been made to notions of assumption of responsibility and known reliance. The negligent misstatement cases like  
         Mutual Life & Citizens’ Assurance Co Ltd v Evatt 
          and  
         L Shaddock & Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council (No 1) 
          can be seen as cases in which a central plank in the plaintiff’s allegation that the defendant owed it a duty of care is the contention that the defendant knew that the plaintiff would rely on the accuracy of the information the defendant provided. And it may be, as Professor Stapleton has suggested, that these cases, too, can be explained by reference to notions of vulnerability. … 
          
          [Emphasis added.] 
         
        
       
       
      
    Returning to the case in hand 
     
      
       
      
    41 In essence the Referee’s process of reasoning was that a duty of care was owed by BLL to HAC because of the series of agreements between, variously, HAC, the Minister for Public Works, BLL, LLC and LLD.42 This finding that a duty of care was owed was incorrect. There was no relevant ‘vulnerability’ [or other relevant circumstance] which justified the imposition on BLL of a duty of care to HAC, in addition to BLL’s contractual obligations to the Minister for Public Works, in circumstances, in particular, in which HAC was in a position to adequately protect its own interests as owner of the land, either by contract or statute, or in which BLL was entitled to reasonably assume that State authorities could be relied upon to provide that protection to this statutory corporation destined for dissolution, as well as to its successors. 
     
      
       
      
    43 Certainly the facts present as unusual in the extreme. It must however be recalled that: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         i. cases for recovery of mere economic loss where a common law duty of care is imposed are exceptional; 
          
          
         ii. significance is placed in the authorities on the proposition that the Court must be on guard against a finding of a duty of care which would impose indeterminate liability and for the correlative need ""to avoid imposing unreasonable burdens on the freedom of individuals to protect or pursue their own legitimate social and business interests without the need  
         to be concerned 
          with other persons’ interests”: cf  
         Perre 
          at [101] and footnote 150, per McHugh J. [Emphasis added.] 
         
        
       
       
      
    44 In the same vein Gleeson CJ observed in Perre (at [5]) that the considerations which would remain influential in restraining acceptance of a duty of care not to cause reasonably foreseeable financial harm included the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         ""First, bearing in mind the expansive application which has been given to the concept of reasonable foreseeability in relation to physical injury to personal property, a duty to avoid any reasonably foreseeable financial harm needs to be constrained by  
         ‘some intelligent limits 
          to keep the law of negligence within the bounds of common sense and practicality’"". 
          
          
         Secondly, to permit recovery of foreseeable economic loss, which may or may not occur in a commercial setting, for any negligent conduct, may interfere with freedoms, controls and limitations established both by common law and statute in many legal contexts.  
          
          
         Thirdly, in those cases where the loss occurs in a commercial setting, a third party, C, may suffer financial harm as a result of conduct which is regulated by a contract between A and B. It may be that the consequences of such conduct as between A and B are governed and limited by the contract. …"" [Emphasis added.] 
         
        
       
       
      
    45 The circumstances in which the Referee determined that BLL owed a duty of care were commercial and were permeated by the complex web of legislative steps earlier identified in these reasons. HAC was not sidelined from a contractual involvement by anything which BLL did: to the contrary the proper inference from what occurred is that BLL was entitled to proceed on the reasonable assumption that HAC’s interests would be protected in every necessary parameter by the arrangements being made to constitute its statutory corporation successors with appropriate saving arrangements. BLL of course, had no responsibility for the framework of executive decisions which would come to be made. 
     
      
       
      
    46 Further during the time that HAC existed (i.e. prior to 1 January 1992) such contractual arrangements as did include BLL [then Civil & Civic] did not, at that point in time, identify in terms of the design and construction of the Aquatic Centre, what was to be built. The 1991 agreement, read with the September 1991 Facility Brief, went no further than to identify that it would be a swimming facility including a leisure pool: see September 1991 Facility Brief Exh AH tab 2 section A7.1 at p18. However, what was to be built to achieve that broad description was to be identified at some time in the future in a “Brief” to be provided by the Minister for Public Works (see section 3 of the 1991 agreement and in particular cl 3.1: Exh AH tab 3). In other words, although at a later stage there were detailed plans and specifications, before HAC ceased to exist there was insufficient precision in the identification of what BLL’s [Civil & Civic’s] obligations were, to readily identify the scope of any duty of care. This seems to me also to be yet another indicator of the need for special caution, before imposing upon BLL a duty of care to a non-contracting statutory corporation destined for dissolution and whose interests BLL was reasonably entitled to assume, were being protected by those responsible for determining its statutory corporation's lines of succession. 
     
      
       
      
    47 Ultimately, notions of HAC’s vulnerability [of the type of which the Referee found gave rise to the duty of care] are misconceived. They offend the necessity to observe 'intelligent limits' to keep the law of negligence within the bounds of common sense and practicality. In the particular context the imposition of the duty of care would impose unreasonable burdens on the freedom, here of BLL, to protect or pursue its own legitimate commercial interests without the need to be concerned with the interests of HAC. BLL was entitled to assume that those interests were being adequately catered for by the detailed web of contractual/statutory arrangements made on behalf of the State of New South Wales authorities in respect of the devolution of rights and interests in one of its authorities, HAC, destined for dissolution. It was entitled to infer that those interests were being protected by the contractual provisions put into place by arms length negotiations and by such other arrangements, if any, as had been (or were to be) put into place by the State authorities to indemnify the owners of the land from any loss they may suffer by reason of the pool facility or other constructions. 
     
      
       
      
    48 One only of the measures of protection of HAC’s statutory successor, HBDC, is to be found in the Growth Centres (Development Corporations) Act 1974, where a ‘development corporation’ constituted under Part 2 is charged under Part 3 with the responsibility of promoting, coordinating, managing and securing the orderly and economic development of the growth centre. HBDC was constituted as a development corporation under this Act by the Growth Centres (Homebush Bay Development Corporation) Order 1992. Hence HBDC was granted the responsibilities and power to be involved in the development on its land. 
     
      
       
      
    49 Under s 7(2) of the Act the development corporation has and may exercise and discharge particular powers, authorities, duties and functions and these include the requirement to submit to the Minister, such proposals with respect to the development and use of the land as it considers necessary or appropriate (s7(2)(a)) and to carry out research into problems with respect to the development and use of the planning and development of land within the growth centre (s7(2)(c)). In short the statutory scheme and the Order made pursuant to the Growth Centres (Development Corporations) Act 1974 constituting HBDC had the result that HBDC had statutory responsibility to be involved in the development of the Aquatic Centre [on land the title to which had devolved upon it] and under section 18 HBDC had power to make and enter into contracts with any person for, among other purposes, the carrying out of works or the performance of services.  
     
      
       
      
    50 By 1992 before any work had been carried out on the site there were detailed statutory provisions which obligated the successor to HAC to be involved in issues concerning it. What effectively occurred appears to have been that HBDC simply permitted the Minister for Public Works to take over. The detailed provisions which obligated and/or empowered HBDC to be involved are section 7 [‘responsibility, etc, of development corporation’] and section 18 which provided express power to enter into contracts, section 19 which expressly empowered it to enter into arrangements with other public authorities, including the Minister for Public Works, and even more importantly, section 21 which empowered it to make use of the services of any officers, employees or facilities of any Government Department. Section 22 required that in the exercise and discharge of its responsibilities, powers, etc, it (as far as practicable) consult and negotiate with public authorities and Government Departments whose responsibilities, powers, etc included those of the same or of a similar nature.51 To adopt the words used in the majority judgment in Bryan v Maloney, the particular circumstances were devoid of either: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         (i) an identified element of known reliance (or dependence) or 
          
          
         (ii) the assumption of responsibility. 
         
        
       
       
      
    52 Hence BLL was entitled to proceed on the basis that its liability was regulated, governed and limited by the building contract: cf Gleeson CJ in Perre at [5]. 
     
      
       
      
    SOPA's challenge to the Referee's findings concerning the capacity in which it sued 
     
      
       
      
    53 SOPA challenges the Referee's findings in relation to the 'capacity to sue' issue and seeks to reargue the proposition put to and rejected by the Referee that SOPA can by force of the provisions of the Crown Proceedings Act 1988 (NSW), sue on behalf of the Crown which made the contract. 
     
      
       
      
    54 In the alternative, SOPA again by way of challenge to the Referee's findings, addresses submissions in support of the proposition that the Minister for Public Works, when he entered into the contract with BLL, did so as the agent of HAC, with the consequence that the contractual rights enjoyed by HAC vested in SOPA. The agency for the making of the contract is said to be between the Minister as agent and SOPA as principal. 
     
      
       
      
    55 These are contentions which can be shortly disposed of for the reason that I have been unable to discern any shortcoming or flaw in the careful and detailed approach taken by the Referee on both these issues. 
     
      
       
      
    The Crown Proceedings Act 
     
      
       
      
    56 The Referee carefully examined [Report [16] et seq] the various parameters concerning the capacity in which SOPA sued. That examination included a careful treatment of the way in which the case had been pleaded. 
     
      
       
      
    57 The Crown Proceedings Act submissions were dealt with by the Referee at [31]-[42]. 
     
      
       
      
    58 The totality of the written submissions of SOPA in relation to this matter read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         i. Section 6 of the  
         Sydney Olympic Park Authority Act 2001 
          provides: 
          
          
           
           “The Authority is, for the purposes of any Act, a statutory body representing the Crown.” 
           
          
          
         ii. Sections 3 and 4 of the  
         Crown Proceedings Act 1988 
          defines “Crown” as: 
          
           
            
           s 3. Crown means the Crown in right of New South Wales, and includes: 
            
            
             
             (a) the Government of New South Wales; and 
              
              
             (b) a Minister of the Crown in right of New South Wales; and 
              
              
             (c) a statutory corporation, or other body, representing the Crown in right of New South Wales. 
             
            
            
           S 4. Crown may sue 
            
            
             
             The Crown may bring civil proceedings under the title `State of New South Wales’ against any person in any competent court. 
             
            
           
          
          
         iii. The plaintiff in this case is the State of New South Wales, as the Further Amended Summons title page indicates. 
          
          
         iv. Clearly, by reason of legislative authority, SOPA is able to bring proceedings on behalf of the State of New South Wales. In other words, it can by force of the statute, sue on behalf of the Crown which made the contract. 
         
        
       
       
      
    59 The submissions are rejected as misconceived. 
     
      
       
      
    60 The reasons given by the Referee which are free from error were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         [31] I have some difficulty in accepting that if these proceedings are brought by the State as the Principal seeking to enforce its rights under the Contract and concurrent duties of care in tort that SOPA has any standing to bring those proceedings, notwithstanding its creation as a statutory corporation representing the Crown and so falling within the definition of the Crown in s.3 of the  
         Crown Proceedings Act 
          and its entitlement to sue in the name of the State of New South Wales pursuant to s.4 of that Act. 
          
          
         [32] I think something more than SOPA being so constituted to represent the Crown and to sue in the name of the State of New South Wales is necessary, otherwise it would follow that any statutory corporation so constituted (and there are several) would have been entitled to bring these proceedings while having no connection with the Contract or its subject matter. 
          
          
         [33] In considering the capacity of SOPA to bring these proceedings in the name of the State of New South Wales one may start with some basic propositions. Simply because SOPA is a statutory corporation representing the Crown under its incorporating legislation it carries no entitlement to enforce Crown rights regardless of their subject matter. By way of illustration SOPA would not be entitled to enforce Public Works rights under the Contract simply because SOPA was incorporated as an entity representing the Crown anymore than Public Works could enforce SOPA’s rights as owner of the subject site. To the extent that it has been contended on behalf of the State that SOPA is entitled so to act, that part of the plaintiff’s case is ill-founded in my view. 
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
         [34] This much is clear I think from the limited nature of the capacity of SOPA as a corporation representing the Crown as explained in the joint judgment of McHugh and Gummow JJ in  
         State Authorities Superannuation Board v Commissioner of State Taxation for the State of Western Australia 
          (1996) 189 CLR 253 at 280 et seq. In that case the plaintiff Board was a statutory corporation constituted by the  
         Superannuation Administration Act 1987 
         , s.4 of which constituted the authority as one “for the purposes of any Act, a statutory body representing the Crown”. 
          
          
         [35] The effect of that section in the context of the  
         Crown Proceedings Act 1988  
         was considered in the joint judgment of their Honours in the following way: 
          
          
           
           “Section 4 of the 1987 Act had, as its primary operation, the constitution of the (Board) as a corporation and it also, to the limited extent we will describe, classified it as ‘representative’ of the Crown, albeit not the Crown itself.  
            
            
           …it will be apparent that the effect of s 4(2) was not to render the (Board) the representative of the Crown for all purposes, still less to deem it to be the Crown (referring to  
           Wynyard Investments Pty Limited v Commissioner for Railways (NSW)  
           (1955) 93 CLR 376 at 386). 
            
            
           …Kitto J explained in Wynyard Investments…that the phrase ‘representing the Crown’ does not of itself necessarily convey any clear meaning. The question is not really one of attribution of the status of Crown representative; rather, it concerns the relationship of the entity in question to the Crown in respect of the particular matter in which the impact of the relevant provisions is incurred. 
           
          
          
           
           The phrase ‘representing the Crown’ does appear in the  
           Crown Proceedings Act 1988 (NSW) 
            in a fashion which indicates a particular operation of the classification of the (Board) as a statutory body representing the Crown” (at 280). 
           
          
          
         [36] Most of the cases turning to this question are concerned either with the construction of s.75(iv) of the Constitution for in examining the “shield of the Crown” doctrine and are instructive in the approach that should be adopted in relation to proceedings by a corporation such as SOPA. One such case is that of  
         Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v State Bank 
           
         of New South Wales 
          (1992) 174 CLR 219 where at 230 the Court, in considering that doctrine, observed: 
          
          
           
           “The ‘shield of the Crown’ doctrine has evolved as a means of ascertaining whether an agency or instrumentality ‘represents’ the Crown for the purpose of determining whether that agency or instrumentality is bound by a statute enacted by the legislature. The doctrine is in essence an aid to the process of statutory interpretation whereby the courts seek to ascertain the legislative intent of Parliament. Hence it has been said that an agency or instrumentality may be endowed with the attributes of the Crown for one purpose but not for others. Indeed, the legislature could explicitly endow a private corporation carrying on business for private purposes with the privileges and immunities of the Crown, yet that private corporation would not answer the description of ‘a State’ for constitutional purposes”. 
           
          
          
         [37] In an ex-tempore judgment in  
         State of New South Wales v Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
          [2001] NSWSC 1067, Young CJ in Eq considered the capacity of the State to sue for rights in the nature of subrogation vested in a statutory corporation (which by its constituting statute was established as one representing the Crown), notwithstanding the demise of that corporation upon the repeal of its incorporating statute. 
          
          
         [38] The State’s case was that the rights of subrogation had vested at the time of that repealing stature and remained vested in the Crown so entitling the State to bring the subject proceedings. That involved the proposition that, if the statutory corporation was the Crown, any such vested rights in the Crown would remain unaffected by the demise of the corporation and enforceable at the suit of the State. 
          
          
         [39] Young J treated the question as being “concerned with whether the (corporation) was an agent of the Crown (in the discharge of its statutory functions) and whether rights (so) acquired by it were exercisable by the Crown directly” (para 21). 
          
          
         [40] That question was answered in the negative and in so doing his Honour adopted as a correct statement of the law the passage in “Seddon Government Contracts”, 2 
         nd  
         ed, as follows: 
          
          
           
           “A phrase commonly used when discussing the question of Crown immunities is ‘Crown agent’. It is said that when a personal body is carrying out a Crown function it is acting as the Crown’s agent, or as a Crown agent, and that therefore it should benefit from any relevant Crown immunity. The use of this language can be misleading and confusion may arise from different meanings of the word ‘agent’ in private and public law. It is possible…for a body which is contracting on its own behalf, for example the statutory corporation, to enjoy a Crown immunity. Agency, in its private law sense, which presupposes that the government is the principal, simply does not arise. The relevant inquiry is not whether the body is acting as an agent so much as whether the body should enjoy Crown immunity.” 
           
          
          
         [41] His Honour added the following further observation: 
          
          
           
           “One must be careful whenever one is dealing with the concept of agency. As the High Court made clear in  
           Petersen v Maloney 
            (1951) 84 CLR 91, the tag ‘agent’ is apt to mislead. One must always ask ‘Agent for what purpose and with what authority’? The term Crown agent does not usually denote someone with authority from the Crown to do something, but merely that that person has Crown immunity and Crown indemnity. This is consistent with the judgment of Menhennit J…, with the judgment of Dixon J in  
           Bank of New South Wales v The Commonwealth 
            (1948) 76 CLR 1, and what was said by the South Australian Full Court in 
            Commercial Oil Refiners Pty Limited v South Australia  
           (1974) 9 SASR 88, 93” (para 83). 
           
          
          
         [42] So I think it is reasonably clear that if SOPA has any standing to bring these proceedings in contract, in particular, something more needs to be shown than that it is a corporation constituted as one representing the Crown and that Public Works entered into the Contract on behalf of the State. SOPA has submitted that in this case it has sufficient “connection” with the subject matter of the claimed rights sufficient to entitle it to bring these proceedings, or alternatively that it has succeeded to rights accrued through its statutory predecessors originating in Public Works entering into the Contract as agent for one or other of those predecessors. 
         
        
       
       
      
    Agency 
     
      
       
      
    61 Here again the reasons given by the Referee to be found in the report at [43] – [61] are not infected by error. They are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         [43] The starting point in considering SOPA’s capacity to sue for the relief sought in these proceedings is the Contract and, in particular, the description of the Principal as the contracting party namely The Minister for Public Works for The State of New South Wales for and on behalf of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second in the State of New South Wales: a description which standing alone leaves little or no room for debate on the proposition that the Minister acted as the Crown as principal under those agreements. In the Commonwealth Bank case Young J accepted as accurate the following statement of the nature of the Crown as the Sovereign and in an extended sense as follows: 
          
          
           
           “The Crown in the narrowest sense is the Sovereign and in regard to New South Wales is usually referred to as the ‘Crown in Right of New South Wales’; … The term ‘Crown’ is sometimes used in an extended sense to refer to the body politic which includes the members, servants and agents of the executive government: see  
           Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Limited 
            (1999) 198 CLR 334 at 347. This sense has never been fully developed in English or Australian law. …the  
           Crown Proceedings Act 1988 
            adopts, in part, this extended notion” (para 20). 
            
           
          
         [44] The Contract then was made by the Crown in right of New South Wales through the Minister for Public Works. That fact alone I think removes the foundation for the submissions on behalf of the plaintiff that the Minister entered into the Contract as agent for HAC or HBDC. 
          
          
         [45] It is difficult to find anything in the surrounding circumstances or in the contents of the Contract to support the concept of agency between the Minister and either of those entities. Apart from the description of the contracting authority, the terms of the recitals identify the purpose of the Contract as the proposal of “the New South Wales Government…to construct sporting and related facilities at” the site to “support the Bid by the City of Sydney to conduct the Olympic Games in the year 2000”. It was further recited that the Minister had been authorised under the provisions of the  
         Public Works Act 1912 
          by the Governor to carry out the subject work. 
          
          
         [46] The plaintiff has placed reliance upon the contents of a memorandum of the then Premier of New South Wales of 13 November 1991 directed to all Ministers notifying them of the introduction of a revised procedure for capital works implementation. It required use of public works for the “private sector interface role” in conformity with an attached paper which called for the appointment of public works “to undertake in conjunction with client agencies the private sector interface role for all Budget sector and nominated non-Budget sector Agencies…for capital works over $500,000…on a fee-for-service basis” and designated Public Works in that interface role as acting “as an arm of its client, directly advising CEO’s and their Ministers on capital works procurement issues”. 
          
          
         [47] There does not appear to be any issue that this directive governed Public Works entry into the Contract. However, I observe that it is not entirely clear to me that that is the case. In any event, the contents of the Contract do not, in my view, support the concept of agency for the benefit of HAC or its successor in title as disclosed or undisclosed principals.  
          
          
         [48] That position I think is consistent with the fact that the site was the subject of the HAC agreement whereby LLD had been granted exclusive development rights in respect of an area of which the site formed part and that the Government’s plans in 1991 calling for the modification of those rights was effected contemporaneously with the signing of the 1991 agreement by the execution of the Supplemental deed. 
          
          
         [49] The recitals of that deed are I think instructive in that they recite the history of the HAC agreement and the involvement of government in relation to the development of the site. In particular it was recited as follows: 
          
          
           
           “As a result of numerous studies initiated by the New South Wales Government Homebush Bay was identified in April 1988 as the most suitable site in Sydney to house the majority of the Olympic related sports facilities. Sydney’s proposed bid for the year 1996 Olympic Games tendered Homebush Bay as the venue for a significant number of sporting facilities.  
            
            
           …The parties understand that on 28 February 1991, Sydney’s bid for the year 2000 Olympic Games was initiated. The bid was supported by the New South Wales Government, the Opposition, Sydney City Council and the Australian Government.  
           
          
          
           
           The parties understand that in association with and in support of the bid for the year 2000 Olympic Games, the Governor authorised the construction of certain sports facilities within Homebush Bay. 
            
            
           The parties understand that the New South Wales Government has concluded that…a portion of the land the subject of the HAC Agreement (Excluded Land) would be required in order to allow the full extent of the facilities necessary to support the year 2000 Olympic Games bid to be constructed at Homebush Bay. 
            
            
           In recognition of the need to construct certain facilities at Homebush Bay the New South Wales Government has decided that the Excluded Land is land that is appropriate for the construction of a proportion of the required sporting facilities… 
            
            
           The New South Wales Government has determined the Excluded Land be developed by the construction of sporting facilities…and that (LLD) be requested to provide the services with respect to the design and construction of these works… 
            
            
           As a result of the New South Wales Government requiring the Excluded Land for the year 2000 Olympic Games bid, (LLD) has agreed to enter into (the supplemental) Deed and has agreed to the removal of the Excluded Land from the scope of the HAC Agreement… 
            
            
           Upon (LLD) entering into this Deed the Minister for Public Works will enter into the procurement contract…with (LLD) with respect to the works.” 
            
           
          
         [50] Incidental to those arrangements, HAC had agreed to consent to an assignment by LLD of its rights under the ‘procurement contract’ to BLL. It was acknowledged that the Supplemental deed would be executed contemporaneously with the 1991 agreement. 
          
          
         [51] I am satisfied that Public Works did not enter into the Contract as agent of any of SOPA’s predecessors’ in title to the site and that no contractual rights devolved to SOPA under its  
         Incorporating Act 
          or the  
         2002 Dissolution Act 
         . I think it follows from that conclusion that the only capacity of SOPA to bring these proceeding in enforcement of any contractual rights under the Contract may only be founded on its status under its  
         Incorporating Act 
          as a corporation representing the Crown while recognising the contractual rights are those directly conferred on the Crown by that Contract through the Minister acting on behalf of the Crown. 
          
          
         [52] For SOPA to establish that entitlement I think it is necessary to recognise that its limited capacity as a corporation representing the Crown requires it to establish that its relationship “to the Crown in respect of the particular matter” which is the subject of these proceedings is such as to entitle it to bring the proceedings in the name of the State of New South Wales. 
          
          
         [53] In my view SOPA does not achieve that by demonstrating that either it or its predecessors in title have exercised their statutory rights in relation to the ownership of the subject site in, for example, entering into a lease with the relevant Minister in respect of land of which the site formed part and in relation to the license granted to Sydney Cricket and Sports Ground Trust to operate facilities on the site, the subject of the Aquatic and Athletic Centres Deed of 30 May 2000 (Exhibit AH, Tab 89). 
          
          
         [54] Examination of the  
         Sydney Olympic Park Authority Act 2001  
         provides little basis for a “connection” sufficient to validate SOPA’s institution of these proceedings on behalf of the Crown, notwithstanding s.6 constituting it as a corporation representing the Crown. The objects of the Act are stated to include the making of reasonable attempts to ensure that Sydney Olympic Park becomes a successful town and sporting centre (s.3). 
          
          
         [55] The land comprising Sydney Olympic Park was vested in SOPA for an estate in fee simple (s.7) subject to any trusts, interests or charges (s.10). Its functions were generally defined in s.13 as including the promotion of the use of the park and the management of its infrastructure; promotion of cultural and sporting activities and liaising with Olympic organisations. 
          
          
         [56] It was also authorised to perform “all such supplemental incidental or consequential acts as may be necessary or expedient for the exercise of its functions” (s.14). Succeeding sections regulate various aspects of the performance of its functions none of which in my view are of assistance in providing a connection with the Contract.  
          
          
         [57] Schedule 8, clause 3 purported to vest certain assets of Olympic Coordination Authority in SOPA however that clause was expressed in terms that required the determination of the Director-General of the Authority for the identification of assets to be vested. There was no evidence of any such determination having been made and presumably as a consequence the  
         Olympic Co-Ordination Authority Dissolution Act 2002 
          was enacted. The vesting provisions of that Act included the transfer to SOPA of the assets, rights and liabilities of the Authority (subject to some exclusions) vesting without the need for any conveyance or assignment. Those rights and liabilities of the Authority were deemed to become those of SOPA and all proceedings commenced by or against the Authority at the time of the transfer were taken to be proceedings by or against SOPA (ss.6 and 7). 
          
          
         [58] Where reference was made to assets rights and liabilities that reference carried the following meanings 
          
           
            
           •  
           In relation to  
           assets 
            it meant “any legal or equitable estate or interest (whether present or future and whether vested or contingent) in real or personal property of any description (including money), and includes securities, choses in action and documents. 
            
            
           •  
           Liabilities 
            meant “any liabilities, debts or obligations (whether present or future and whether vested or contingent). 
            
            
           •  
           Rights 
            meant “any rights, powers, privileges or immunities (whether present or future and whether vested or contingent). 
           
          
          
         [59] I have referred to those definition provisions as I think they have some bearing on the assessment of SOPA’s entitlement to bring proceedings in tort. 
          
          
         [60] In summary then, I think SOPA gains no sufficient support for its claim of entitlement to bring these proceedings in the name of the State so far as they purport to enforce contractual obligations of BLL under the Contract and outside of those provisions I find insufficient connection through SOPA’s ownership of the site and its operation, nor from any assets or rights which may have devolved upon SOPA under its constituting and enabling Acts: this on the premise as I have found that there was no agency relationship between Public Works and any of SOPA’s predecessors in title and that the Contract was entered into by the Minister on behalf of the Crown in right of the State of New South Wales. 
          
          
         [61] On that approach the Crown in its “unextended” sense is the entity that could enforce those contractual rights and could do so through Public Works and not through SOPA or any of its predecessors in title. 
         
        
       
       
      
    62 As BLL has contended it seems clear that the Minister for Public Works could not have contracted as agent for SOPA.  
     
      
       
      
    63 SOPA did not exist at the time the contract was either made or performed. SOPA is a separate entity to HAC, not a continuation of HAC under a new name.  
     
      
       
      
    64 An agent may contract on behalf of an undisclosed principal but not on behalf of a non-existent principal.  
     
      
       
      
    65 The extract from the 16th edition of Bowstead & Reynolds on agency (1996) to which the plaintiff refers in its submissions regarding retrospective constitution of an agency relationship by subsequent ratification by the principal of acts done on his behalf, does not apply to the situation where, as here, the principal did not exist at the time of commission of the acts purportedly done on its behalf.  
     
      
       
      
    66 As the current edition of Bowstead & Reynolds on agency (17th ed, 2001) states (at 2-060): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         “The only person who has power to ratify an act is the person in whose name or on whose behalf the act purported to be done, and it is necessary that he should have been in existence at the time when it was done [ 
         Kelner v Baxter 
          (1866) LR2CP 174] and competent at that time and at the time of ratification to be the principal of the person doing the act ...” 
          
          
         See also to similar effect Dal Pont  
         Law of Agency 
          Butterworths 2001 paragraph 5.13 citing  
         Trident General Insurance Co Pty Ltd v McNiece Bros Pty Ltd 
          (1987) 8 NSWLR 270: 
          
          
           
           “A principal who lacked the capacity to enter a contract at the time when it was made cannot ratify the contract”.  
           
          
         
        
       
       
      
    67 The difficulty with the plaintiff’s reliance on principles of agency in relation to private transactions is that they are not apt to be applied to contracts involving various arms of Government. That is because, unlike in the case of private entities, it would not necessarily be assumed that a Minister, when entering into a contract, would be acting as agent for a statutory corporation such as either HAC or SOPA.  
     
      
       
      
    68 The reasonableness of the proposition put forward by the plaintiff depends upon the notion that a private corporation which owned land would have a very real interest in a contract for construction of improvements on that land. That does not follow in the case of statutory corporations, particularly when it is contemplated that the statutory corporation may not operate the facility to be constructed or even continue to own the land. 
     
      
       
      
    69 Further, the proposition that the Minister was acting as agent for HAC is at odds with the subsequent legislation which transferred the land but made no express reference to the rights and obligations arising pursuant to the contracts between the Minister and BLL. 
     
      
       
      
    70 For these reasons the agency submissions are rejected. 
     
      
       
      
    71 In the circumstances I do not see it as necessary to travel through or determine any of the other issues which would have arguably been required to be determined, had BLL failed on the issues referred to above. 
     
      
       
      
    Statutory vesting of right to sue BLL 
     
      
       
      
    72 Notwithstanding it being strictly unnecessary to do so, that in light of the decision that the Referee's finding of a duty of care was incorrect, I propose to deal with the Referee’s decision that SOPA acquired a cause of action against BLL by virtue of statutory 'vesting'. 
     
      
       
      
    73 In my view that decision was incorrect. The reasons which follow generally adopt the submissions of BLL. 
     
      
       
      
    74 The Referee found (Report [64]) that a duty of care was owed to HAC by BLL, and that HAC’s “correlative right” in respect thereof, “devolved” to SOPA through its statutory predecessors and by operation of the vesting provisions in the Olympic Co-Ordination Authority Dissolution Act 2002.  
     
      
       
      
    75 Earlier, at Report [57], the Referee observed that:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
         “The vesting provisions of that Act included the transfer to SOPA of the assets, rights and liabilities of the [Olympic Park] Authority [subject to some exclusions] vesting without the need for any conveyance or assignment.” 
         
        
       
       
      
    76 The Referee found (Report [64]) that HAC’s “right” [the nature and content of which he did not articulate, beyond describing it as “correlative”] was to be treated as “falling within the definition of the interests so vested in SOPA.” The “definition” to which the Referee referred was that set out at Report [58], where the Referee said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Where reference was made to assets, rights and liabilities that reference carried the following meanings:  
          
          
         • In relation to  
         assets 
          it meant “any legal or equitable estate or interest (whether present or future and whether vested or contingent) in real or personal property of any description (including money), and includes securities, choses in action and documents.  
          
          
         •  
         Liabilities 
          meant “any liabilities, debts or obligations (whether present or future and whether vested or contingent).  
          
          
         •  
         Rights 
          meant “any rights, powers, privileges or immunities (whether present or future and whether vested or contingent).  
          
          
         I have referred to those definition provisions as I think they have some bearing on the assessment of SOPA’s entitlement to bring proceedings in tort.” 
         
        
       
      
    77 Hence on the basis on which the Referee had earlier determined the duty of care issue, the question of whether the right to sue BLL in tort had “devolved” to SOPA involved a process of statutory construction: namely, whether each of the chain of statutes was effective to transfer from HAC to SOPA, something which gave SOPA the entitlement to sue BLL in negligence. 
     
      
       
      
    78 The Referee did not expressly state where, within the foregoing definitions, the “correlative right” which he found was bestowed on HAC fell, but it would seem likely that he regarded it as within the definition of “rights”. However, as BLL has submitted, whatever “correlative right” was transferred to and vested in SOPA by the legislative scheme, that “right” cannot, by that scheme, be elevated higher than any “right” which was enjoyed by HAC. It follows that, because prior to the dissolution of HAC (i) there had been no act or omission with want of reasonable care on the part of BLL and (ii) HAC itself had suffered no loss or damage, no ‘complete’ right to sue in negligence could have been conveyed from HAC to its successors. In that sense, whatever “correlative right” HAC enjoyed by reason of BLL owing a duty of care to it, that “correlative right” was inchoate.  
     
      
       
      
    79 An alternative interpretation of the reasoning by which the Referee concluded that SOPA, which came into existence more than seven years after the Aquatic Centre was constructed, had a right to sue BLL in negligence, is that he regarded the “correlative right” that vested in SOPA as a chose in action and therefore an “asset” within the first limb of the definitions. If that were a correct interpretation of the Referee’s reasoning, then that also suffers from an error of law, for the reasons that follow. 
     
      
       
      
    80 A chose in action has been defined as “a known legal expression used to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical possession”: Torkington v Magee [1902] 2 KB 427 at 430 per Channell J; as “a right enforceable by action, or the right of action itself” [Butterworths Australian Legal Dictionary p192]; and as “a right of proceeding in a court of law to ... recover pecuniary damages for the infliction of a wrong...” [Osborn’s Concise Law Dictionary p73]. Because no damage was suffered by HAC, a necessary element of the tort of negligence was missing at the time of HAC’s dissolution and, accordingly, there was no right which could be enforced by action and thus no “chose in action”. 
     
      
       
      
    81 A further problem facing the proposition that there was vested in SOPA, a right to sue BLL in negligence arises from the general principle that a right of action for damages in tort is incapable of assignment either at law or equity: Poulton v Commonwealth (1952-1953) 89 CLR 540 per Fullagar J at first instance at 571, and per Williams, Webb and Kitto JJ (on appeal) at 602.  
     
      
       
      
    82 Starke’s Assignments of Choses in Action in Australia (Butterworths, 1972) cites (at paragraph 56) Poulton as authority for the proposition that a right to sue for damages for tort is not a statutorily assignable chose in action:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
         “Rights signified by expression “ 
         legal chose in action 
         ” – the expression ‘legal chose in action’, used in the Australian enactments, does not signify legal choses in action in the strict sense, but embraces all legal rights which before these enactments were lawfully assignable, such as those legal choses in action which were treated in equity as being assignable, as well as other rights recognised as assignable. Thus the benefits of rights under covenants or contracts are statutorily assignable, whereas a bare right to sue for damages for a past breach of a contract, and contractual or other rights under agreements involving special personal qualifications, are not.  
         In that connexion, it would appear that a right to sue for damages for tort is not a statutorily assignable chose in action. 
         ” 
         
        
       
       
      
    83 Such a conclusion accords with the principle of statutory construction that legislation is presumed not to alter common law doctrines and is presumed not to invade common law rights. In Potter & Minahan (1908) 7 CLR 277 O’Connor J at 304 cited Maxwell on Statutes (ed 4), p121: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         “It is in the last degree improbable that the legislature would overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights or depart from the general system of law without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness; and to give any such effect to general words, simply because they have that meaning in their widest, or usual or natural sense, would be to give them a meaning in which they were not really used.”  
          
         
        
       
       
       This passage has been endorsed by the High Court in subsequent decisions: see  
       Bropho v State of Western Australia 
        (1990) 171 CLR 1 at 18;  
       Coco v The Queen 
        (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437.  
        
       
      
    84 The presumption has been held to operate such that legislation will, in the absence of an unambiguous contrary intention, be interpreted ‘so as to be in consonance with the principles of equity’: Minister for Lands and Forests v McPherson (1991) 22 NSWLR 687. In McPherson, the Court of Appeal held that the power in the Supreme Court, exercising its equitable jurisdiction, to provide relief against forfeiture was not removed because there was no clear intention to do so in the statute under consideration. 
     
      
       
      
    85 Hence, as a matter of construction of each of the statutes which transferred or vested “assets”, the expression “chose in action” does not include a bare right to sue in tort: this is because the mere inclusion of the term ‘choses in action’ in the definition of ‘asset’ does not express ‘with irresistible clearness’ an intention to achieve a result so discordant with equity’s prohibition on such assignments. 
     
      
       
      
    86 Thus even if HAC had enjoyed a right of action in tort against BLL, the vesting provisions to which the Referee referred did not operate to assign or vest such a bare right of action. As a minimum, it would be necessary for the statute to state in the clearest of terms that the vesting provisions included causes of action arising from breaches of duties of care owed to HAC and thereby assigned the benefit of such duties to HAC’s successors. 
     
      
       
      
    87 SOPA submitted that the words of the statutes were extremely wide and were sufficient to transfer both present and future ""assets"" and ""rights"". To my mind that proposition simply does not address the issue as to whether a duty of care in respect of which there has been no breach and no damage is either an ""asset"" or “right"". Hence the authorities relied upon by SOPA [Monk v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (1994) 34 NSWLR 148 and Trendex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679] are not of assistance as they involve the assignment of complete rights of action in tort, not merely the purported transfer or assignment of a 'duty of care' which has not yet been breached. 
     
      
       
      
    88 As BLL has submitted prior to breach, a duty of care which is ""owed"" is an ‘obligation’ on the part of the person by whom the duty is owed: it is not a 'right' which is held by the person or persons to whom it is owed which is capable of enforcement. Until damage is suffered [or, alternatively, at least until breach], the 'duty of care' has no ""correlative right"" which is capable of enforcement in law or equity. To assign a completed right of action is one thing. To purport to assign the benefit of an obligation to take reasonable care is quite another – particularly, as in this case, where the duty arises because of the particular 'vulnerability' of the transferor. 
     
      
       
      
    89 Indeed and as further submitted by BLL, if no duties were owed independently to the assignee, it is difficult to see how the person owing the duty to the assignor is to know what is required to discharge the duty to the assignee, who may be in a quite different position to the assignor in terms of knowledge, experience or capacity. I accept that because any duty of care not to cause pure economic loss depends on the particular personal characteristics of the person claiming the benefit of the duty, such a duty of care is a truly personal obligation which is simply not apt to be assigned. 
     
      
       
      
    90 Even if BLL did owe a duty of care to HAC not to cause pure economic loss to it, that obligation, if not breached prior to the dissolution of HAC in January 1992, simply ceased to exist at the moment of dissolution. There was simply nothing to be passed on to any of HAC's successors, including in their capacity as registered proprietors of the land. 
     
      
       
      
    91 Of course it must be remembered that the Referee did not find that there was a duty owed by BLL directly to any of the subsequent registered proprietors of the land. This follows from the decision in Woolcock.Short minutes of order 
     
      
       
      
    92 The parties are to bring in short minutes of order on which occasion costs may be argued. At the same time if SOPA contends that bearing in mind the approach taken in the reasons, the Court has inadvertently failed to treat with a submission put by it and requiring to be treated with, leave is granted to raise that matter for the Court’s consideration.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 On 26 July 2007, the prisoners Etuate Taiseni, Taniela Taufa Motuapuaka, Joseph Leota, and Aminiasi Tuifua each pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Shane Miles and guilty to maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, in company, upon Gerard Meehan. Both offences occurred at the Bells Hotel in Woolloomooloo on 18 December 2004. The indictment presented against the four prisoners charged each of them with the murder of Shane Joseph Miles. However, the Crown accepted, in full discharge of the indictment, the guilty pleas offered in respect of the manslaughter charge that appeared as an alternative count. 
     
      
    2 The basis of the acceptance of the plea to manslaughter is that each of the four prisoners is liable for the death of Shane Miles, which was caused by impact between the victim’s head and a bar stool, while the prisoners were participating in a joint criminal enterprise to inflict harm upon Gerard Meehan. All four prisoners contemplated as a possible incident of carrying out the joint criminal enterprise that one of them would commit an unlawful and dangerous act, objectively carrying with it an appreciable risk of serious injury to a person, although the prisoners did not contemplate that such an act would be done with the intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    3 The basis of the plea to the charge in relation to Gerard Meehan was that each of the four prisoners are responsible for the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon that person whilst in the company of each other, on the basis that there was a joint criminal enterprise between them to inflict harm upon Gerard Meehan. The prisoner Leota directly caused grievous bodily harm to Mr Meehan by throwing a chair at him, whilst the remaining prisoners were present and participating in the joint criminal enterprise. Each of the four prisoners contemplated that one of them might do an act causing an appreciable risk of serious injury. 
     
      
    4 The maximum penalty for the crime of manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the crime of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm in company is 10 years imprisonment. The prisoners Taiseni and Leota ask that a further offence of supply heroin be taken into account when sentencing each of them for the offence of manslaughter. That offence came to light when the police intercepted the prisoners’ mobile phone communications and heard each of them discussing the sale of that drug. 
     
      
    5 Before proceeding with these remarks, it is important to place the particular type of manslaughter for which the prisoners stand to be sentenced in its proper context. As the former Chief Justice of this State, the present Chief Justice of Australia, noted in R v Blacklidge NSWCCA 12 December 1995 :- 
     
      
       
        
        The crime of manslaughter comprehends all forms of punishable homicide other than murder ( 
        Crimes Act 1900,  
        s18 
        ). 
         For presently relevant purposes, the crime of murder is taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, causing death, was done with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, or with reckless indifference to human life. Some forms of manslaughter, ….. , involve conduct which would amount to murder, except for the presence of some recognised mitigating circumstance. Other forms of manslaughter, sometimes referred to as ""involuntary"", do not involve an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, or reckless indifference to human life. They may, for example, involve causing death by an unlawful and dangerous act.  
         
        It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability.  
         
        At the same time, the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of a human life. That is the starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case. ( 
        R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349; R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402.) 
          
        
       
      
    6 The manslaughter offence for which the prisoners face sentence does not involve an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon Mr Miles, or reckless indifference to his life. The circumstances giving rise to the tragic death of Mr Miles are centred upon a trivial and pathetic dispute between the prisoner Leota and Mr Meehan regarding the use of the pool table in the Bells Hotel in the late hours of 17 December 2004. In what can only be described as a brutish, cowardly and uncivilised response to his rebuff by Mr Meehan and his friends, Mr Leota called for re-enforcements and returned to the hotel shortly after midnight with his co-offenders, in order to have his revenge upon Mr Meehan. The prisoners Motuapuaka and Leota pursued Mr Meehan, using the hotel furniture as weapons, raising a bar stool and a chair and throwing them at Mr Meehan as he sought shelter behind the bar. Mr Miles, who was behind the bar, was the innocent victim in this display of senseless violence. He was struck forcefully with the bar stool when the prisoner Motuapuaka swung the bar stool at Mr Meehan. 
     
      
    7 Whilst the starting point in this sentencing exercise is the unlawful taking of a human life, and one that was precious to the victim’s extended family with whom he worked, played and lived, the sentence to be imposed at law is constrained by the basis upon which the plea has been entered. The law demands that the prisoners be sentenced for an offence that is, objectively speaking, at the lower end of the available range, the upper limit of which is the maximum penalty. That maximum penalty encompasses the very broad range of manslaughter offences to which the Chief Justice refers in Blacklidge, including manslaughter offences that would otherwise be characterised as murder, but for the presence of a mental illness in the offender, or provocation, or excessive self-defence.  
     
      
    8 The Court is acutely conscious that this explanation offers nothing in the way of consolation to Mr Miles’ family. The victim impact statement speaks eloquently of the far-reaching effects upon his family and upon their business in the aftermath of his death. No one could fail to be moved by the fact that the family faced the heartbreaking decision of terminating Mr Miles’ life support in the days before Christmas 2004, when Mr Miles was but 47 years of age. It is understandable that the family's grief and loss have driven them to seek a penalty commensurate with the lifelong loss of a son, brother, uncle, friend and colleague. But the Court cannot sentence solely on the basis of the consequences of the prisoners’ conduct. It must also sentence on the basis of the criminality inherent in the prisoners’ conduct, as that conduct has been defined by the plea, that is, the doing of an unlawful and dangerous act, absent an intention to kill or inflict serious harm upon Mr Miles. 
     
      
    9 The events of 17 and 18 December 2004 and the actions of each of the prisoners are set out in a statement of agreed facts. I do not propose to repeat them in full. I have already indicated in short form how the offences were committed. However, it is relevant to note the following aspects of the facts, in so far as it is necessary to determine whether any one of the prisoners is more culpable than another. 
     
      
    10 As I have related, the prisoner Leota attended the Bells Hotel in the evening of 17 December 2004 with a friend, and later fell into an argument with a number of customers of the hotel, including Mr Meehan. The prisoner Leota provoked the ensuing fight by hitting a member of Mr Meehan’s group. It was only then that Mr Meehan joined in, punching Leota. As a result, the prisoner was escorted out of the hotel by the victim's brother, Danny Miles shortly after 11 p.m. As he was leaving, Leota said to Mr Meehan ""I'll get you back for this"". 
     
      
    11 Some five minutes later, Shane Miles went outside the hotel and spoke to Leota. Leota was heard to say to Mr Miles ""I've got a fat lip and he took a cheap shot. I want him outside."" Leota then made a call on his mobile phone saying ""Bring the boys down the Bells Hotel and clean this joint out"". Shortly afterwards Leota was heard to say ""I'm not just going to let someone cut me up for nothing"". A bartender at the hotel told Leota to go home but Leota replied ""no, this isn't over"" and ""I'm gonna call my boys, this isn't over, Shane"". At this time Leota was seen trying to make a call on his mobile phone. 
     
      
    12 From about 11:22 p.m. Leota made a series of phone calls to the prisoners Taiseni and Motuapuaka. These two offenders travelled with the prisoner Tuifua from the Villawood area to Woolloomooloo where they met the prisoner Leota. 
     
      
    13 At about 12:44 a.m. the four prisoners entered the Bells Hotel from Cowper Wharf Road. Mr Meehan was standing near the bar. The sight of four physically large Islander males entering the hotel caused one of Mr Meehan’s group to run behind the bar and tell Danny Miles to call the police. One of the prisoners approached Mr Meehan and asked him to go outside to talk. Mr Meehan refused. Mr Meehan then moved quickly towards the bar and was chased by Tuifua, Taiseni and Motuapuaka. As Mr Meehan approached the bar, Tuifua grabbed hold of his red T-shirt, causing the T-shirt to tear. 
     
      
    14 Motuapuaka then picked up a wooden bar stool and raised it above his head. As Mr Meehan was going behind the bar, Shane Miles approached Mr Meehan from inside the bar area and attempted to stop him. Motuapuaka then swung the bar stool with considerable force towards Mr Meehan, glancing off the shoulder of a barmaid before striking the head of Shane Miles. Mr Miles’ skull was extensively fractured and he suffered brain damage as a result of the blow. 
     
      
    15 Mr Meehan continued to move further behind the bar, past Shane Miles who lay on the floor. Motuapuaka followed Mr Meehan on the opposite side of the bar, then stood near the corner of the bar and threw objects over the bar at Mr Meehan, including glasses and bottles from nearby tables. 
     
      
    16 Leota meanwhile moved to the other end of the bar and threw a chair over the bar at Mr Meehan. Mr Meehan was struck in the face and fell to the ground. Leota then went behind the bar to where Mr Meehan was lying and kicked Mr Meehan to the head. The injuries sustained by Mr Meehan as a result of this assault are the subject of the maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm count. Mr Meehan’s upper lip required suturing and his teeth and jaw required ongoing medical and surgical attention. 
     
      
    17 Whilst this was happening, Taiseni and Tuifua were standing near to Motuapuaka. Tuifua left the hotel, shortly before Motuapuaka threw yet another chair towards Mr Meehan. Taiseni then moved towards Motuapuaka, placing a hand on his shoulder, indicating that they should leave. At that point the three remaining offenders left the hotel. When police arrived a few minutes later, they were no longer at the scene. 
     
      
    18 Notwithstanding that the prisoners became aware in the days and weeks after these events that Shane Miles had been fatally injured and the police were seeking the offenders by way of broadcasting the CCTV footage from the hotel on the evening news, the prisoners regularly spoke to each other and to other persons, minimising their respective role in these events and discussing the false accounts that they would offer to the police if questioned. To some extent, this false bravado continued following their arrest, and in the case of Motuapuaka, in the answers that he gave to police in his record of interview. 
     
      
    19 Significantly, the account given by Motuapuaka in his record of interview suggested that they had gone back into the hotel in order to get Leota’s wallet which he claimed he had dropped in the hotel. When asked what he was trying to do when he picked up the bar stool, Motuapuaka said that they were just trying to stop Mr Meehan ""because he was the one that got the wallet"". This was an explanation taken up by Taiseni in the course of giving evidence on the sentencing proceedings. However Leota acknowledged in cross-examination that the fight with Mr Meehan was unconnected with the loss of his wallet. The prisoners Motuapuaka and Tuifua did not give evidence on sentence. Even if Taiseni and Motuapuaka were told of Leota’s loss of a wallet, I do not accept that it played any part in the decision to enter the hotel and seek out Mr Meehan for punishment. 
     
      
    20 Objectively, the manslaughter offence is a serious example of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. Not content to confine themselves to the use of their fists, which given their physical size would have been potentially dangerous in any event, the prisoners Motuapuaka and Leota took to throwing around heavy items of furniture in a public bar that was still occupied by a number of law-abiding patrons, and staff of the hotel.  
     
      
    21 Similarly, the objective gravity of the grievous bodily harm offence is towards the upper end of the range, given that it was a sustained, callous and planned assault. The sort of mindless mob violence implicit in both offences is deplorable. Each offence deserves a penalty that reflects general deterrence in a significant respect.  
     
      
    22 It should be obvious from the summary of the events inside the hotel that Leota played the principle role in the commission of both offences. He sent out the rallying call, and led the charge, all because another man got the better of him in a fight that he started. He was directly responsible for striking Mr Meehan and kicking him whilst he was on the ground. Motuapuaka was directly responsible for wielding the stool that struck Mr Miles and would have continued to throw furniture at Mr Meehan, in spite of the fact that Mr Miles and Mr Meehan both lay on the floor behind the bar, had Taiseni not intervened. It is difficult to separate these two prisoners in terms of their culpability. 
     
      
    23 Taiseni and Tuifua stand in a somewhat different category. Neither of these prisoners were seen to engage directly in physical violence and Taiseni played some part in ending the assault upon Mr Meehan by Motuapuaka. That said, their presence in the hotel was nonetheless designed to confront Mr Meehan in particular with the force of numbers. I do not take that into account by way of an aggravating circumstance, given that the offence against Mr Meehan includes the element of “in company” and the manslaughter offence is based on a joint criminal enterprise. However, it is relevant in terms of explaining the role played by them. It must be said that in the context of the assaults upon Mr Miles and Mr Meehan, the culpability of Taiseni and Tuifua is well below that of their co-offenders. 
     
      
    24 I turned to the subjective circumstances of the prisoner Motuapuaka. He is presently 26 years of age. He was born and spent his childhood in Tonga, where he was brought up by foster parents. At the age of 13 he moved to Sydney to live with the family of his foster parents’ daughter and to continue his education. He obtained his HSC at Fairfield High School where he excelled in sport and continued to play rugby league for Cabramatta, Manly and a private league based in Canberra. He trained as a security guard and worked between rugby league fixtures as a security guard instructor. He is said to be a regular churchgoer and has undertaken charitable work. He has also undertaken professional audio engineering work for commercial companies. He married in 2002 and has two children, aged two and four years. 
     
      
    25 In 2002 and 2003 he was using cocaine and amphetamines to assist him in training. He denied having any problem with the consumption of alcohol. Motuapuaka gave an account to a consultant psychiatrist for the purposes of a report dated 16 August 2007 that on the night of the offence he had ingested two lines of amphetamines, two lines of cocaine and taken one or two ecstasy tablets. He also gave an account to that psychiatrist of the events inside the hotel which is inconsistent with the CCTV footage and which was not, in any event, able to be tested by cross-examination.  
     
      
    26 It appears that since his incarceration on 3 March 2005 he has been treated from time to time with antipsychotic medication because of ongoing depression. Motuapuaka has a criminal history of minor assaults and traffic offences recorded in local courts. I accept that he is genuinely remorseful for these offences. His prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable, although it is a matter of some concern that his occupation as a security guard suggests a taste for physical confrontation. 
     
      
    27 Motuapuaka offered a plea to manslaughter in April of this year at his arraignment. However that plea was not accepted until the date fixed for trial. In those circumstances it seems appropriate to allow for a discount of 20% in recognition of the utilitarian value of the plea and the timing of that offer. 
     
      
    28 The prisoner Leota is presently 29 years of age. He was also born in Tonga and was residing with his wife in Woolloomooloo, whom he married in 2000, at the time of the offences. A psychologist’s report of 1 August 2007 records a history of poly-substance abuse, predominantly alcohol. He claims that he had been drinking spirits since the early afternoon of 17 December 2004, although he did not drink alcohol in the hotel. He ingested cocaine after leaving the hotel on the first occasion.  
     
      
    29 The prisoner commenced his education in Tonga, continued it in primary school in Auckland, New Zealand until about year 4 and then completed his primary education at Granville public school. He obtained his HSC at Granville Boys High School.  
     
      
    30 Mr Leota’s early life was marked by dislocation from his family, living with cousins, uncles and a grandmother to whom he was emotionally close. When he finally rejoined his parents in Australia in 1987, he was not happy in that environment and returned to New Zealand looking for his grandmother who has since died.  
     
      
    31 He has worked in various unskilled occupations, including labourer, packer, demolisher and is currently enrolled in a TAFE apprenticeship course in metal fabrication and welding. He works in the metal shop in the prison. The references and certificates of achievement since he was taken into custody on 3 March 2005 indicate that he is making positive progress within the present system. His criminal history is largely irrelevant, given that it consists almost entirely of driving offences at a summary level. I accept that he is genuinely remorseful for these offences. 
     
      
    32 The prisoner Leota offered a plea to manslaughter on the day the matter was fixed for trial. In those circumstances, and taking into account the likely six-week duration of the trial, it is appropriate to allow a discount of 10% for the utilitarian value of that plea. His prospects of rehabilitation are moderate if he does not refrain from substance abuse. Otherwise, there is no reason to think he will commit such serious offences in the future. 
     
      
    33 The prisoner Taiseni was born into a Mormon community in Tonga. He is presently 30 years of age. His father is a bishop. He came to Australia with his brothers and one sister at the age of 15 without any skills in the English language. He was at Granville Boys High School for two years before leaving after year 10 and was without employment for the following two years. Shortly prior to his arrest he was working in a factory. He has at various times been a trainee butcher, a bricklayer and a labourer. Mr Taiseni played rugby union at third and fourth grade level for Parramatta. He married in 2000 and has two sons, aged six and five. His criminal history has a number of entries for assault and possess prohibited weapon and a number of driving offences at a summary level. 
     
      
    34 Mr Taiseni gave an account of drinking half a case of beer by himself on the night of the offences. The evidence establishes that this prisoner was in the hotel for approximately 2 minutes, during which time he did not strike anyone, throw anything or swing any punches at any one.  
     
      
    35 The offer of a plea of guilty at arraignment was not accepted by the Crown. For the same reasons as apply in the case of Motuapuaka, this prisoner is entitled to a discount of 20% for the utilitarian value of his plea. I accept that this prisoner is also genuinely remorseful for the consequences of the offences. He has good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    36 The prisoner Tuifua is 33 years of age. He was born in Tonga, the second eldest of nine children. The family enjoyed an average standard of living and were regular churchgoers. He completed the School Certificate in Tonga, and attempted to enter professional rugby between 1989 and 1997. He lived with his parents until 1997 when, at the age of 23, he came to Australia. He met his wife in Melbourne in 1998 where he was regularly employed and moved to Sydney in 2002. His employment has consisted of manual labour. His wife's employment has allowed the prisoner to stay at home and care for his four children. He hopes to obtain employment as a welder after his release from custody and has undertaken welding course in gaol, with some promise. 
     
      
    37 The prisoner did not commence consuming alcohol until 1995 when the realisation dawned that he would not have a professional football career. Whilst at times he acknowledged binge drinking, on the whole he only consumed alcohol on weekends. The prisoner had not consumed alcohol on the day of the offence and it was for that reason that he was asked to drive Motuapuaka and Leota to Woolloomooloo. The prisoner Taiseni was a close friend and he knew the other prisoners from church, social rugby games and family connections. Once inside the hotel, the prisoner simply felt constrained not to interfere with the demand for revenge, and now feels genuinely contrite for the consequences of that conduct and his failure to assist the victims.  
     
      
    38 He has no prior convictions. His prospects of rehabilitation are excellent. The prisoner offered to plead guilty on the day fixed for trial. A discount of 10% properly reflects the utilitarian value of those pleas. 
     
      
    39 In the case of each prisoner, I find special circumstances on the basis that the sentences I am about to impose represent the first time that each of them have entered custody. However, the period of time that each prisoner actually spends in custody must also reflect the objective gravity of the offences. There must be a degree of accumulation in order to express the totality of the criminality of these two offences, particularly given that each of them relates to a separate victim. 
     
      
    40 Accordingly, I propose to sentence as follows :-

     Andrew Pierre Hamieh v Regina 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I agree with Rothman J.  
     
      
    2 ROTHMAN J: Andrew Pierre Hamieh supplied just over 2kg of methylamphetamine. He supplied the drugs to his co-offender, David Hood. Mr Hamieh was charged and convicted, after having pleaded guilty to the charge. Mr Hamieh was sentenced in the District Court to a non-parole period of 7 years’ imprisonment and a balance, being the remainder of term, of a further 4 years. Mr Hood, his co-offender, was sentenced by another judge to a non-parole period of 5 years’ imprisonment with a balance of term of a further 2 years and 9 months.  
     
      
    3 Mr Hamieh has applied for leave to appeal, feeling, he submits, a justifiable sense of grievance with his sentence, compared to the sentence imposed on his co-offender. He also raises issues of error in the remarks of the sentencing judge. In order to determine the questions of leave to appeal and, if leave be granted, the appeal, it is necessary to restate briefly the principles to be applied in relation to alleged disparity in sentence, the circumstances of the offence, the appropriate comparison of the culpability of the offenders and their subjective circumstances and whether, if the sentences be properly described as disparate, a lower sentence is appropriate. It is also appropriate to deal with the other alleged errors.  
     
      
    The Parity Principle 
     
      
    4 The principles applied by sentencing courts (and on appeal therefrom) in relation to parity are well established. The parity principle is a manifestation of the application of the principles of equal justice. It requires that like should be treated alike and, where there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for such differences: Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301, per Dawson and Gaudron JJ; R v Tiddy [1969] SASR 575 at 577.  
     
      
    5 Discrepancy, of itself, is not sufficient to warrant intervention by an appellate court. The discrepancy, viewed objectively, must be unjustifiable, the difference in sentence being unjustifiable on the objective and/or subjective differences in the co-offenders. Even when such unjustifiable differences occur, an appellate court will not intervene if the result of intervention would be to reduce the sentence of an offender to a level which would be inappropriate for the offence in question: McKenna v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 113 at [48]-[55].  
     
      
    Circumstances of Offence 
     
      
    6 As a result of a police strike force named Bindupi, police intercepted numerous telephone calls between Mr Hamieh and his co-accused Mr Hood. There were also telephone calls between each of Mr Hamieh and Mr Hood and other persons. Those phone calls related to the supply of a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. At the time of those phone calls, Mr Hood, the co-accused, was residing in South Australia.7 On Saturday 1 March 2003, police intercepted a particular telephone conversation between Mr Hamieh and Mr Hood. During this conversation Mr Hamieh said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""But ah, all’s I wanted to see if your comin’ down for the, for the elbows."" 
        
       
      
    Mr Hood replied: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mate, I'm just absolutely, I fucking can't get them. They're payin' thirty five for them here and I'm, I just can't pay that."" 
        
       
      
    It is accepted that the above conversation refers to a price of a pound of pure amphetamine as being $35,000 at his location. 
     
      
    8 On Saturday 22 March 2003, the police intercepted a further telephone conversation between Mr Hamieh and Mr Hood. In that conversation Mr Hood said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I'm only coming for the um, ah, you know, the wet one."" 
        
       
      
    Mr Hamieh replied: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Yeah. But the wet one, I've tried my hardest mate. I tried, honestly, all right. I can only manage fifty for two, Bro. So it's like, it's a hundred and twenty five all up, Bro. . . Because I've got, I've got a lot of cost. I'm incurring, I've gotta get a delivery guy. I've gotta someone to deliver it to us. . . Yeah, ‘cause I'm only out, out of the whole, I'm, I'm putting um, it’s costin’ me for two I'm getting it for forty seven. 
         
         
        Yeah? So just say that’s four, that’s I’m making six. Nah. Say, say I’m makin’ around seven, eight grand, ya know? And then after all I put all my costs involved, that’s three grand. I come out with maybe five thousand on it. I think that’s reasonable. You reckon? You reckon? 
         
         
        The accused then says “Monday?” 
         
         
        And the co-accused Hood says “Ah, yeah, Monday. Now I’ll give ya a ring um, when I’m sort of you know, close, close by, sort of thing.” 
         
         
        The accused says “The best thing to do is just we’ll do, we’ll do it next to my house, ya know. My actual house.” 
        
       
      
    Detective Sergeant Smith is of the opinion that the conversation is in code and means that the wet one is pure amphetamine and they were discussing Hood purchasing 2 kilograms of pure amphetamine for $50,000 per kilogram. The accused was also discussing his profit from the transaction. The reference to “… it’s a hundred and twenty five all up …” is a reference to the sum of $125,000. 
     
      
    9 As a result of this conversation, police commenced surveillance of the premises of Mr Hamieh. On Monday 24 March 2003, Mr Hood informed Mr Hamieh that he was expected from South Australia in Sydney about 3pm. In a later conversation on that day, Mr Hood informed Mr Hamieh that he was on the Hume Highway coming onto the freeway. Informed of that, Mr Hamieh told Mr Hood to come directly to his place, giving him directions for that purpose. 
     
      
    10 Mr Hamieh's brother, Nabil Jazzini, was sent to collect Mr Hood and bring him to Mr Hamieh's house. Both Mr Hood and Mr Hamieh arrived at Mr Hamieh's house at about the same time, 5pm 24 March 2003. 
     
      
    11 Shortly thereafter the drug transaction occurred between Mr Hamieh and Mr Hood. Mr Hamieh discussed in a telephone conversation that Mr Jazzini would be paid $500 for each delivery. In a further telephone conversation, Mr Hamieh said that he had the money and the transaction was completed. 
     
      
    12 Mr Hood and Mr Jazzini left the house in separate vehicles. Mr Hood followed Mr Jazzini to the address of Mr Hamieh's (and Mr Jazzini's) parents in Auburn. Mr Jazzini entered the premises. Police could not see him and Mr Hood for about 10 minutes. Each of them left the area and travelled to the Chester Hill area at which time they were stopped by police and arrested. Mr Jazzini was in possession of a mobile phone in a false name; Mr Hood was in the possession of two mobile phones, each registered in his name. Each denied any involvement in the offence. 
     
      
    13 Having obtained a search warrant for the premises at Auburn, police searched the premises finding documents identifying Mr Jazzini in a black briefcase containing five packages totalling 2.1kg of methylamphetamine with the purity of 12%. Also in the briefcase were documents in the name of Mr Hood. In the wardrobe in which the briefcase was found, police found a plastic shopping bag containing $105,020 in cash. 
     
      
    14 Police arrested Mr Hamieh at his home at Lane Cove at which time, a search warrant having been obtained, police searched the premises and found numerous mobile phones and SIM cards. They also found $9,625 in cash; electronic scales; and an open box of Glucodin powder. Mr Hamieh was taken to the police station, he declined an interview and he was charged with the current offence. 
     
      
    15 The potential street value in March 2003 of the drugs found was between $450,000 and $610,000 (assuming a 5% purity). On 8 February 2005, Mr Hamieh first notified the Crown that he would plead guilty. The plea of guilty was entered before the court on 21 February 2005, adhered to on 22 April 2005, with submissions on sentencing being made on 22 April and 2 June 2005. Mr Hamieh was sentenced on 10 June 2005. 
     
      
    16 Mr Hood pleaded guilty on 23 February 2005 and was sentenced on 7 October 2005. The facts before the sentencing court for each of them were identical. Further, the Crown admitted that Mr Hamieh was not the principal in the transaction to which he was party. Mr Hood was regarded, at least if one were to refer to both sentencing proceedings, as a most senior figure in the distribution network in South Australia. 
     
      
    17 At the time of the commission of the offence, Mr Hamieh was on a bond arising from a previous offence. A Form 1 offence was included and taken into account by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    Alleged Errors in Sentencing 
     
      
    18 The first alleged error to which reference should be made concerns the categorisation of the role of Mr Hamieh. The sentencing judge came to the conclusion that Mr Hamieh ""was supplying on his own behalf"", which would classify him as a principal in the supply chain. The Crown (with the possible exception of a comment in supplementary submissions) expressly conceded that Mr Hamieh was not a principal and submitted that there was ""someone further up in the hierarchy who supplied those drugs to him"". 
     
      
    19 The finding that Mr Hamieh was supplying on his own behalf undermines the basis of the sentencing submissions on his behalf and gives rise to a factual context with which counsel for Mr Hamieh would have been required to deal, were he to have known of it. 
     
      
    20 On appeal, Mr Hamieh submits that the finding amounted to a denial of natural justice or procedural fairness. It cannot be stressed enough that it is for the prosecution alone to determine the charge that is preferred. It is for the defendant alone to determine the plea to that charge. And it is for the judge alone to determine the sentence to be imposed and to make findings of fact for that purpose. Nevertheless, where agreed facts are tendered to the court, and one or other party acts to its prejudice on the basis of those facts and/or a concession made in relation to them, it is procedurally unfair for a sentencing judge to act on any other basis without appropriate notice to the parties. 
     
      
    21 The Crown submits, correctly, that it was open to his Honour to find that Mr Hamieh was more than a ""mere commission agent of his supplier"". An analysis of the evidence displays a role for Mr Hamieh in negotiating price, obtaining supply, and calculating profit. However, while it is true that Mr Hamieh's role was not minor and he did not act merely as a commission agent, it is also true that Mr Hamieh was not supplying drugs on his own behalf, as found by his Honour, which if that were the finding would mean that he was supplying on behalf of another and, therefore, was not a principal. 
     
      
    22 The second major error to which Mr Hamieh points on this appeal is the failure, it is alleged, of his Honour to make a finding as to the objective seriousness of the offence in question. There are statements by the sentencing judge that deal with the issue, but no express finding on that question. His Honour concluded that the offence was not one that fell into the most serious category of offences of this type, and was correct so to do. 
     
      
    23 However, his Honour did not determine where, below the most serious category of offences, this offence fell. It seems, given the material before his Honour and the comments of his Honour, that his Honour concluded (or operated on the conclusion) the offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. If that were the case, his Honour would have been correct. It is necessary for a sentencing judge to determine the objective seriousness of the offence and to make that conclusion known either expressly or by words of necessary intendment. 
     
      
    24 In the present situation the words used are not sufficiently express, but it does not seem that his Honour erred in his approach to the offence, even if he may have erred in not sufficiently expressing it. 
     
      
    25 The third aspect of the alleged errors of his Honour, in sentencing, apart from the parity issue, relate to the subjective aspects that, it is said, were not properly considered by his Honour. Those subjective aspects of Mr Hamieh were: the fact that he suffers from a dissociative disorder; the failure to find otherwise good character; the comments on lack of remorse; and the relative age of Mr Hamieh compared to Mr Hood (24 years of age compared to 53 respectively). To the extent that it is necessary to deal with each of these issues, they are best dealt with after I deal with the parity issue. 
     
      
    Parity 
     
      
    26 It may be that the finding of his Honour that Mr Hamieh was a principal (or supplied on his own behalf) caused the sentencing judge to treat Mr Hamieh more harshly than might otherwise be the case. It may also be that the second sentencing judge treated Mr Hood less severely than Mr Hamieh on the basis of that finding. There is certainly no material upon which one could discern a relevant distinction in culpability between Mr Hamieh and Mr Hood that would be unfavourable to Mr Hamieh. 
     
      
    27 Mr Hamieh was sentenced first in time. Of itself, that timing does not preclude considerations of parity nor the correction of an unjustifiably disparate sentence: Jones v The Queen (1993) 67 ALJR 376. 
     
      
    28 A comparison of the subjective elements between Mr Hamieh and Mr Hood obviously points to differences. No two offenders are identical. Because of the Form 1 offence, his Honour declined to take into account Mr Hamieh's otherwise good character. It is impermissible to determine good character on the basis of the offences before the court: Lozanovski v R [2006] NSWCCA 143; Ryan v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 267 at 275. Nevertheless, good character may or may not have a significant role to play. Much will depend on the nature of the offences and on the criminal history of the offender. 
     
      
    29 Mr Hamieh submits that a true comparison would take account of the addiction of Mr Hood as showing past lack of good character. The Crown submits that Mr Hood's addiction must be seen in the light of the well-known categories of persons who are involved in the drug trade. It has been said (R v Liang, unreported, NSWCCA, 2 June 1995) that broadly speaking there are three categories of persons involved in the drug trade: those that use but do not sell; those who use and sell; and those who sell but do not use. The Crown submits that the addiction of Mr Hood shows him to be a person in the second category, namely, one who uses and sells. However, there is no suggestion that Mr Hood uses the same or similar kinds of drugs that he sells and the position of Mr Hood in the hierarchy of the drug supply chain in South Australia takes him well outside such a category. 
     
      
    30 A comparison of subjective elements must have regard to two most salient facts: the Form 1 offence in the case of Mr Hamieh; and that the offence for which Mr Hamieh was sentenced was committed whilst on conditional liberty. The latter aspect is one that the Court treats most seriously. 
     
      
    31 Against those issues one must bear in mind that Mr Hamieh is only 24 years of age. While that age does not allow Mr Hamieh to be treated as a juvenile he is, compared at least to Mr Hood, entitled to have afforded to his benefit a higher regard to the prospects of his rehabilitation and his lack of maturity. 
     
      
    32 Further, the sentencing judge had the benefit of a report from Dr Westmore, Clinical Psychiatrist. Dr Westmore opines that Mr Hamieh suffers from clinical depression and has done so for some period. He was involved in self-harm episodes and concludes that Mr Hamieh, at least arguably, came in contact with the criminal justice system as a result of his depression. Dr Westmore and Dr Stephenson each refer to his repeated episodes of dissociative disorder, sometimes associated with self-injury. 
     
      
    33 Dr Stephenson suggests that his dissociative state may account for his driving offences and his criminal conduct because he ""does not know what he is doing"". At the time of that report Mr Hamieh was denying the charge of drug dealing. 
     
      
    34 Ms Robilliard, Psychologist, also reported on Mr Hamieh. She described his test results as that which would generally be described as being indicative of ""a cry for help"". She concludes, ""[s]uch individuals are seldom able to be realistic about their problems at the point of testing, and while entrenched personality pathology is implicit, diagnostic categories cannot be selected out as the test instrument is overloaded."" Her opinion is that Mr Hamieh is ""deeply psychologically and emotionally troubled"" and ""entrenched personality pathology is implicit"". She concludes that Mr Hamieh ""has a repertoire of well-entrenched pathological patterns of behaviour. At this point he appears to have no self-insight.""35 These subjective elements have been given insufficient consideration by the sentencing judge. Different subjective elements relate to Mr Hood but do not account for the disparity. 
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    36 The submission on behalf of Mr Hamieh on the question of parity seeks to portray Mr Hamieh's role as significantly less than that of Mr Hood. I do not accept that there was error in likening the criminal culpability of each. However, the subjective elements that apply to Mr Hamieh counterbalance the aggravating aspects relating to the Form 1 offence and the factor associated with the commission of the offence whilst on conditional liberty. 
     
      
    37 Sentencing is not a mathematical exercise. In the circumstances of the relative culpability of Mr Hamieh and Mr Hood, and the differing subjective elements relating to each, which differing elements seem to weigh evenly in the balance, there is a justifiable, objectively ascertained, sense of grievance that might be held by Mr Hamieh in the disparity in sentence imposed on him as against that imposed on his co-offender. 
     
      
    38 Whatever be the effect of the subjective elements to which Mr Hamieh refers in this appeal, a sentence lower than that imposed on Mr Hood would be inappropriate. I propose a sentence very slightly above that imposed on Mr Hood. Those subjective elements also give rise to special circumstances. 
     
      
    39 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal be granted; 
       
       
      (ii) The sentence imposed on Andrew Pierre Hamieh on 10 June 2005 be quashed and in lieu thereof he be sentenced, taking into account the offence on the Form 1, to a non-parole period of five years and two months commencing 21 January 2005 and expiring on 20 March 2010 with the remainder of term of two years and seven months expiring on 20 December 2012.

    41 JAMES J: I agree with Rothman J. 
     
      
    42 ROTHMAN J: It has been pointed out that an error exists in the terms of the order issued on 21 September 2007 in this matter: Hamieh v R [2007] NSWCCA 277.  
     
      
    43 The remainder of the term, after the non-parole period, is expressed as “two years and seven months expiring on 20 December 2012.” 
     
      
    44 As is clear from the reasons for judgment (see [38] thereof), the judgment was intended to impose a sentence slightly above Mr Hamieh’s co-offender.  
     
      
    45 The original intention was that the remainder of sentence be two years and nine months (not two years and seven months) expiring on 20 December 2012. There may be circumstances where application of principles akin to double jeopardy may result in the correction not being made, and effect being given to the lower of the two possible expiry dates. This is not a case that calls for consideration of such an issue and the original intention ought to be given effect.  
     
      
    46 The Court will make the following correction to the order issued on 21 September 2007: 
     
      
       
      (i) Delete from Order (ii) the words “two years and seven months” and insert in lieu thereof “two years and nine months”.

    JUDGMENT1 I have to sentence Aaron Sittczenko for a pair of shocking sexual assaults and associated offences. Each of the two victims was sexually assaulted by him, more than once, on the same occasion. The two occasions were some two years apart, hence the two issues which were the main topics of submissions before me were the applicability of relevant standard non-parole periods and the extent to which the sentences should be concurrent or cumulative.2 This is what happened on the first occasion. It was a Saturday evening, 13 March 2004. The victim, whom I will not name in these reasons, was a fifty-two year old widow, who was at home at North St Marys. She had been feeling ill and had been vomiting during the day. She was lying on her bed. 3 Mr Sittczenko knocked on the door and asked after her husband and obtained information from the victim to the effect that her husband was dead. He then opened the door and walked inside. He then proceeded, once he was inside, to expose his penis to the victim. The victim understandably began to fear for her safety and walked out of the lounge room, where they were at that stage, towards the front door, but Mr Sittczenko walked past her, closed the front door and did not allow her to leave.4 The victim started screaming. Mr Sittczenko’s response was to punch her in the face several times with both his clenched fists, causing her pain. I should add here that the victim was aged fifty-two. He then grabbed her by the arms and pushed her onto the floor in the hallway. He punched her in the nose, in the left eye and the forehead with both his fists. He then inserted his penis into her vagina and had sexual intercourse without her consent. This lasted for some fifteen minutes in the hallway.5 After that he made her walk into a front bedroom and he pushed her onto a double mattress in that room ,so that she was lying face down on her stomach. Once again he inserted his penis into her vagina and had sexual intercourse with her, this time for some ten minutes. He withdrew his penis from her vagina and inserted it into her anus and had sexual intercourse with her, once again for about ten minutes. This caused her extreme pain in her anus.6 After this series of sexual assaults the victim saw Mr Sittczenko raiding her drawers and wardrobe in her bedroom. He said that he was looking for money for drugs. He demanded money from her. In fear for her safety she retrieved eighty-five dollars in cash from her purse. The victim then saw Mr Sittczenko remove her radio and disc player from the lounge room and he left the house and ran away from the scene.7 The victim was taken to the Nepean Hospital and treated for her injuries. Her injuries included bruising and swelling to her left eye and left cheek, bleeding and soreness to her mouth and nose, small scratches to her forehead, bruising to her left elbow and bruising and small tears to her vagina.8 Arising from that sequence of events, Mr Sittczenko was charged with the following offences. He was charged with three aggravated sexual assault offences under s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Each of those carried a maximum of twenty years imprisonment and each attracted a standard non-parole period of ten years. He was charged with aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence, contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. That carried a maximum of twenty years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of five years. He was charged with detaining the victim with an intention to obtain an advantage and occasioning actual bodily harm. That is an offence contrary to s 86(2)(b) of the Crimes Act carrying a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. He was charged with aggravated robbery contrary to s 95(1) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. Finally he was charged with stealing property from a dwelling, contrary to s 148 of the Crimes Act, and that carries a maximum of seven years imprisonment.9 One of the sexual assaults, namely the sexual assault perpetrated in the front bedroom, by Mr Sittczenko inserting his penis into the victim’s vagina and the stealing from the dwelling house, were placed on a list of additional charges, pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.10 Turning to the second series of offences, these occurred on 20 May 2006. In this case the victim was a fifteen year old girl. It was just after midnight, once again on a Saturday night perhaps a Sunday morning and the victim was walking along Forrester Road, Tregear, near her home. Mr Sittczenko was on a pushbike. He greeted her and looked at her in an intimidating manner. She felt scared and began to run away.11 Mr Sittczenko rode after her on his pushbike and caught up. When he caught up, he grabbed her and dragged her from the road into some long grass and bushes. He then forcibly removed all her clothing. The victim began screaming, but Mr Sittczenko’s response to that was to punch her three times to the left side of her head, causing her bruising and immense pain. In addition he said, “Stop screaming or I’ll hurt you real bad”. He then forced her onto her back and inserted his penis into her vagina and had sexual intercourse with her. He removed his penis from her vagina and forced it into her mouth placing his hand on the back of her head at the same time. Once again he removed his penis from her mouth but inserted it into her vagina. He again inserted his penis into her mouth this time ejaculating into her mouth. Finally he inserted his penis into her vagina once again.12 During the course of these events the victim’s mobile phone had been taken by Mr Sittczenko. Despite her having the presence of mind to ask for it back, he refused and threw it away. The victim ran to a nearby railway station and reported the events to a man there and by coincidence saw her cousin and she reported the incident to him. She then went on to the police station.13 Mr Sittczenko later admitted trying to break into, on the same occasion, a shop called Luxford Print in Forrester Road with a steel pole. His intention was to enter the shop and steal items of value. In addition he admitted to breaking and entering a café called First Choice Café in the same group of shops on Forrester Road. He smashed a glass panel, went into the shop and stole some coins.14 As a result of the Forrester Road events, Mr Sittczenko was charged with aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act.  I repeat that that carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of ten years. He was charged with two offences under that section and an additional three offences were placed on the list of additional charges, pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Those additional charges were an aggravated robbery, contrary to s 95(1) of the Crimes Act (that offence was committed by him stealing the victim’s mobile phone in the course of attacking her). In addition he was charged with attempting to break into the shop called Luxford Print which is an offence contrary to s 113(1) of the Crimes Act, and the offence of breaking and entering the café called First Choice Café contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act.15 Mr Sittczenko was at large for two years after the first set of offences, which were committed in 2004. He was arrested on 9 June 2006, some weeks after the second series of offences on 20 May 2006. He had been the subject of investigation on the day of the 2006 offences but there was not sufficient evidence to charge him at that stage. When he was arrested on 9 June 2006 police detected a DNA match between him and some semen from the 2004 series of crimes, so that he was charged with the 2004 crimes at the same time. 16 I record here that the description of the offences, which I have just given, I have taken from exhibit C which includes a statement of facts in respect of each of the series of offences and I note that Mr Sittczenko told the probation and parole officer, who interviewed him for a report, that he agreed with the police facts unconditionally.17 I should add for completeness that the statement of facts records that after he had been arrested and interviewed, he began to cry and the police facts note that he showed remorse for his actions and said that he did not initially admit the offences because he was too ashamed. He offered an apology to the victim during the police interview.18 I turn first to the objective seriousness of the various offences. The offences committed on 13 March 2004 are the ones which I will examine first. Assessing the objective seriousness of the sexual assaults on the fifty-two year old victim, I take the following into account. The victim was a widow who was attacked in her own home whilst she was alone. As it happened she was ill and in bed and therefore additionally vulnerable. The sexual assault which occurred in the hallway lasted some fifteen minutes. The sexual assault comprising Mr Sittczenko inserting his penis into the victim’s anus lasted some ten minutes as did the other sexual assault which occurred in the bedroom and which is on the form. The victim experienced extreme pain to her anus.19 I regard all three of the sexual assaults perpetrated on that day against that victim, as being comfortably in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Indeed I regard them as being towards the top of that range, because of the factors which I have mentioned. I have not taken into account factors which are part of the definition of the offences. I should note that I do not regard the sexual assaults as planned. They were, in my opinion, opportunistic offences committed by Mr Sittczenko when he entered the house in order to rob the house to obtain money.20 The balance of the offences committed on 13 March 2004 I regard as objectively serious, but in each case the element of aggravation for the break enter and commit serious offence, the aggravated detention and the aggravated robbery, is an adequate measure of its seriousness. In fact these three crimes were committed in the context of the much more serious offences which were the sexual assaults.21 Turing to the offences which occurred on 20 May 2006, I regard as adding to the objective seriousness of the two sexual assaults the fact that Mr Sittczenko pursued his victim and that she was alone and vulnerable at night in a suburban street, which I might add was not far from her home. The victim in this case was under sixteen years, which I do not take into account as an additional factor of aggravation, because it is part of the definition of the offence in this case. But I do take into account the violence which was perpetrated by Mr Sittczenko upon her and his threat which are additional factors of aggravation pursuant to s 61J(2)(a) and (b). Once again the aggravated robbery which was perpetrated by Mr Sittczenko taking the victim’s mobile phone as well as the two break and enters, were offences committed in a context of much more serious crimes on the same occasion.22 I turn now to the subjective matters. I have read Exhibit D which is the Pre-Sentence Report dated 5 September 2007 and exhibit 1, a report from a psychologist Misia Temler dated 31 August 2007. From those exhibits I take into the account the following subjective matters. I regard Mr Sittczenko’s remorse as immediate and genuine. I regard his plea of guilty as having been entered at the earliest opportunity, that is a concession which was made by the representative of the Crown and, I might add, appropriately so.23 I take into account a submission by Mr Sandilands that his client will be serving his sentence on protection. I do not give a great deal of weight to that factor but nevertheless, I take it into account. I do not give it a great deal of weight because I have no evidence before me of the impact of Mr Sittczenko serving his custody in protection. I take into account that he is presently aged twenty-four and that it is his first time in custody. I take into account a history recorded in both exhibits of domestic violence, to which Mr Sittczenko was exposed during his childhood, as well as a sexual assault which he was the victim of himself.24 I regard to Mr Sittczenko’s prospects of rehabilitation as good. Expanding a little on the prospects of rehabilitation, I regard them as good because of the fact that he has acknowledged and expressed his contrition for his crimes, early and genuinely, and because he has indicated that he is prepared to examine his behaviour and is prepared to undertake a custody based sex offender treatment program.25 Other matters which I should note briefly from the two exhibits are that he was in a relationship for some six months, when he was aged nineteen. I add that his age was the subject of correction in proceedings before me. He has had intermittent employment. I note also the following subjective feature, although it does not bring with it mitigation of his sentence. He has a long history of abuse of cannabis and alcohol. That abuse provided the motivation for his offending behaviour in 2004 when he attached the victim in her home at North St Marys. He was in fact looking for money or goods which could assist him in financing his alcohol and cannabis dependency. 26 I note from the Pre-Sentence Report an item concerning possession of prohibited goods in custody, which was the subject of a reprimand on 9 April 2007. I do not regard that as serious. I accept the evidence of Mr Sittczenko which he gave before me on 5 September 2007 to the effect that it was the lid of a tuna can which he had left on a bench rather than disposing of. There was another occasion when he failed to provide a urine sample but I accept that he was in a position where he found he could not do so and I accept his evidence that he is prepared to undertake random testing. And he also told me in evidence that he would undertake the courses in custody which were recommended. He confirmed his remorse to me in evidence as well. 27 I make the finding regarding the sexual offences not being planned based upon Mr Sittczenko reporting to the psychologist that they were both spur of the moment decisions.28 I turn now to consider the question of the standard non-parole periods and the question of accumulation or concurrency of the sentences which I need to impose given the findings I have made regarding the objective seriousness of the offending behaviour and Mr Sittczenko’s subjective features. As I have said, I regard the first set of offences committed in 2004 as being well within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Indeed, as I have said, I regard them as falling at the higher end of that range. However, I take into account as having some significance his plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity and his prospects of rehabilitation as well as his genuine remorse and the other factors which I have listed as subjective features. I accept that, because Mr Sittczenko has pleaded guilty, the standard non-parole period relevant to the two sexual assault offences in respect of which I am sentencing him which occurred in 2004 is not strictly applicable. It is nevertheless a benchmark or guideline which I take into account. Some attention was given to it in submissions, appropriately so in my opinion because of the seriousness of these offences. I do not propose to impose the standard non-parole period in respect of the two sexual assault offences committed in 2004. That is mainly because of a discount of twenty-five per cent which I propose to allow because Mr Sittczenko has pleased guilty at the earliest opportunity. In addition, in fixing sentences for those two sexual assaults I have taken into account and allowed a modest extra discount for the other subjective features. 29 So far as the 2006 offences are concerned, once again it is a plea of guilty, and so I make the same observation regarding the applicability of the standard non-parole period. The two sexual assaults inflicted on the fifteen year old girl were very serious. Compared however to the circumstances of the offences inflicted on the victim in her home in 2004, they are not as serious. They are at the lower end of the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I propose to allow in respect of sentencing for those offences a discount of twenty-five per cent on the sentence I would otherwise impose together with a modest additional discount to reflect Mr Sittczenko’s subjective features. 30 So far as accumulation and concurrency are concerned, the sentences in respect of the aggravated break enter and steal, detention for advantage and robbery committed in 2004, I propose to make concurrent with the sentences I will impose in respect of the two sexual assaults. That is because they were three serious but incidental crimes committed in the context of two crimes of far greater seriousness. They were committed on the same occasion and within a short time of each other. However, I propose to accumulate by one year the sentences which I will impose in respect of the two sexual assault offences committed by Mr Sittczenko against the victim in 2004. I propose to accumulate them by one year because they were quite separate violations of the victim. Mr Sittczenko had an opportunity to choose not to sexually assault his victim more than once. He made that choice and, so far as I am sentencing in respect of two sexual assaults, he inflicted a second sexual assault upon her. The second one was an assault involving an intercourse which lasted some ten minutes and which caused the victim significant pain. I regard it as appropriate that he serve additional time in custody for one year in respect of the criminal behaviour involved in the second offence.31 So far as the offences committed in 2006 are concerned, once again Mr Sittczenko chose to violate his victim, the fifteen year old girl, more than once. There is no evidence of how long each violation occurred, whereas with the first victim there is evidence of violations occurring over ten to fifteen minutes. The sexual assaults committed against the fifteen year old girl all occurred at the same place. Accordingly, I propose to accumulate the sentences in respect of the two sexual assaults by six months. 32 The other question of accumulation of course is between the two sets of offences. Mr Sittczenko committed sexual assaults against the first victim in 2004 and then two years later against the second victim in 2006. They were quite separate and very serious crimes. On one view there would be some justification for accumulating the sentences completely. I do not propose to do that because the result in my opinion would be a crushing sentence for a twenty-four year old young man. Nevertheless a significant degree of accumulation is required because of the quite distinct criminal behaviour perpetrated on each occasion. I propose to accumulate the sentences in respect of the 2006 offences by some three and a half years over the first series of offences committed in 2004. 33 I should add that in sentencing Mr Sittczenko in respect of the offence of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence on 13 March 2004, I take into account the offences which are listed on the list of additional charges pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act.34 Would you stand up Mr Sittczenko. I am going to sentence you now so would you take notes, I think I am right with my sums but I would like you to check these. Just so you know Mr Sittczenko I am going to sentence you to an overall sentence of imprisonment of fifteen years, the non-parole period which you have to serve from June last year will be eleven years. You will be in gaol for eleven years from 9 June 2006. 35 In respect of the aggravated sexual assault committed on 13 March 2004 at North St Marys, I fix and non-parole period of six years and six months to date from 9 June 2006 and to expire on 8 December 2012 and I fix a balance of the term as two years to commence on 9 December 2012 and to expire on 8 December 2014.36 For the second sexual assault committed on 13 March 2004, I fix a non-parole period of six years and six months to commence on 9 June 2007 and to expire on 8 December 2013. I fix a balance of the term of two years to commence on 9 December 2013 and to expire on 8 December 2015. 37 In respect of the aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence and taking into account the matters from the list of additional charges, I fix a non-parole period of three years and six months to date from 9 June 2006 and to expire on 8 December 2009 and a balance of the term of one year and six months to commence on 9 December 2009 and to expire on 8 June 2011. 38 In respect of the aggravated detaining for advantage, I fix a non-parole period of three years and six months to commence on 9 June 2006 and to expire on 8 December 2009 and I fix a balance of a term of one year and six months to commence on 9 December 2009 and to expire on 8 June 2011.39 For the aggravated robbery on the same occasion, I fix a non-parole period of three years and six months to commence on 9 June 2006 and to expire on 8 December 2009, I fix a balance of the term of one year and six months to commence on 9 December 2009 and to expire 8 June 2011.40 Turning now to the two sexual assaults committed on 20 May 2006 in Forrester Road against the fifteen year old victim, for the first sexual assault, I fix a non-parole period of five years and six months to commence on 9 June 2011 and to expire on 8 December 2016, and I fix a balance of the term of two years to commence on 9 December 2016 and to expire on 8 December 2018. 41 For the second sexual assault against the same victim on 20 May 2006, I fix a non-parole period of five years and six months to commence on 9 December 2011 and to expire on 8 June 2017 and a balance of two years to commence on 9 June 2017 and to expire on 8 June 2019. 42 So Mr Sittczenko your overall sentence is fifteen years from 9 June 2006 last year when you were arrested and it expires on 8 June 2019. Your non-parole period which you must serve also commences on 9 June 2006 and expires eleven years later on 8 June 2017. 43 Alright, we have got a mistake, I think. 44 Have a seat Mr Sittczenko. My intention is to sentence - and I will address this to Mr Sandilands and Ms Martin - Mr Sittczenko to fifteen years as a head sentence and eleven years as a non-parole period but my associate has drawn my attention to the fact that the overall sentence, the head sentence is thirteen years. I had better think about that for a moment.45 I think I had better adjourn for a moment to see if I can work it out rather than keeping everyone here. As I said my intention is to sentence Mr Sittczenko to fifteen years with a non-parole period of eleven years--SANDILANDS: And to accumulate the second set by three and a half years, is that correct?HIS HONOUR: Correct, and that is where it might be that I need to do something but rather than keep you all there. I am sorry about this Mr Sittczenko but I want to make my intention clear to you. Just let me go off the bench rather than sit here and do the calculations or at least get them right.SHORT ADJOURNMENT46 Thank you for your patience. Once again I apologise Mr Sittczenko and to counsel. The sentence in respect of the last matter that I sentenced, for which is the second aggravated sexual assault on 20 May 2006, I revoke the sentence I previously imposed, I fix a non-parole period of three years and six months to commence on 9 December 2013 and to expire on 8 June 2017 and a balance of the term of four years to commence on 9 June 2017 and to expire on 8 June 2021.47 So Mr Sittczenko the last sentence which I imposed is still the same, seven and a half years, which I fixed before but I have reduced your non-parole period from five to three years but I have started it later so it finishes at the same time and I have adjusted the balance of the term. My original intention, which has always been the case, is that the total term of your sentence is fifteen years. It commences on 9 June 2006 and expires on 8 June 2021 and the non-parole period is eleven years. It commences on 9 June 2006 and expires on 8 June 2017 and 8 June 2017 appears to be the first date upon which you will be eligible to be considered for release by the Parole Board. SANDILANDS: And your Honour has taken into account the remaining matters on the Form 1?HIS HONOUR: Say that again.SANDILANDS: And your Honour has taken into account the remaining matters of the Form 2?HIS HONOUR: On the Form 1 do you mean?SANDILANDS: Yes.HIS HONOUR: Yes I did earlier, I took that into account in sentencing Mr Sittczenko in respect of the aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence--SANDILANDS: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: --which is the offence which is noted there and I should now sign and date--SANDILANDS: Yes thank you your Honour yes that’s correct.HIS HONOUR: --this document. So exhibit B which is the Form 1 I have signed and dated.SANDILANDS: Thanks your Honour, if your Honour pleases.HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Sandilands, Ms Martin anything else that I need to do? Any orders that I need to make?SANDILANDS: Not from my point of view your Honour.CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Mr Sittczenko can be taken down.

   Judgment1. The plaintiffs by way of statement of claim seek damages for defamation for the publication by the defendant of a book “The Education of a Young Liberal” in or about July 2006. 2. The matter complained of was published after 1 January 2006. The provisions of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) (“the 2005 Act”) apply. This means that I must have regard to the fact that the imputations are particulars of the cause of action rather than the cause of action. Conformably with the practice in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, I will therefore apply the test in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125 (“the General Steel test”) and strike out imputations with extreme caution.3. The text of the matter complained of is set out as a Schedule to this judgment. It is a good example of a publication which is very much on the borderline when it comes to determining the issue of capacity of imputations.4. The imputations pleaded for each of the plaintiffs is as follows: 
     
     2(a) The first plaintiff is a prostitute. 
      
     2(b) The first plaintiff is of such low moral character that her father solicits for her. 
      
     2(c) The first plaintiff earns money from working as a prostitute. 
      
     2(d) The second plaintiff is a prostitute. 
      
     2(e) The second plaintiff is of such low moral character that her father solicits for her. 
      
     2(f) The second plaintiff earns money from working as a prostitute. 
    5. It is necessary when considering these imputations to have regard to the context of the matter complained of as well as the actual words used: Nevill v Fine Arts & General Insurance Co Ltd [1897] AC 68 at 72 per Lord Halbury LC. This is because there is a very close temporal proximity between the matter complained of and the book in which it appears, at pages 199-200. The reader would not read the matter complained of in isolation, but as part of the book in which it appears. In this sense, the publication is not unlike the matter complained of in Smyth v MacKinnon [1897] 24 R 1086, where a letter was required to be read in its context in the whole of the correspondence of which it formed a part.6. The matter complained of is entitled “The Education of a Young Liberal” but the subtitle “From private school boy to hardened political hack” makes it clear that this is a satirical tell-all book about the adventures of a wide-eyed young innocent discovering, and eventually being disillusioned by, the corrosive impact of party machine politics. This impression is confirmed by an endorsement on the dustcover from Mark Latham asserting that, horrendous though Young Liberals may be, Young Labor is worse. 7. The dustcover shows a picture of a young boy inappropriately dressed in an adult’s suit and tie. The book starts with a story about the author of the publication being unwilling to hit another student in his class, even when invited to do so by the teacher, because he is a “nice boy”. The subsequent chapters are about the adventures of the author as he travels through the landscape of party machine skulduggery, rather like a modern-day Candide. The author, in his innocence and naivety, initially is impressed by the people he meets but invariably ends up expressing his surprise or dismay at the discovery of their true nature. 8. It is against the background of this context that David Clarke, the father of the plaintiffs, is introduced to the author in a chapter entitled “Meeting with Nazis”. The purpose of the author’s “meeting with Nazis” was to obtain Right Wing support for his presidency of the Young Liberal Movement, from which position he hoped to receive pre-selection for the NSW Parliament. (He had lost the support of the Moderates, which was why he was now having discussions about what was on offer from the Right Wing).9. During the meeting the parties attempt to make a deal. Each side puts a number of bargaining chips on the table. Mr Clarke’s companion, Mr Nick Campbell, is described as “spruiking enthusiastically like a used-car salesman” (page 196). The problem was that for the author and his cohort (a Mr Kyle Kutasi) to leave their faction and join the Right Wing, they had to receive certain undertakings and assurances. The author describes himself as “pitching” for a deal and that he hoped that one stage that he had “made a sale” (page 198). However, what Mr Clarke and Mr Campbell put on offer falls short of what they wanted. All that Mr Clarke and Mr Campbell offer is that the author and Mr Kutasi join the Right Wing, without giving them the necessary assurances for the endorsement of the author as the candidate for the Young Liberal presidency. 10. The meeting concludes on the basis that the deal could not be resolved at that time. It is at this stage of the conversation that Mr Clarke began to talk “warmly about his daughters, both of whom were in the Young Liberals” (page 199). This is put on the basis that Mr Clarke appeared to have discovered that he could seem less like a fanatic and more human by talking warmly about his daughters. 11. On its face, this imputes nothing worse than a political hack trying to make himself human by emphasising family values, and certainly does not impute anything about either of his daughters. Mr Clarke then goes on to reminisce about his encounters with previous Young Liberal leaders, including one who is described on page 67 as delighting in exposing the embarrassing past of Right Wingers, adding that he has heard that the author is “not a bad performer” at Council meetings either. On this note, they part.12. As the author and Mr Kutasi leave, they review the offer put to them. The spin placed on the reference by Mr Clarke to his daughters is expressed by Mr Kutasi to be: 
     
     “ 
     ‘And did you get a load of Clarke trying to pimp off his daughters?’ he enthused, then broke into a football hooligan chant, ‘Oi, oi, oi!’ 
     ” (page 200). 
    13. The Encarta World English Dictionary defines “pimping” as “to work as a pimp, finding customers for prostitutes”. The Macquarie Dictionary defines the verb “to pimp” as “to procure; pander” and “to inform; tell tales”. 14. The defendant submits that the only sense that can be conveyed of the word “pimp” in the publication is that Mr Clarke is engaged in identifying himself as the father of the plaintiffs and is hoping to be thought of favourably. If anything, it conveys that the plaintiffs must be very likeable to be able to compensate for the apparent fanaticism of their father. It is submitted that the word “pimp” is used in a context of making the plaintiff’s father seem less fanatic and more human and it is a slang or colloquial usage in common language in Australia derived from an American slang term for being unique, “cool” or socially desirable. 15. At http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pimp#other_uses, the extract from Wikipedia provided to me by the defendant notes that “pimp” can also be used as a verb, such as “You’re pimped up!” or “Pimp my ride”. This is a reference to customizing an automobile, which is made popular by a show Pimp My Ride on MTV. To describe a car as a “pimp” or someone as a “pimp daddy” means “popular” or “cool”, originally in a derogatory way, because of the alleged fondness of pimps for wearing excessive jewellery, flashy clothes and travelling in brightly coloured vehicles with animal-print upholstery. (Upon checking the website, I note that the content of this webpage have since been updated, but the information is similar.) Eventually, as is often the way with derogatory terms, its meaning has been reclaimed to become something that is cool or socially desirable, in much the same way that the meaning of the word “ghetto” has changed. 16. Thus, in addition to the motive given by the author for Mr Clarke talking warmly about his two daughters, we have Mr Kutasi’s conflicting view of the conduct, using the word “pimping”, which he goes on to emphasis by the phrase “Oi, oi, oi!”. This phrase is defined in Wikipedia as part of a chant “Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oi, Oi, Oi” which it is claimed was first heard at the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Wikipedia quotes Professor Stephen Alomes of Deakin University as saying “the chant represents ‘enthusiasm for the tribe’ and a ‘celebration of 'us’, but at the extreme may act as a symbol of xenophobia”.17. The author of the matter complained of makes it clear in numerous references throughout his book that people who appear fairly normal at his first meeting with them turn out to be prepared to do anything, no matter how awful, to get ahead. A number of the meetings start with the author regarding someone he meets as “charming” (page 60) or “very personable” (page 62), only to find that they are comparable to Hannibal Lecter (page 62) or otherwise are “horrendous” people (to quote from the dustcover) who will do anything to get what they want. The book’s theme is to expose the dark underside of these apparently normal people.18. Having noted the impact of the context and the meanings of the slang words, I now turn to a consideration of the test to apply to the striking out of imputations under the 2005 Act.19. In exercising the discretion to strike out imputations, the court must approach its task with great caution. If it is possible that reasonable minds may differ on whether or not the matter complained of is capable of conveying a defamatory meaning, this is a strong reason for refusing the application: Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 186. In this regard, the words are not to be construed in a legal sense because the ordinary reasonable reader reads between the lines in the light of his general knowledge and experience. A wide degree of latitude will be attributed to the capacity of the ordinary reasonable member of society to draw adverse imputations where the language employed has been imprecise, ambiguous or loose, as is the case here. In particular the nature of the publication is relevant because readers of a non-sensational newspaper article may apply a greater degree of analytical focus than the reader of a sensational exposé such as this publication: John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v ACP Publishing Pty Ltd [2005] ACTCA 12.20. Ms McCallum’s submissions were persuasive and ably made. However, in the final analysis, given the context of the publication, the use of an ambiguous slang language and the miasma of innuendo that surrounds not only the matter complained of but the whole of the publication, I am of the view that while this is a borderline case, it is quintessentially a jury question whether the imputations are conveyed in this self-contradictory publication. This is not a case where the antidote so outweighs the bane that the sting of the libel cannot be said to be conveyed: John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Rivkin (2003) 77 ALJR 1657 at [26] and [50]. The Court of Appeal has emphasised the need for caution in such circumstances, most recently in Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 254.21. In the course of the argument, Mr Evatt withdrew imputations (c) and (f), and it is not necessary for me to rule on them. 22. As to costs, the defendant has had a success of sorts in that during argument the plaintiff withdrew two of the six imputations. Accordingly, I direct that the defendant pay two-thirds of the plaintiff’s costs of this application.Orders1. Note imputations 2(c) and 2(f) have been withdrawn.2. Imputations 2(a), 2(b), 2(d) and 2(e) are to go to the jury.3. Parties have leave to bring in Short Minutes of Order for a fresh timetable for the conduct of these proceedings.4. Defendant pay two-thirds of the plaintiff’s costs.

    The matter complained of 
     
     MEETING WITH NAZIS 
    The Right Wing leadership wanted it to be a CBD hotel at 9 p.m., which was fine with Kutasi and me. It had a steamy exotic atmosphere. Sitting amidst potted palm trees and white-coated waiters I felt it could easily have been somewhere like Brazil or Paraguay, perhaps one of the hotels that had played host to Nazi refugees after World War II.Heh, heh, heh… Nazis. Just like these guys. Which is not to say that they were, but I found it an amusing thought.I tried to think of a way of surreptitiously letting Kutasi know what I was thinking; failed, then decided I should really be listening to what Clarke and Campbell were saying.David Clarke and Nick Campbell – both men unknown to the public at this time – were the leaders of the Right Wing in NSW. This may sound unusual when the NSW division is home to such figures as Tony Abbott, Bill Heffernan and Bronwyn Bishop, but there it is. By now they were already twenty minutes into a spiel about how the Moderate faction was crumbling and a sea-change underway in the Party that would propel the Right Wing to lasting power. As spiels go, it sounded good without actually being convincing. It had evidently been brought to a state of near perfection through frequent use, but was rattled off for us in a perfunctory fashion like a prayer before supper. ‘Benedicto Benedicat per Jesum Christam Dominum Nostrum… The Group’s time has passed, tomorrow belongs to the Right Wing. Amen.’From what I could tell Campbell was the brains, but being only in his thirties had to make his influence felt through Clarke, who possessed the credibility. Campbell spent much of our meeting deferring to Clarke, and the rest spruiking enthusiastically like a used-car salesman. He was the Right Wing’s all-purpose ‘good bloke’, the one they wheeled out on every occasion when there were cracks to be papered over or people to be glad-handed. I had not figured out by the end of our meeting what motivated him; whether he saw factional activism as a path to personal advancement, or if he was in genuine concurrence with the views of the man sitting next to him. I got the impression that you never found out what Nick Campbell was really thinking, no matter how much time you spent with him.What Clarke himself thought was no mystery. It couldn’t be, given how volubly he broadcast his views. During my time in the Party I had received innumerable Clarke publications, all of which were basically the same: jackboot stomping about ‘militant homosexuals’, the ‘aboriginal industry’, ‘professional ethnics’, multiculturalism. Other articles of Clarke wisdom held that proposals for an Australian Bill of Rights were in some way communistic, and that the way ahead for the Liberal Party was to promulgate all its policies in accordance with the wishes of the Catholic church. Clarke was a true believer. He had been a Liberal Party member for almost forty years, and during that time had only ever bothered to stand for preselection once. For him the appeal of a parliamentary career paled beside that of dedicating every hour to the remaking of the Party in his own image. Fortunately, however, agreement with his conservative beliefs did not seem to be a sine qua non of the transaction we were discussing, and that meant I had a chance. ‘Look, gentlemen,’ I said, interrupting their carry-on, ‘I agree with a lot of what you’re saying about The Group. And Kyle and I do want to join the Right Wing. It’s just that, well, it’s hard. We both have ties to the Moderates; we have personal loyalties and relationships.’‘There are tough decisions ahead,’ Campbell suggested.‘Yes. Ah, no. Not quite. Look, we,’ – I glanced at Kyle – ‘have already made our decision. We’ll cut our ties to the Moderates, hard though that may be, and become full unqualified members of the Right, delivering you control of the Young Liberal Movement for the first time in history, if you support me for President of the movement at this year’s AGM.’Neither Clarke nor Campbell said anything, but they didn’t seem surprised.I kept pitching. ‘That will break the twenty-year Moderate lock on the Young Liberals. As you say, there’s a very good chance that you only need to win once for The Group to fall apart. I agreed with you that the only thing holding them together is self-interest and if you take power away from them, they’ll collapse. You’ll probably then control the Young Liberals ever after. But I have to be Young Liberal President. That is the bottom line.’Both men were nodding. Fantastic! Perhaps they would go for my proposal after all.‘All right,’ said Clarke, after a moment’s pause. ‘What would the ticket look like? What would your ideal team be? Your…’ he smiled, and decided to use a young person’s expression, ‘… dream team?’Campbell nodded his interest.My heart soared as I launched into further explanation, thinking I’d made a sale.That I had not became clear gradually as our conversation progressed. Clarke and Campbell wouldn’t actually commit to anything. They only wanted to talk about practicalities: how socialising us into the Right Wing would work, whether or not we wanted a job with one of the Right Wing MPs, the potential for building a proper Right Wing presence in the eastern suburbs.A much used strategy for winning over a person is getting them to focus on the practicalities of how to do something, rather than the threshold issue of whether or not they should do it in the first place. Clarke and Campbell now wielded this old tool of political persuasion skilfully. Out of the corner of my eye I could see that Kutasi was lapping it all up like an idiot. He had been rather gloomy about the prospect of doing a deal with the Right Wing; he and Clarke had had some furious arguments and confrontations over the years. But now he was nodding excitedly.This was worrisome. Clarke and Campbell had not agreed to anything, and a bit later when they stated their own bottom line, it did not inspire confidence. Yes, they would be delighted to accept us both into the Right Wing, it would be a very good fit. As for the presidency, they couldn’t see a problem – I would make an excellent Right Wing President, whether now or at some point in the future. Sadly, however, neither of them had final say on the choice of Right Wing candidate (rubbish), so Kyle and I would have to talk to our Right Wing counterparts in the movement to see what they thought.‘Will you lobby them for me?’ I asked.‘Of course,’ came the reply, ‘and maybe they’ll agree. Yes, probably they will.’ It was something that could not be resolved now. Instead Campbell suggested that we have a few more beers and talk about the big future that Kyle and I had in the Right Wing.I sighed internally, with a pretty strong premonition of what the Right Wing Young Liberals would say.The conversation that ensued wasn’t too bad. Clarke appeared to have discovered at some point in his crusade for a more conservative Liberal Party that he could seem like less of a fanatic and more human by talking warmly about his daughters, both of whom were in the Young Liberals. He reminisced about his own time as a Young Liberal. Did I know that back in those days Chris Puplick had been a conservative? Well, he had. Campbell then got into deep nostalgia mode himself and seemed to get a strange masochistic buzz out of recalling how Falinski used to rough him up at Young Liberal Council.‘And I hear that you’re not a bad performer at Council either,’ he said to me.I shrugged modestly.‘You’ll both be great assets to the Right Wing.’On the drive home Kyle was full of talk about how the meeting had gone so well, so much better than he’d expected. ‘And did you get a load of Clarke trying to pimp off his daughters?’ he enthused, then broke into a football hooligan chant, ‘Oi, oi, oi!’

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Kondasinghe Aron Sudath practised as a doctor. His public persona was that of a man of deep religious convictions, having an excellent academic record, who liked to dedicate his time, resources and professional services to underprivileged people in need; gentle, caring and pursuing with skill and compassion his medical career. He presented publicly as the devoted husband to Lakjawani Advenagi and father to their child. Once, however, the door to the family home was closed, the private persona could be very different.2 In mid-April 2005, Miss Advenagi had reached a point where she could no longer tolerate the abuse and violence she experienced from him. She was concerned their fifteen-month-old son was being affected by it. She told him she wished to separate. She had not yet done so. It was in these circumstances on 29 and 30 April 2005 the two offences - one of anal penetration of Miss Advenagi without her consent and the other of an assault upon her - occurred.3 Kondasinghe Sudath maintains he is not guilty of either offence. A jury has found otherwise. Today he must be held accountable for the criminal conduct the jury found him guilty of.4 As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for these offences before this Court committed by this offender harming this victim in this community - R v Gladue (1999) 1SCR 688 [80]. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender - subjective matters. 5 The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass, darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, whether special circumstances are to be found, totality, whether the offence attracts a standard non-parole period and, if so, the length of the parole period, and finally, of course, the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative, that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community, will also need to be determined.Facts6 On the morning of 29 April 2005, Dr Sudath had finished his last shift at the Bega Hospital. Together with his wife and son, he returned through the day to his home in Baulkham Hills. On the trip home there had been domestic tension in the car, accompanied by physical assaults upon the complainant. One of the areas of tension contributing to the violence was the question of whether the complainant had her passport or knew where it was. That issue was raised in the car. The family arrived at Baulkham Hills by 6pm or so. 7 About 9pm the complainant went to the bedroom, intending to breastfeed her son. She was lying on her bed, her son at her breast. The offender lay beside her and began making advances consistent with indicating a desire to have sex. The complainant said “No. I am breastfeeding my son. Leave me alone.” She was wearing a nightdress; he a sarong. The child began to cry. The complainant moved from the lying position. He asked, “Where’s the fucking Sorbolene?”. She left the room to look for it, thinking he may use it, as he had apparently had done so in the past, for self-pleasuring. She returned to the room and was told “Look under the bed in our room.” The son on the bed was still crying. 8 The complainant crawled on the bed towards the pillows where the boy was lying. She intended to lift the baby and take him from the room. As she made her way across the bed to the child she was pushed forward so that her backside was raised but her head and shoulders lowered towards the bedclothing. Her ankle or lower leg was grabbed. The offender lifted her nightgown and put Sorbolene in the region of her anus. She screamed “Don’t do it, don’t do it.” He inserted his erect penis into her anus. It was painful for her. She was being held and was fearful of falling towards her son. He pumped his penis into and out of her anus. She called upon him to stop. She screamed in pain. Her son had not stopped crying and was crying still, no doubt in response to his mother’s cries of distress. Her whole anal area felt ripped apart. He finished. She thinks he ejaculated. I cannot be satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt. He left the bedroom. She remained behind and breastfed her son, hoping this would soothe him. The child fell asleep. 9 She made her way to the shower and showered for half an hour. She washed away what she thought was semen weeping from her anus. When she touched her anus she also noticed blood. While I am satisfied there was a discharge that could have been semen, equally open is the possibility it was a Sorbolene discharge.10 The complainant sustained injury as a consequence of the incident. On her thighs there were a number of small bruises. On the angiogenital area there were more than a dozen linear abrasions, some two or more reaching into the anal canal. Those injuries were occasioned by the application of force to the area in the course of this sexual assault. The ones reaching into the anal canal were caused by forceful penetration of the anus. She experienced pain when she sat upon the toilet the following morning.11 The complainant has no family in Sydney. There may have been some prospects that when she separated from the accused she would return to her home country - Sri Lanka. No decision to do so had been made.12 The following morning the offender encountered the complainant on the upper landing of their two-storey dwelling. She was carrying the child. He asked her for her passport, claiming to need it for purposes of opening a bank account. She replied she did not have it. Immediately he replied, “Where’s the fucking passport?”, again to be told she did not have it. He responded, “You’re a fucking liar. Your parents are fucking liars.” He became angry. She told him she did not want to open a bank account in her name, if he wanted to open an account he could do so himself because she would not be part of that stuff any more. 13 By now he was screaming. She turned to go down the stairs. The offender grabbed her hair, banged her head up against a door frame of the upstairs study up to three times, all the time demanding her passport. She lost her footing but was able to put her son on the floor. She tried to regain her footing. The offender said, “Here is the fucking child.” and handed the child back to her. For a second time he grabbed her hair, pulling it as both made their way down the stairs. At the foot of the stairs she fell backwards, striking her bottom on one of the steps. She retained her son, clasping him in both arms. 14 Pulling on her hair the offender pulled her forward onto her feet, then pushed her towards a couch in the loungeroom. She sat holding the child. She was distressed and crying. Aron Sudath kept continuously striking her head with his fists numerous times. She was screaming. She estimates that this conduct continued for some five or more minutes. 15 She was pushed to another couch. In anger he struck her yet again in the head. She sought to defend herself by raising her hands. She called out for him to stop. At some point she stood up, only to be pushed back to the first couch and assaulted yet again. She began to scream for help, “Please hear me, please hear me.” The offender grabbed a cushion and put it on her face. The complainant struggled for breath. She stopped screaming. He released the pillow. She commenced screaming again. He replaced the cushion on her face. She lost air and stopped screaming. The cushion was removed. She screamed a third time. Three times the pillow was replaced before her will was overcome and she stopped screaming. 16 She was then told by the offender, “Feed the fucking child.” She went to the kitchen, made him formula. Once the formula was made she grabbed the child with one hand, her handbag with another and fled the house, running to a nearby neighbour’s house.17 When examined by Dr Brennan, the complainant presented with injury to the left hand. There was deep bruising to the proximal interphalangeal joints and a possible fracture of the final phalanx of the third finger. I cannot be satisfied these injuries occurred in the sexual assault. It is more likely they occurred in the assault the following day. What I am satisfied of though is that they occurred as a consequence of the activities of the offender on either 29 or 30 April. 18 However, the terms of the indicted charge are such that I cannot take these injuries, if they did occur in the assault, into account as an aggravating feature – see De Simoni v The Queen (1972) 126 CLR 576. I do, however, take into account the assault was of such ferocity that it was capable of causing injury, but I do not take into account the consequence of the assault, that is the bruising to the hand and the possible fracture.19 Once out of the house the complainant called triple O. The offender left the premises, driving away in his red Mercedes.20 At some point prior to 12 May but after the complainant had made contact with police the offender sent a long text message to her mobile telephone, 
     
      
       
      “You are the only woman I ever loved. You and baby are my life. No woman can replace you and baby. We can have a wonderful and comfortable family. Why did you destroy our family? Hope you got what you wanted. Good luck with your new man and new life. Remember no man ever loved you and baby the way I love you. Ezunuka is a God-given gift. Don’t abuse it. As horoscope says he is obsessed with his father. No-one can replace it. He will always love his father and find his father. Ezunuka and God will punish you for what you did. I don’t have to. I will always love you and miss you. Hope you are happier with your new man. I am so lonely and miserable. You can ring me any time ... I still dream of Friday night. I love you Kushmani. Don’t hesitate to ring me.” [Ezunuka I take to be a reference to the child] 
      
    21 There is nothing in the evidence, including the cross-examination, that discloses any reason for the accused to think the complainant had formed any interest in another male.22 At the time she received this text she was living at a women’s refuge with her child. I am satisfied the message was sent in circumstances where the offender knew the complainant was in contact with the police in respect of her treatment at his hands. 23 I am satisfied neither of these incidents was an isolated incident. However, while I am satisfied there had been anal intercourse with the complainant previously, I could not be satisfied it reached the violence of the one I am dealing with. Likewise, while I am satisfied there had been other forms of domestic assaults previously, I cannot be satisfied they reached the level of violence displayed in the charged offence.Objective Criminality24 I turn now to assess the objective criminality of this offence.25 From the facts as he finds them to be, a sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences before the Court as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant offences with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome.26 A useful starting point in the assessment of objective criminality in sexual assault cases is to remind the Court of part of a judgment of one of the great judges of the Supreme Court, Mr Justice Mahoney JA,  
     
      
       
      “As I have indicated, every offence of this kind is a serious offence, but those whose duty it is to deal with crimes of this kind, and to sentence those who commit them, know that though each case is inherently serious, some are more serious than others. In some cases the degree of violence, physical hurt inflicted, the form of forced intercourse and the circumstances of humiliation and otherwise are much greater than are involved [in other cases]. It is to be understood that in sentencing it is appropriate, indeed in most cases it is necessary, that the sentencing judge form and record his assessment of where on the relevant scale of seriousness the particular offence lies.” -  
      R v Gebraiel  
      (Unreported) NSW CCA 18 November 1994. 
      
    27 In 1993 the then Chief Justice made the point that non-consensual intercourse is an extreme form of violence and one which the community expects courts to take seriously (see R v Hartikainen unreported NSWCCA 8 June 1993), even if no additional violence is administered other than the intercourse -(R v Pay [1999] NSW CCA 40).28 Unwanted forced intrusion into the privacy, indeed the intimacy, of a complainant’s body and psyche against her will by the use of physical power and callous disregard of her wishes or feelings marks the essence of sexual assault offences.29 The anal penile intercourse is an offence that occurred in circumstances where the complainant had a couple of weeks earlier indicated she was seeking separation. While it is true the couple were still sharing the same bed, that bed was located near the baby’s cot. The evidence does not disclose whether they shared any intimacy in the prior two weeks. 30 The complainant had accompanied the offender to Bega whilst he was working there. I can draw no nexus for her desire to separate and the act of non-consensual intercourse. I can attribute no malice to him on that account. That must be particularly so because I would need to be satisfied of such malice beyond reasonable doubt. Nor do I draw any nexus between the events occurring in the red Mercedes on the return trip from Bega and the non-consensual intercourse. Nor can I attribute any malice following from those events in the car and the accused’s decision to engage in non-consensual intercourse.31 I am satisfied the non-consensual intercourse was about the accused’s own sexual gratification. I am satisfied the anal intercourse was selected by the accused because it offered to him greater sexual gratification. I am satisfied some part of that sexual gratification derived from the non-consensual nature of it and the additional humiliation to his victim arising from his selection of her anal passage to satisfy himself.32 The concept of non-consensual intercourse ipso facto involves an abuse of power by the strong over the weak. While it may well be at its outer extremities, e.g. the frail, the aged and the emotionally unfirm may present as vulnerable victims, I do not regard as an aggravating feature on the score of vulnerability his selection of his partner, who was seeking separation. On the other hand, the offence does constitute a very serious breach of trust by him. 33 I am conscious of Justice Sully’s remarks in R v O’Grady (Gleeson CJ and Hunt CJ at CL agreeing, see R v O'Grady (unreported) NSWCCA 13 May 1997) 
     
      
       
      “...that it must be a feature of the way in which modern personal relationships are conducted that if, for whatever reason, they break down then the woman who is involved in a relationship is entitled to feel that whatever other consequences ensue her personal safety will not be threatened at all, let alone threatened by the commission of criminal offences of the gravity of these with which we are now called upon to deal.” 
      
    34 This offender had gone through a form of marriage ceremony with the complainant. Essential to that concept was a desire by him that she would understand he would respect her person. True the ceremony could not have been a lawful marriage ceremony, but there was nothing to suggest it was an insincere exercise by him. His abuse of her person in these assaults on that basis amounts to a breach of trust aggravating the criminality of both.35 The intrusion of his penis into her anus is to be regarded as a more serious breach of intimacy of her body than some other form of penetration. It is also more degrading to his victim. The intrusion occurred not only in circumstances where she did not consent, but in the more clear circumstances where she rejected his advances. Further, she continued to reject him but he appears not to have heeded her rejections but continued with his unlawful conduct.36 The intercourse occasioned actual bodily harm in the form of pain at the time of offending and residual pain lasting some time after the event. There were the linear abrasions, seventeen in all, in the perianal region occasioned by his force. There was the bleeding. The occasioning of actual bodily harm of this kind must aggravate the criminality. While there was the use of lubricant, it would seem that was more about achieving anal penetration than minimising the complainant’s pain or discomfort.37 The offence was not an isolated incident. While that does not aggravate the criminality, it does deny to the offender the opportunity to complain it was a one-off or entirely out of character.38 The objective criminality of the assault was high. It would appear to have been sustained. It appears to have three sites - the upstairs landing, the foot of the stairs and the couch. It involved the repeated and continual use of force. It also involved the use of objects such as the door jamb and the cushion to advance the assault and the trauma. It was occasioned in domestic circumstances where there was a clear power imbalance between the attacker and his victim. 39 While I am not satisfied there is any nexus between the intended separation and the offence, I am satisfied the malice was related to the offender’s inability to find or secure his victim’s passport. His desire to do so was no doubt in the hope or expectation that he could use it as a bargaining chip on the question of if and when and how separation was to be achieved.Not Mid-range of Seriousness40 The crown seeks to argue the anal intercourse offence is one falling in what is called the midrange of seriousness. I accept that the midrange offences are offences falling within a band having borders equidistant, as it were, from a notional midpoint. The breadth of the band may well require some consideration of the maximum available penalty. 41 The offence is to be evaluated standing on its own. The fact that the offender also stands convicted of a subsequent serious assault cannot impact upon the assessment of the midrange of seriousness for the previous night’s offending.42 In evaluating whether the offence falls within the midrange, in addition to my earlier assessment it is important to recognise what it is not.  
     
     It is not part of a series of sexual offences committed against the same victim in the same incident or sequence of incidences.  
     It is not a offence against a virgin or sexually inexperienced woman or girl still tender in years, even though over sixteen. 
     The violence outside the actual sexual activity, serious as it was, did not extend beyond grabbing her ankle. There was no gratuitious violence. 
     The degrading of her, serious as it was, did not extent beyond the actual sexual activity.  
     It is not an offence that occurred in the course of some other unlawful activity such as a home invasion.  
     There was no trophy taking such as a video recording or the taking of clothing.  
     It was not achieved by threats against her or any other person with whom she had a relationship nor were there threats of retaliation in the event of disclosure. 
     This is not an offence that was planned or schemed.  
     While it may be that a decision was made to have non-consensual sex with the complainant from the moment she first said “No” when approached, I make no finding on this because I could not be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, of that proposition. The offence smacks of a more opportunistic decision made when he saw her crawling across the bed. 
     It is not an offence in which the complainant did not know the sexual history of her attacker. Thus her concerns in respect of sexually transmitted diseases were thereby minimised. 
    43 Offences falling, on their objective circumstances, within the midrange are likely to have one, or perhaps more, of those features over and above the objective criminality I have found present in the instant case before such an offence as I am dealing with would fall within the midrange.44 Of course, should an offence such as I am dealing with have substantially more such features or the gravity of the features I have found themselves be greater, then a grading above the midrange would be appropriate. 45 As I assess the objective features, taking into account the aggravating features I have found, this offence falls below a midrange of seriousness, it escapes such a classification by a small margin.46 I reject the defence submission that the offending falls towards the lower end of the range of seriousness for s 61I offending.Victim Impact Statement47 I have received a victim impact statement. The material contained in the victim impact statement is not sworn evidence and has not been subject to cross-examination. To the extent that any opinions are expressed in the statement I recognise they are not the opinions of a qualified expert.48 The victim impact statement coming, as it does, from the primary victim may, if I accept it as reliable, provide unsworn evidence as to the facts of the offences and their effect upon her.49 The function of statements such as this one is firstly to give to the victims an opportunity of being heard in sentencing proceedings by publicly identifying the trauma of impact visited upon them by the acts of an offender.50 Secondly they enable the sentencing proceedings to assist victims as they move towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the criminal conduct of an offender.51 Thirdly the victim impact statement contributes to an offender at least hearing first hand and perhaps gaining insight into the impact his offending conduct had upon his victim.52 Finally, the victim impact statement ensures that a court has a continuing consciousness of the impact violent crime has upon those ordinary men and women who are its victims. As such a victim impact statement plays a very important part in the administration of criminal justice.53 The relevant portions of this victim impact statement, which I accept do not entirely comply with the provisions of the Act, are these:  
     
      
       
      “My name is xxxx Advenagi. My date of birth is xx xxx 1976. This is my victim impact statement.  
      
     
     
      
      It has been very difficult for me to write this as it reminds me of things that I would rather forget...After [the offender] sexually assaulted me and then assaulted me the following morning I knew I had to escape from him. I feared for my safety, I could not stay.  
      
     
     
      
      I stayed in a refuge for eight months and this put a large strain on my relationship with my parents and extended family. I did not have control over my own finances when I was living with him... 
      
     
     
      
      The violence and sexual abuse by Aron has had a profound effect on my abilities as a functioning member of society. I feel as though he has ruined my life.  
      
     
     
      
      I have been receiving counselling over the last two years to help me overcome the effect of these offences. I have problems sleeping, I have nightmares and an overwhelming sense of anxiety about life in general. I have difficulties concentrating on my studies. I have also discussed with my counsellor my fear of being around men and intimacy... 
      
     
     
      
      I am still fearful of Aron and will never really feel safe from him again. I do not feel safe in my day to day living. I do not feel any safer knowing there are AVOs and bail conditions that he is not to contact me. I avoid going to Parramatta as I do not want to relive the fear I felt when I was there for his trial. I have tried to change everything about my life to avoid being reminded of him in any way.  
      
     
     
      
      I have suffered physical injuries with fractures, cuts and bruises. I still feel degraded and humiliated when I think of the medical examination and photographs of my injuries. I feel embarrassed that they had to be shown to the jury but I realised it was important that they knew what happened... 
       
       
      I wonder what I will tell our son about his father. Will I tell him about the crimes his father has committed, will I tell him what happened to me, how will I deal with it. How can I take that shame away from my son?  
      
     
     
      
      I now have difficulties trusting my own judgment again after this. I feel my life will never be the same.” 
      
    54 It would appear that the victim had little legal assistance preparing that statement and I have read out and taken into account the impact only of the offending conduct I am dealing with.Subjective Features55 I turn now to the subjective features. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence but I am also sentencing this offender for it.56 Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of these offences by this offender or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate.57 Aron Sudath was born in Colombo, Sri Lanka in September of 1967. He was forty years of age this week. He had a comfortable life within an established family in Colombo. He is the youngest of three bothers and one sister. His family are all high achievers.58 He has been married. He claims he commenced a defacto relationship with the complainant in 2003. She however has been living in his home since 1999. He claims he was not in a relationship with her then. 59 It would seem that he either felt a need for, or sought the approval of his family to enter into a relationship with her. The evidence before me suggests inter-family inquiries on the part of both families to assure each family the other one was of sufficient standing for the relationship to be approved. After mutual approval was obtained a culturally appropriate wedding ceremony was performed in the Blue Mountains. 60 Unfortunately Sudath had been previously married but not divorced. In that sense the ceremony was a fraud and profoundly disrespectful to the complainant. As I said earlier it does not mean that he did not otherwise approached it sincerely. The human psyche is capable of entertaining more than one emotion at a time. I have no reason to doubt the ceremony was entered into by Sudath as a sincere commitment by him to the complainant.61 Aron Sudath was academically astute. He was the dux of his school, he was a leader and sportsman at the school. He attended university in Adelaide, qualified in medicine receiving a high distinction in some, if not all, of his subjects. He was involved in research and practiced medicine in remote areas serving Aborigines as a general practitioner and surgeon. He also worked in New Zealand for nine months.General Health62 The offender is reported to suffer from stress related angina which is said to have commenced in 2002. He also suffers hypertension, cholesterol, both of which are controlled by medication. These are matters he was able to cope with during his busy practice.63 Justice Health will be responsible for oversighting the offender’s health needs and should take note of these problems. In addition to this criminal matter are other stresses to be found in the Family Court proceedings and in his potential for deportation.64 He also experiences lower back pain which he manages with anti-inflammatories.Mental Health65 The offender appears to have been battling reactive depression since 2002. He claims the depression related to the complainant who he says was also suffering depression. Another contributor may have been overwork. The depression has increased since being charged in 2005 and yet again after the jury verdict. He is on a maximum dose of Zoloft, an antidepressant and the sedative Temazepam.66 He appears, at least when he was on bail, to be supplementing those medications with at least a bottle of wine daily which I would have thought would be contra-indicated against the medications of depression.67 There is material which suggests that his wine consumption, prior to his bail being revoked, could be as much as two litres daily.Character and Criminal History68 There is little doubt the offender’s public persona has been one of dedicated service to the public through his profession, strong commitment to his Buddhist faith. His older brother writes:  
     
      
       
      “Aron was always keen on community-based work, charity work, humanitarian work. Consequently he spent quite a lot of his time working for underprivileged rural Australia and for Aboriginal communities. Whenever he goes to Sri Lanka he treats a large number of poor and needy people free of charge as a service.” 
      
    His sister writes: 
     
      
      “Aron loved serving underprivileged and disadvantaged communities as a doctor. Since medical school his heart was set to serve rural Australians, Aborigines and Royal Flying Doctor Service in Australia. Outside Australia he wanted to serve poor and needy in third world countries consequently he spent a lot of time working for rural Australians/Aborigines. 
       
       
      Whenever he travelled to Sri Lanka and India he conducted many clinics free of charge and donated medicines brought from Australia. He loved charity and is a very generous man. He visited tsunami affected regions and donated a house to victims. He has provided a number of scholarships to struggling students in rural Sri Lanka.” 
      
    His present partner writes of him being a caring gentle lover. Other of his references speak of the offence as being out of character. It is clear, from the oral evidence led on sentence and testimonials tendered in evidence, that there is a wide network of support and admiration for Aron Sudath.69 There is in 1998 a discharge with a $375 fine for the commission of a common assault that occurred in September of 1997. There are no other convictions recorded in New South Wales.70 But for this minor blemish of physical violence ten years ago he is otherwise legally of good character consequently he is entitled to considerations of leniency on that account.Attitude to offence71 He maintains his innocence. Some insight into his attitude to the offence can be gleamed from his post-trial attitude to the complainant. He told Anita Duffy that in Sri Lankan culture marrying a doctor was “a big prize for a young girl”. He gave a history to Dr Allnutt that he was unable to engage with the Sri Lankan community “because of his wife’s family poor reputation within the community”.72 In the text message that I referred to he made reference to his “not having to punish her” and a derisory reference to her being happy with another man.73 He told John Taylor that he never married the complaint “because of his ongoing concerns about her background”.74 These statements appear to indicate, as I say, a lack of respect for her. In the light of the jury’s verdicts these remarks would have to be assessed as a continuing lack of respect for her. 75 On the other hand a certificate of participation showing completion of three courses offered by the Domestic Violence and Incest Resource Centre has been tendered. The courses were completed in the community as distinct from within the prison. They relate to domestic violence, recognising it, managing professional development in responding to it and providing crisis intervention and support for those experiencing it. 76 On one view the courses may be seen as part of the continuing education and professional development of a GP. On another view the courses may be viewed as a step towards managing his personal, as distinct from professional, development in a way in which he did not lose face within his community to focus on domestic violence. I am prepared to accept it as the latter.77 An overview of his attitude to this offence is an absence of contrition, a continuing disrespect to the complainant and an absence of any real insight into the antisocial nature and the violence involved in his behaviour.Rehabilitation Prospects78 There appear to be a number of positive rehabilitation factors: 
     
     Good family support and a wide social network also supportive. 
     Intelligent, well-qualified man. While it is unlikely he will practice medicine again, he has skills and capacity as a researcher. He is likely to find employment opportunities given his qualifications and skill base.  
     But for an assault ten years ago there is nothing of violence on his record. 
     He is experiencing reactive depression which hopefully will be amenable to treatment and improved circumstances upon release. 
     While his attitude to the complainant appears to be one where he is lacking in respect, it does not appear that he generally lacks respect for women. His present partner seems to feel he is respectful of her. 
    An Overview of Subjective Matters79 Apart from a lack of contrition for and insight into his offending conduct his subjective features are otherwise strong mitigating features upon the sentencing discretion. An overview of the subjective features are not such that they would tip this matter into a midrange of seriousness. I have paused to consider whether the material I reviewed on the offender’s attitude to the offence should do so. On my view of the evidence that material is not such as to suggest an increase to the seriousness of the offence itself. True it may adversely impact upon the sentencing discretion but those matters do not drive upwards the objective seriousness of the offence (see s 54A(2) Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. These are all ex post facto conditions (see R v AGP [2004] NSW CCA 434at [13] per Simpson J, Adams and Howie JJ agreeing).Delay80 The jury verdict was delivered in March of 2007. It is now six months later. It is regrettable the matter has taken so long to finalise. For those six months the offender could have been in no doubt that he would be incarcerated. However, the factors of delay ought be analysed. The offender changed his legal representation. Finding suitable dates in a busy court calendar and for equally busy practitioners is always difficulty. 81 While I appreciate the impact of having the prospect of uncertain imprisonment time hanging over one's head for such a lengthy period, the delay that I have before me cannot mitigate the sentence otherwise appropriate. The matter was set down for hearings on sentence shortly after trial. Delays have been either of the offender’s own making or because of busy court and legal professional activities.Special Circumstances84 This is an appropriate case in which to find special circumstances. The offender will be entering prison at forty for his first sentence. He has good prospects of rehabilitation. As a Sri Lankan he is likely to be culturally isolated in New South Wales prison. Given his prior status as a doctor he may well be a target for standover merchants. He is likely to find prison more arduous than most.85 He told Robert Kerr, psychologist he was suffering an extreme reaction to people that conformed to his stereotypes of people who he might encounter in gaol.Guideline Judgments86 Way’s case is a seminal case regarding the sentencing of offenders charged with offences that may carrying a standard non-parole period. Even when, as in this case, the sentencing judge determines the case is one that does not demand or require the standard non-parole period, he or she is still required to respond to the legislature’s intention that such offences are to attract greater severity of sentencing outcomes than was previously the case.87 The sentence I have framed is one that is intended to reflect this principle. On the other hand the subjective features, as I have earlier remarked, have a mitigating impact upon the sentence particularly in the selection of a non-parole period I have settled upon.Deterrence88 Both offences were domestic violence offences. They were committed within a domestic relationship. In sentencing a domestic violence offender specific and general deterrence are important factors to be taken into account in sentencing (see R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302). Custody89 The offender has been on bail since charged but for a week. He was incarcerated last week when his bail was revoked. Formal Orders90 Kondasinghe Aron Sudath I convict you of the offence that you, on 30 April 2005 at Baulkham Hills in the State of New South Wales did assault Lakjawani Anne Advenagi. 91 I sentence you to a non-parole period for this offence of six months to date from 14 September 2007 and to expire on 13 March 2008. I set a balance of term for this offence of nine months to expire on 13 December 2008.92 Kondasinghe Aron Sudath I also convict you that you on 29 April 2005 at Baulkham Hills had sexual intercourse with Lakjawani Anne Advenagi without her consent knowing she was not consenting. 93 I sentence you to a non-parole period of three years to commence on 14 March 2008 and to expire on 13 March 2011. I set a balance of term of two years to expire on 13 March 2013. 94 The question of whether you will be released to parole or not is not a question for me, it is a question for the Parole Board and that will depend upon what progress you make whilst you are in custody. Yes the offender may be returned to his custody.

      JUDGMENT  
       
      
    1 Her Honour: Both Defendants are charged separately with an offence under s 125 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (the EP&A Act) in that between approximately 1 July 2006 and 8 August 2006 the Defendants caused trees at Lot 186 DP754405 Herons Creek Road, Herons Creek NSW (the property) to which the Hastings Tree Preservation Order 2003 (the TPO) applied to be destroyed contrary to the provisions of cl 20 of the Hastings Local Environmental Plan 2001 (the LEP).  
     
      
    2 The particulars specified in both summonses are: 
     
      
       
        
        The Defendant caused the destruction through the use of a bulldozer of at least 1000 trees spread over a 28 hectare area of the Property without development consent or the permission of Port Macquarie-Hastings Council.  
        
       
      
    3 The person who bulldozed the trees the subject of the charge, Mr Lindsay, was not charged and gave evidence in the Prosecutor’s case. Lawlor Services Pty Ltd was the owner of the property at the time the offence was committed. It is alleged to be guilty because Mr Petro, who is also charged, was the “heart, mind and will” of Lawlor Services Pty Ltd when the offence was committed. The legal basis of the charge against Mr Petro is that he engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Lindsay to cut down trees over 3m in height which is in breach of the TPO. Both Defendants have pleaded not guilty. 
     
      
       
      Relevant legislation 
      
    4 Section 125(1) of the EP&A Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        Where any matter or thing is by or under this Act, other than by or under the regulations, directed or forbidden to be done, or where the Minister, the Director-General, a council or any other person is authorised by or under this Act, other than by or under the regulations, to direct any matter or thing to be done, or to forbid any matter or thing to be done, and that matter or thing if so directed to be done remains undone, or if so forbidden to be done is done, a person offending against that direction or prohibition shall be guilty of an offence against this Act.  
         
        
       
      
    5 The Prosecutor is taking action under cl 20(4) of the LEP which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        A person must not ringbark, cut down, top, lop, remove or wilfully destroy a tree to which a tree preservation order applies without development consent or the permission of the Council or unless authorised to do so by or under an Act. 
        
       
       
      Summary of evidence  
      
    6 In brief, the Prosecutor relied on the written evidence of Council officers Mr Owens and Mr Rock. Part of two affidavits of Ms Davine, Council officer, were relied on and she also gave extensive oral evidence. Part of an affidavit of Council officer Mr Hanlon was relied on and he also gave extensive oral evidence. Various documents exhibited to the Council officer’s affidavits were also tendered in evidence. The bulldozer driver, Mr Lindsay, gave extensive oral evidence. The captain of the local rural fire service Mr Hagney, and logging contractors Mr Lewis, Mr Toms and Mr Bartlett gave oral evidence. The Defendants relied on the oral evidence of Mr Parish, the previous owner of the property. Additional documents such as the contract for the sale of land to Lawlor Services Pty Ltd, one of the Defendants, were also relied on. 
     
      
    7 According to the affidavit of Mr Owens, Planning Manager of the Council, sworn 4 September 2006, Lot 186 is owned by Lawlor Services Pty Ltd and is 53.9ha. It is wholly contained in the Port Macquarie-Hastings Local Government Area. The 23ha northern portion of the property is zoned 4(a) Industrial under the LEP. This is the area of the property the subject of these charges.  
     
      
    8 Lot 186 is bounded by the North Coast Railway to the east and Herons Creek Road to the west, as depicted on Exhibit A. The dividing line between the southern portion of rural zoned land and the industrial zoned land is a notional line across the property which follows the direction of Logans Crossing Road. The evidence on the property boundaries is clear although I note there are discrepancies regarding the area of the industrial land as identified in the summons (28ha), the affidavit of Mr Rock (23ha) and an affidavit of Ms Davine (30ha). I do not think those discrepancies in the evidence are material. 
     
      
    A. Evidence concerning tree removal the subject of the charges9 There is extensive evidence concerning the events leading up to the tree removal and the tree removal the subject of these charges. 
     
      
      Mr Parish 
      
    10 The Court heard oral evidence from Mr Parish that as he was selling the property to Lawlor Services Pty Ltd he wished to have logged and sold the “loggable” timber on the property. This was included as a special condition of the sale. The contract for sale of the property to Lawlor Services Pty Ltd is in evidence and was dated 17 February 2006. The transfer took place in March 2006. Mr Parish had applied for the Harvest Management Plan (the HMP) from the Council after the logging contracting company, Heron’s Creek Timber Company, suggested that he do this. The application is dated 19 July 2005. He had not previously applied for a HMP for logging on the property and was not aware that he needed approval. Further evidence from Mr Parish concerning the arrangements made as part of the sale of the property whereby he did not undertake any post logging clean up is set out at par 96.Logging contractors: Lewis, Toms, Bartlett 
     
      
      Mr Lewis 
      
    11 Mr Lewis gave evidence that three men were involved in the logging, himself and another, Robert Toms, cutting the timber and a third person taking the timber away. They started logging on 9 March 2006 and continued for six weeks to two months. Mr Lewis selected the trees to be logged and cut them down and Mr Toms operated the machine called a skidder.12 Logging commenced ""right up on the southern point of the private property"", as far south as the railway line where there was a powerline running through. A railway line also formed the eastern boundary of the area logged. To the north, the loggers worked as far as the old homestead on the private property. They logged both to the north and south of Logans Crossing Road. They could not find much millable timber towards the southern end of the powerline, between the powerline and the road that is the boundary of the property to the south. 
     
      
      Mr Bartlett 
      
    13 Mr Bartlett gave evidence that he was in charge of the logging operation. He thought that logging started around 3 March 2006 and continued for about six weeks. He went on to the site about three or four times, while two workers were there at all times. He stated that logging went as far north as about half a kilometre below the Boral mill at Herons Creek and to the south, they logged about a kilometre along the road to where the property ends and the road and the railway line make a “V”. Mr Bartlett thought this road was probably Logans Crossing Road, and stated that it runs directly north to south on the edge of the property.14 Mr Bartlett was shown a document from Duncan's Holdings, a company connected to Boral Timber (which received the timber) listing delivery docket numbers and intake dates for log loads and woodchips from the Parish property (exhibit U). Based on that document Mr Bartlett stated that the first load of logs from the property was delivered to Boral on 13 March 2006 and the last on 3 May 2006. In cross-examination, Mr Bartlett was shown an invoice issued to Boral Timber by Bundook Pty Ltd (Mr Bartlett’s company) which set out the date of work, the type of service and the fee, inter alia (exhibit V). Mr Bartlett agreed that this document showed that work was invoiced on 25 May 2006. This indicated that 25 May 2006 could have been the last date of logging on the property, but he could not be sure because the document did not say ""Parish"" to identify where the timber came from. In re-examination he stated he had no logging work in the period up to 25 May 2006 other than the logging on the Parish property. 
     
      
      Mr Toms 
      
    15 Mr Toms stated that he is involved in the timber industry and drives a skidder. He stated that logging commenced on the property on about 9 March 2006 and continued for about six weeks. Mr Lewis would fell the tree, while his work involved driving up to the log to pick it up and driving back out. He stated that he knocked over some timber doing this.16 The logging at the property started at the south end of the block, just north of the powerline. The loggers worked from the south to the north. The property that was logged was the land between the railway line which runs north to south and a road that runs in the same direction. At the southernmost point of that property, there is a viaduct for the road over the railway line. Mr Toms thought that road was called Herons Creek Road. That road was at the end of Logans Crossing Road, about 1.5 km from the Boral Mill. The northernmost point of the logging was the old cottage, the westernmost point was the road and the easternmost point was the railway line. 17 In cross-examination, Mr Toms was shown a statement he had prepared in conjunction with the Council. He agreed that the area logged was in the industrial zone to the north of Logans Crossing Road. Mr Toms stated that they also logged the area beyond that to the south, although this was not stated in the document or his affidavit. He stated that they logged just beyond the power lines in the southern part of the property. He agreed that he had not told the Council that he had logged south of Logans Crossing Road. 
     
      
      Mr Hagney 
      
    18 Mr Hagney, captain of the local rural fire service, gave oral evidence that on 10 July 2006 he attended the site with Mr Eddie Petro. Mr Petro asked Mr Hagney to view the site “in relation to reducing any hazard that might be there, any fire hazard that might be there”. He stated “Mr Petro asked me was the fire brigade would be interested in reducing the fire hazard by burning”. Mr Hagney replied that “ we could be interested after any necessary approvals were obtained”. Mr Hagney suggested that if approvals were given “they wouldn’t burn as they were on the ground, they would have to be pushed up into manageable heaps before they could be burnt”. 
     
      
      Mr Lindsay 
      
    19 Mr Lindsay, the bulldozer driver, gave oral evidence for the Prosecutor that Mr Bill Armitage contacted him about doing some work on the property. On 13 July 2006, he met with Mr Armitage on the property. Mr. Lindsay had done work for Mr Armitage for quite a few years. Mr Armitage rang Mr. Petro while Mr. Lindsay was present. Mr Armitage said “they wanted it tidied up before they burnt it”. Mr Armitage told Mr. Lindsay to “tidy up the site for the firies”. Mr Lindsay sent the bill for the work to Mr Armitage after the work was done. 
     
      
    20 Mr. Lindsay began work on the site on 18 July 2006. He met Mr Petro for the first time at the property on the day he started work. Mr Petro came to the site for about 15-30 minutes every day he worked. He continued with the work until he was asked to stop work by Ms Davine on the property on 8 August 2006. At that stage the work was nearly complete, requiring only another couple of hours work to be done. He estimates that the work took about 101.5 hours, done over about 12 or 13 days. He worked continuously, not stopping for lunch. He would stop when he noticed Mr Petro. He did all the cleaning up work on the property other than three acres which was done by someone else.  
     
      
    21 Mr Lindsay stated that he was asked to tidy up the heaps of debris and reduce the fire hazard. While the Prosecutor asked him whether he recalled telling Ms Davine that he thought that he would tidy up the heaps, get rid of fire hazard and remove everything other than large trees and he said yes, he qualified the last part of his answer in the next answer in which he referred to “all the spindly oaks”. Parts of the conversation with Ms Davine are set out at par 34. He did not say to her “and remove everything other than the larger trees”. He had done this kind of work for 40 years and he decided where the piles/windrows would go and what trees were pushed over. His job was debris management and he had done a lot of work preparing for burn offs by the fire service. He did not get specific instructions from anyone about what a large tree was. He knew because of his experience that it was trees 10m or 12m or more. He used a bulldozer with a 13 foot blade with a 14 foot rake attached. He was able to manoeuvre accurately with the blade on the front of the bulldozer. He avoided knocking over large trees in doing the work. He stated that because of his experience, he could recognise a damaged tree. He agreed that he was able to recognise the tree of about 3m when he saw one. When asked by the Prosecutor ""you're not just going in there willy-nilly trying to push down trees?"" Mr Lindsay replied ""No, no"". He agreed with the Prosecutor that he exercises care in this work and tries to do as little damage as possible. He stated ""you don't just go in and bluster everything down. You leave all the trees that you can leave and then just that one that’s really damaged, you think he won't survive, you know, so you take him over"". 22 He pushed the heads of the trees cut down and left by the loggers into windrows. He accepted that there were 142 of these windrows. The heads were left in a mess by the loggers and he would push some together to create the windrows. The heads had fallen amongst other trees, some of which were big trees 5m to 10m and some of which were smaller spindly trees and some of these were more than 3m in height. When the head was amongst large trees, many times he would hook the rippers on the back of the bulldozer and pull it out so as not to damage the larger trees which are taller than 8 to 10 metres. That process would knock over some of the smaller spindly trees some of which were more than 3m. If the head was not amongst larger trees but smaller trees, he would push the head out of where it was which would also knock down the odd spindly oak more than 3m in height. Many of the spindly oaks were not more than 3m because they had fire through them every now and again which kills them. As there were tracks made by the loggers everywhere the heads were easy to get to and he did not have to clear many trees to get to them. 
     
      
    23 Trees that were badly damaged by other trees felled by the loggers were also knocked down. These generally had trunk diameters of 8 inches and were about 4m – 4.5m in height. These were trees with several limbs knocked off or that were completely broken off by a falling tree. Mr Lindsay estimated there were about 150 eight-inch trees damaged which he pushed over because he considered they were dangerous or unlikely to survive. There were a few in a large number of the windrows but not in every windrow. Mr Lindsay stated that he could push over trees of about 8 inches in diameter with the rake, but not bigger trees. He could only manoeuvre the rake a limited distance above the ground. To push over bigger trees, he stated that ""a tree pusher"" would be needed. When he pushed over the larger damaged trees which had smaller spindly oaks around the base of the tree some of these were also pushed over. The odd one of these was more than 3m in height. 
     
      
    24 He estimated there were a couple of 3m or more spindly oaks pushed over for each of the heads that he pushed up into a windrow, with about three to four heads per windrow. He did not agree with the Prosecutor that he undertook parkland clearing, rather he considered he was tidying up after logging. 
     
      
    25 In cross-examination he said he could not be sure how many spindly oaks in excess of 3m he knocked over. He stated that he knocked over the odd one. There could have been five to eight spindly oaks over 3m in some windrows. Knocking them over was unavoidable as they were growing where the heads were. 26 The state of the property when he commenced work was that it was a “mess”. There were a large number of tree heads lying around and several log dumps, which were devastated, meaning completely cleared of vegetation including ends of logs. The log dumps were about 50m by 75m in area. There were about six or eight of these. Snig tracks used to bring the logs to the log dumps radiated out from these. Vegetation on these tracks was pushed over by the logging crews vehicles. The felled logs when connected to the skidder also smash everything in their path and knock vegetation over if pulled sideways. Vegetation was cleared 1m either side along the snig tracks. The snig tracks were estimated to be up to 150m long and about 6m wide. There were 25 to 30 tracks from each log dump and some of these would be connected by other tracks. He tried to use the snig tracks and the tracks connecting these to avoid knocking over any trees. Part of the work included tidying up the debris about 1m either side of the track. Spindly oaks had grown through that material and were knocked down. The odd spindly oak more than 3m in height would have been knocked down. 
     
      
    27 In relation to the state of the property when he arrived to commence work, Mr Lindsay said in cross-examination: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. And then you’ve told us about the damaged trees that you observed where they’d been broken off? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. Were many of those broken trees in the vicinity of tree stumps that you’d seen had been sawed off? 
         
        A. Yeah, yeah, they were in the vicinity of that, yeah, where the logging carried out, yeah. 
         
         
        Q. And when you observed what was out on site there were also, were there not, trees that in fact had their heads taken off but had just been left there? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. Which would suggest to you that they’d been left there because the loggers didn’t think there was commercial value in taking those particular logs? 
         
        A. Yeah, yeah, the ones that were broken off, yeah. 
         
         
        Q. Yes, I see, so the ones that they had felled but had got broken in the felling they left behind? 
         
        A. No, the log parts didn’t break, the overheads bust up, not the log part. 
         
         
        Q. And then there was also when you were on site you saw some of the slim forest oaks that you’ve described, spindly, you saw the spindly forest oaks? 
         
        A. Yeah, yeah. 
         
         
        Q. Some of those had been knocked over during the course of the logging? 
         
        A. Yeah, they just drive over them, yeah. 
         
         
        Q. Some of them had been pushed aside by the size of the snigging tracks? 
         
        A. Yeah, yep, only beside the snigging tracks but they just drive over the others. 
         
         
        Q. Yes and what you observed there when you got out on site was what you described I think as a complete mess? 
         
        A. Yeah, it was a mess. 
         
         
        Q. And it was typical of a pace  
        [sic] 
         logging property? 
         
        A. Yeah, I’ve worked on before, yeah. 
         
         
        Q. With trees just smashed everywhere? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
        
       
      Prosecutor on Lindsay 
      
    28 The Prosecutor submitted on the oral evidence of Mr Lindsay that evidence about the number of trees removed is not entirely clear. However, it is apparent that trees (to which the TPO apply) were removed by him carrying out each of the following components of his work:(a) pushing up of tree heads where they had fallen amongst trees;(b) getting into an area to push up the heads:(c) cleaning up along the snig tracks:(d) pushing over damaged trees:(e) dragging out a tree head29 During cross-examination by the Defendants’ counsel Mr Lindsay estimated there might be more than five and up to eight spindly oaks over 3m in some windrows. In addition to pushing over the smaller trees, Mr Lindsay also pushed over about 150 “damaged” trees of about 8 inches in diameter. The precise number is difficult to ascertain but Mr Lindsay estimated there were probably four or five or half a dozen (damaged) trees in each pile. These were about 4m high. Mr Lindsay pushed over these trees as they were broken off and “ruined”. Some had limbs broken off by the falling trees during the logging, some were completely broken off on the trunk and some had bark ripped off. Mr Lindsay pushed over trees like this when he found them. Mr Lindsay also stated that there were about three or four stumps of 3 m or more in each pile. 
     
      
      Defendants on Lindsay 
      
    30 The Defendants relied on the state of the property as identified by Mr Lindsay as including about six log dumps; each log dump would involve the cleaning up of all vegetation in an area somewhere between 50m x 50m to 75m x 75m; there were snig tracks at least 6m wide and about 150m long and there were 25 to 30 snig tracks radiating out from the log dump. According to the Defendants each log dump required clearing of approximately 2.5ha and the snig tracks were 6m x 150m x 25m, a total of 22,500m2 of cleared area when Mr Lindsay arrived on the property. 
     
      
    31 The main reason spindly oaks were removed was because they had grown through the debris which had to be moved by Mr Lindsay. Most of the spindly oaks were “flat out” being 3m, according to Mr Lindsay. He could tell what size they were because his bulldozer was about 3m high. Mr Lindsay knew from experience what the fire brigade wanted and he decided where the piles of vegetation would be located. He was responsible for the debris management. 
     
      
    32 His evidence was that few of the “spindly oaks” were in excess of 3m in height, relying on his statements that you would get “the odd one” over 3m. Fire went through the property regularly and destroyed them, as was confirmed by the evidence of Mr Parish (see par 112 -115). 
     
      
    Ms Davine33 In her affidavit dated 20 September 2006 Ms Davine stated that her duties include the investigation of alleged breaches of the EP&A Act and breaches of the TPO. Her duties also include the assessment of timber harvesting applications on properties covered by the Council’s TPO. At par 4 of her affidavit worn 20 September 2006 Ms Davine stated: 
     
      
       
        
        I say that prior to 3 August 2006, I was already familiar with the Property as a consequence of my work duties in assessing timber harvesting applications. The Property comprises a 53 hectare portion of land, with the northern 30 hectare portion zoned 4(a) Industrial and the southern 23 hectare portion zoned 1(a1) Rural. Annexed and marked “A” is a map which provides an aerial overview of the property. On that map the area that is owned by Lawlor Services Pty Limited is identified by a red boundary. I was aware that prior to a transfer of ownership in March 2006, the Parish family had owned the Property for over 100 years with a long history of it as a timber farm. In 1988, the northern portion of the land was rezoned to 4(a) Industrial but it had continued to be used for timber farming. 
         
        
       
      
    34 Ms Davine stated that she attended the property on 8 August 2006, when she had a conversation with Mr Lindsay and took photographs. The conversation as set out in her affidavit dated 20 September 2006 included parts as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. What were you asked to do here? 
         
        A. Just do what I’m doing now, just tidy up the underscrub and that … 
         
        A. About three weeks ago I came and had a look at the job with Billy the property had been logged and the heads were all just left and they just wanted it tidied up. 
         
        Q. Are you doing logging as well? 
         
        A. No, I’m cleaning up the mess, the heads and that. 
         
        Q. In those piles of vegetation there is a lot more than just the heads from the logging, there are also a lot of forest oaks and other trees over 3m in height. 
         
        A. Yeah, I was just cleaning up and pushing up all the heads, a few trees probably got knocked down … 
        
       
      
    35 She attended the property on 9 August 2006 with Mr Hanlon and Mr Owens, when she took photographs. Those photographs were attached to her affidavit sworn 13 October 2006 and became Exhibit N. She attended again on 13 September 2006 with other Council officers, including Mr Hanlon, as part of the Council’s continuing investigations when vegetation in randomly selected windrows was identified and counted.  
     
      
    36 Ms Davine gave oral evidence that she attended the property in May 2006 to inspect it after the logging pursuant to the HMP had been finished. She considered about 1,000 trees had been removed between her inspection in May 2006 of Lot 186 after the logging by the logging contractors pursuant to the HMP had stopped, and when she went to the site on 8 August 2006 following a complaint about tree clearing. On that day she spoke to Mr Lindsay and told him to stop work. The statement that 1,000 trees had been removed was allowed into evidence under s 78 of the Evidence Act 1995 over the objection of the Defendants. 
     
      
    37 In the voir dire held to establish whether her opinion had a rational basis (I held that it did) her evidence was that this statement of 1,000 trees was based on the number of windrows (piles) of vegetation (142) and an approximation of the number of trees (10) in each windrow. She considered “trees” meant trees in addition to the heads of trees from logs, pushed down subsequent to the logging. She considered her estimate was conservative. She described what she saw on the property in August 2006 as parkland clearing. 
     
      
    38 Ms Davine also gave oral evidence about the photographs taken of the site by her, annexed to her affidavit of 13 October 2006, which became exhibit N. She explained that some were taken in northern portion of the property on the industrial land. She stated that the some of the photos showed windrows with partly green vegetation in them. 
     
      
     
     
      
      Defendants on Davine evidence 
      
    39 Ms Davine’s evidence was criticised by the Defendants on several bases. It was impressionistic because it was not based on any specific tree count of trees more than 3m in height done before the work undertaken by Mr Lindsay, or afterwards, in any comprehensive way. Nor did her estimates of trees knocked down distinguish between trees on the ground left as a result of the logging process and those knocked over by Mr Lindsay. I should infer that the failure to ask her about the height of the trees she had observed in May and the height of the trees missing in August was that had she been asked such a question her answer would not have assisted the Prosecutor’s case, see Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 389 at 418 – 419. The Court should not infer, as the Prosecutor suggested, that her evidence would have been favourable to the Prosecutor’s case. Her estimate of 1,000 trees does not state how tall the trees were. Her estimate is based on measurements taken by other Council officers of trees in a few of the windrows, and she was only the scribe on the day, writing down what they told her. She did not form her own opinion of the length of any trees in the windrows. 
     
      
      Mr Hanlon 
      
    40 Mr Hanlon, the Council’s Tree Assessment Officer, provided an affidavit sworn 18 October 2006, part of which was read, and also gave oral evidence. His duties include the assessment of HMP applications and the investigation of alleged breaches of the TPO. He went to the property on 24 August 2005 following the receipt by the Council of a HMP application from Mr Parish in July 2005. He concluded that the property had been sustainably logged for a long time because he observed stumps on the property and unevenly aged trees.  
     
      
    41 Mr Hanlon went on to the property again in May/June 2006 after logging concluded. He noticed that selective logging had occurred, there were up to six log dumps and snig tracks. There were harvested heads of predominantly blackbutt trees lying in situ on the property. Most of the understorey on the property was intact and there was minimal damage to surrounding trees. Understorey, excluding ground cover, is a second canopy to the trees harvested. The height of the understorey ranged from 2.5m to 6m – 8m. 
     
      
    42 Mr Hanlon did not agree in cross-examination that the property was a “mess”. There were trees destroyed by heads falling and some disturbance to the understorey from the skidder and due to the history of the site, there were many existing snig tracks. He considered that not many trees had been left behind by the loggers. He agreed that he had an impression of the existence of the understorey and did not do any measurements of it in May/June 2006. 
     
      
    43 He went to the property on 3 August 2006 following a complaint and took photographs (which became exhibit T). He observed that most of the understorey that was present at the time of logging and post logging had been cleared. That understorey consisted of casuarina species, forest oak, black she-oak, eucalypt species such as stringy bark, blackbutt, a small amount of tallow wood, and turpentine. He also went to the property on 8 August 2006 with Ms Davine and Ms Fuller, town planner. He drove around the property and Ms Davine took photos. He flew over the property on 11 August 2006 and took aerial photographs. On 22 August 2006 he went to the property with another officer and identified, using a Global Positioning System (GPS), the location of each windrow, and recorded windrows 1 to 82. These were also numbered. On 5 September 2006 the GPS was used to plot windrows 83-119 on the property. On 20 September 2006 the GPS was used to plot the location of windrows 119 -142. A plan showing the location of the 142 windrows is in evidence.  
     
      
    44 On 13 September 2006 he returned to the property with two other Council officers and carried out a transect 20m x 20m in the rural zoned portion, close to where the clearing took place. He then counted the number of trees over 3m in height in that area and recorded 80 trees consisting of forest oak (the majority), stringy bark, blackbutt, bloodwood and turpentine. In oral evidence he stated ""the reason why the transept [transect] was carried out was to get an idea of the amount of trees that would have been in the industrial area prior to it being cleared"". When asked to describe the difference in appearance between the industrial land after logging but before clearing and the transect, he stated that they were the same and ""the understorey was intact comprising mainly of forest oak and young hardwood species from 2.5m – 8m in height"".  
     
      
    45 He also selected randomly a windrow in the southern section of the industrial zoned portion of the property, windrow number 2. The trees that could be sighted and measured at the outer edge or on top were identified. This could not include all vegetation as the windrow was made up of heaped trees and vegetation. A list was compiled of the number and measurement of 20 trees ranging from 2.5m to 17m consisting of mostly stringy bark, with some forest oak and bloodwood. Other windrows were also inspected, numbers 31, 104 and 135. Various numbers of trees in excess of 3m were identified, for number 31, four trees, number 104, ten trees and number 135, five trees. 
     
      
    46 Part of Mr Hanlon’s oral evidence involved him viewing photographs he had taken of some of the windrows created by Mr Lindsay, and identifying what he saw in the 13 photographs which were part of exhibit T. His general description of the property was that it was fully underscrubbed with piles of vegetation heaped up with green foliage with trees in excess of 3m in height. A video including voice-over taken of all the windrows on the property was objected to and not allowed into evidence. 
     
      
      Defendants on Hanlon evidence 
      
    47 Mr Hanlon’s evidence was criticised by the Defendants as being impressionistic as he was unable to identify in the photographs of windrows in exhibit T, and generally, which trees in the windrows were a result of the logging process in March/April and which were a result of Mr Lindsay’s cleaning up activity. In cross-examination he agreed he did not count any trees or take any notes when he went on the site in May/June 2006. He stated he went there to see if logging had been completed and to the Council’s satisfaction. When he went back on 3 August 2006 and saw a stark change he was comparing the property with the general impression he had when he visited the site in May or June 2006. He did not take any measurements of trees in May 2006. 
     
      
    48 The only specific oral evidence of what was in the windrows was given by Mr Hanlon when viewing the 13 photographs in Exhibit T and he identified very few specific trees by their exact length. Rather he gave his general impression that some trees were more than 3m.  
     
      
    49 There is no evidence to suggest that the assumptions made by Mr Hanlon in selecting the transect in the rural zone where he did were correct, that the transect area was logged to a similar extent to the industrial zoned land and had trees of a similar type and density to the rural land. This submission was based in part on the argument that it was not proved that the loggers logged south of Logans Crossing Road. The Defendants argued that it was not demonstrated that the loggers had logged from the south in the rural zoned area to the north. (I consider the oral evidence of the logging contractors confirms that they logged from south to the north on the property and therefore logged both the rural zoned land and the industrial zoned land. The only area they identify as having fewer harvestable logs was the area south of the powerlines which is at the very southern end of the rural zoned area of the property. This evidence is contrary to a written statement of Mr Toms provided to the Prosecutor where he said he logged north of Logans Crossing Road only). 
     
      
      Findings on evidence 
      
    50 The evidence of the logging contractors, Mr Lewis and Mr Toms, is that they undertook the logging of timber from 9 March 2006 to about six weeks later (end of April) in the area to the south of Logans Crossing Road and north up to the old homestead. According to Mr Lewis some trees were knocked over in this process. According to Mr Bartlett’s evidence based on exhibit U the last delivery of logs or woodchips to the Boral timber mill was 3 May 2006. The evidence in exhibit V of an invoice for 25 May 2006 was not ruled out by him. That suggests the logging operations continued beyond April into either early or late May 2006. 
     
      
    51 Mr Hagney from the Rural Fire Brigade states that he gave Mr Petro advice on 10 July 2006 about debris management for the purposes of burning off debris. That advice included reference to obtaining necessary approvals. What these were is unspecified in his evidence. 
     
      
    52 Mr Lindsay commenced work on the property on 17 or 18 July 2006 and continued for 12 days until 8 August 2006. His evidence about the instructions he received from Mr Armitage about tidying up the property for the fire service to burn is set out in detail at par 21. He understood the work was to be done for Mr Petro. His instructions were general and did not indicate whether any particular trees should be knocked over. As set out at par 21 it was up to him how the windrows were made and where and which trees were knocked over by him as part of the process of heaping up tree heads and creating the windrows. The careful approach he took is also identified at par 21, and at par 26 he states that he tried to use existing snig tracks as much as possible.  
     
      
       
      Evidence of state of property after Mr Lindsay’s cleaning up activity 
      
    53 Mr Lindsay’s evidence at par 22-25 about the number of trees over 3m that he knocked over during the twelve days he undertook the cleaning up work was generalised. The only specific estimate by him of the number of trees over 3m in height that he knocked over was approximately 150 damaged trees of about 8 inches in diameter and more than 3m, generally 4m – 4.5m, in height. The number of spindly oaks greater than 3m knocked over is harder to determine. The Prosecutor argued that while the exact number of trees over 3m is difficult to assess the number is large and in the vicinity of the 1,000 trees referred to in evidence by Ms Davine. Ms Davine and Mr Hanlon’s evidence of the number of trees over 3m in some of the windrows and Ms Davine’s overall impression of parkland clearing of about 1,000 trees supports a finding that a large number of trees over 3m were knocked over by Mr Lindsay.  
     
      
    54 The Defendants criticised the accuracy of the evidence of Mr Hanlon and Ms Davine relied on by the Prosecutor about the number of trees more than 3m in height because their evidence does not distinguish between trees felled or knocked over as part of the logging process undertaken by the logging contractors and left on the ground, and those cleared by Mr Lindsay. That criticism is well founded. The count of trees over 3m in the windrows referred to in Mr Hanlon’s affidavit (see par 45) does not state whether any had green foliage on them. While there is evidence from Mr Hanlon and Ms Davine that there were trees with green leaves in the windrows as identified in the photographs in Exhibit T and Exhibit N suggesting they were recently knocked over, there is no evidence about when the trees with green leaves were actually knocked over. I ruled during the hearing such evidence from Mr Hanlon was expert evidence and was inadmissible because no notice of it had been given to the Defendants. Accordingly, there is no accurate evidence of when the trees with green leaves in the windrows were actually or likely to have been knocked over. Trees could therefore have been knocked over during the logging operations in March/April/May 2006 as well as during the work carried out by Mr Lindsay. It is impossible on the basis of that evidence to say when any particular tree was knocked over, other than recently. 
     
      
    55 Mr Lindsay did not consider that the property had been parkland cleared. He considered that he was tidying up the property. 
     
      
      Evidence of state of property after logging by logging contractors 
      
    56 The evidence of the state of the property after the logging by the logging contractors from Mr Lindsay as stated in cross-examination is set out at par 26 and 27. He described the property as a “mess” and referred to the snig tracks and log dumps being cleared of vegetation with vegetation pushed to the side. The Defendants argued the area of land cleared in these areas was large, 22,500m2.  
     
      
    57 As set out in the transcript excerpted in par 27, Mr Lindsay was asked by the Defendants’ counsel whether he saw trees which had their heads taken off and left on the ground and he said “yes”. When asked if they had been left there because they did not have commercial value he replied “yeah, the ones that were broken off”. He agreed that there were smashed trees everywhere. There were also clearly a large number of tree heads left on the ground. 
     
      
    58 The Defendants emphasised that there were an unspecified number of trees knocked over as part of the logging operation, that the site was already cleared of vegetation along the snig track and log dumps and Mr Lindsay said only a few spindly oaks knocked over were more than 3m. 
     
      
    59 The Prosecutor relied on evidence of Mr Hanlon. Mr Hanlon stated that when he viewed the property after the logging in May/June 2006 he observed that most of the “understorey” was present, by which he meant a number of tree species which were not groundcover which formed a second canopy below the trees harvested. It looked typical of land after a sustainable harvesting of loggable timber. He did not undertake any tree counts at that time. 
     
      
    60 The transect evidence of Mr Hanlon at par 44 was relied on by the Prosecutor to demonstrate that the density of trees after logging in the industrial land was similar to that in the transect, which was rural land. His assumptions that:(i) the industrial land has trees of similar height and density to the rural land before logging;(ii) the rural and industrial land was logged at a similar intensity; 
     
      
      had to be proved to be correct beyond reasonable doubt.  
       
      
    61 In his evidence in chief he said that he had seen the industrial land after logging and before clearing and it was the same as the transect land. He did not specifically identify why he considered he could make these assumptions as would be required in giving expert evidence by Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 per Heydon JA at [85]. It is demonstrated by the evidence of the logging contractors that they logged on both sides of Logan Crossing Road. The only part of the whole property they identify as having less harvestable timber is the most southern part below the powerline. Mr Hanlon’s second assumption is likely to be correct. It is unknown what the basis for his first assumption is, other than stating he went on the property. 
     
      
    62 Mr Hanlon’s evidence does not prove beyond reasonable doubt which trees over 3m were knocked over as part of the logging process over the property and which were knocked over by Mr Lindsay. 
     
      
      Conclusion 
      
    63 There are essentially three categories of vegetation which can be considered in deciding how many trees knocked over by Mr Lindsay were over 3m, damaged trees, the spindly oaks and any remaining trees over 3m not in the first two categories. There is no doubt that Mr Lindsay did knock down some trees over 3m in height. Evidence which satisfies the onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt about the number of such trees is less clear cut.  
     
      
    64 The only specific evidence from Mr Lindsay of the number of trees knocked over was that he considered he had knocked over about 150 trees over 3m and up to 8m which were damaged. It is difficult to reach a final conclusion about the number of spindly oaks that might have been removed but given the widespread presence of these trees across the property so that they were amongst all the tree heads which had to be heaped up it is possible that there were a large number. It is also likely that most were small and under 3m, as Mr Lindsay stated, as they had been burned regularly by Mr Parish to control them, including at the end of last winter (see par 117). While Mr Lindsay stated that he had knocked over the “odd” one over 3m that results in a large number being knocked over across a large area of clearing activity of at least 23ha. 65 Mr Lindsay’s evidence is that there were up to eight small oaks in excess of 3m in a number of the windrows but not all of them. The number of trees more than 3m in height is unclear however it is likely to be several hundred assuming for example that up to 70 (about half) of the windrows have four spindly oaks more than 3m in them. That is a reasonable inference to draw based on Mr Lindsay’s evidence. 
     
      
    66 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a large number trees in excess of 3m and therefore covered by the TPO (subject to whether the Defendants are successful in proving that the TPO does not apply) were removed by the work carried out by Mr Lindsay on the property during the charge period. In addition to the approximately 150 damaged trees, the majority of these were likely to have been spindly oaks given their location in much of the debris Mr Lindsay had to move. This is an inference that can arise from the evidence of what Mr Lindsay did. 
     
      
    67 The evidence of how many other kinds of trees over 3m, meaning not damaged and not spindly oaks, were knocked over by Mr Lindsay is difficult to weigh up. The evidence of the state of the property after logging and before Mr Lindsay commenced work from Mr Hanlon and Ms Davine is impressionistic. This is not surprising as at that stage they could not have had any idea of the necessity to undertake any detailed assessment of the number of trees on the ground after logging. Mr Hanlon estimated these were few. That is to be contrasted with the evidence of Mr Lindsay that the property was a mess and there were trees “smashed” on the ground everywhere, the number of which is unspecified.  
     
      
    68 Additional evidence relied on by the Prosecutor are the tree counts carried out in a few windrows as identified in the affidavits of Mr Hanlon and Ms Davine. In the affidavit of Mr Hanlon the trees are recorded by name, length/height and diameter at 1400mm in windrows 2, 31, 104 and 135. There is no indication of when the trees identified were knocked over, for example, there is no reference to any of these having green leaves on them. The Defendants did not object to these parts of Mr Hanlon’s affidavit being read because they did not consider they had any probative value in the case, a correct assertion.  
     
      
    69 The only evidence that there were trees with green leaves and therefore recently knocked down is in photographs in exhibit T and exhibit N as identified by Mr Hanlon and Mr Davine respectively in oral evidence. As stated at par 54 I would not allow evidence from Mr Hanlon as to when the trees in the photographs were likely to have been knocked over except to state that this was recent. Given that logging occurred up to early or late May and Mr Lindsay conducted his work in mid to late July and early August this evidence does not rule out the possibility that some or all of the trees in the windrows that were not damaged and not spindly oaks were knocked over in the logging operation. The evidence of the trees in the few windrows identified in Exhibit T by Mr Hanlon was of limited assistance in understanding what was in the individual windrows in the photograph and what was across the site more generally. As submitted by the Defendants, Mr Hanlon did not identify many trees over 3m in the photographs in exhibit T shown to him in his oral evidence.  
     
      
    70 The evidence of Ms Davine that it was her impression that there were 1,000 trees removed did not state how tall the trees removed were. The Prosecutor’s counsel submitted that whenever she said “tree” she meant “tree over 3m to which the TPO applied” but that is not made clear in her evidence. This evidence does not prove to the criminal standard that that was the precise number of trees removed and was not intended to. It was admitted under s 78 of the Evidence Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        The opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion expressed by a person if:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) the opinion is based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived about a matter or event, and  
         
         
        (b) evidence of the opinion is necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of the person’s perception of the matter or event.  
         
         
        
       
      
    71 As identified in par 37, the basis for her estimate of 1,000 trees was the approximate number of trees over 3m (10) in windrows 2, 31, 104 and 135 referred to in Mr Hanlon’s affidavit. The difficulty with that evidence in failing to identify when particular trees were knocked down is identified at par 54. 
     
      
    72 I do not accept the Defendants’ argument at par 39 that the application of Ferrcom means that I should infer that her evidence on this matter, if asked, would not have assisted the Prosecutor’s case as the Prosecutor submitted. However all that evidence allows the Prosecutor to do is submit that she noticed a large number of trees had been removed between her visits to the property. 
     
      
    73 The Prosecutor has not established beyond reasonable doubt how many more trees over 3m beyond those I have already identified were knocked over by Mr Lindsay in the course of his cleaning up activity. 
     
      
      B. Has the TPO been breached? 
      
    74 The Prosecutor must first prove that Mr Lindsay’s action was a breach of the EP&A Act, namely a breach of the TPO. 
     
      
    75 According to the affidavit of Mr Rock, Council officer, dated 18 May 2007, the TPO and its amendment was published in a newspaper circulating in the Prosecutor’s council area. The TPO now states: 
     
      
       
      3. Basis 
       
      This Tree Preservation Order is made under the provisions of 
      
    (a) clause 20 of Hastings Local Environmental Plan 2001, and (b) clause 8 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Model Provisions 1980, as adopted by Hastings Local Environmental Plan 1987, and(c) section 32 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 
     
      
       
      … 
       
      5. Land covered by the order 
      
    (1) This order applies to all land within the Hastings Local Government Area, excluding land:(a) zoned Rural and located to the west of the North Coast Railway line; or(b) within a State Forest or reserved under the Forestry Act 1916; or(c) zoned 8(a) or controlled by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. 
     
      
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
      6. The tree preservation order 
      
    (1) a person must not destroy, or cause to be destroyed, a tree to which this tree preservation order applies other than in accordance with the written consent of the council. 
     
      
    (2) For the purposes of this Order a tree is:(a) a perennial plant or tree which is at least 3 m in height, or(b) a cycad or mangrove 
     
      
    (3) For the purposes of this Order destroy includes killing, clearing, removing, cutting, burning, ring barking, knocking over, poisoning, lopping, topping or cutting of living branches of a tree, its canopy or roots. 
     
      
       
      7. Exemptions:  
       
        
        This Order does not apply to tree removal listed below, although this does not override any other statutory requirement for consent or permission to be obtained: 
         
        … 
         
         
          
           
           (g)The property is being selectively and sustainably logged in accordance with a Harvest Management Plan that has been approved by Council. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    76 The TPO identifies land to which the TPO does not apply in cl 5. The subject property does not fall into any of the areas identified therein. Subject to one defence raised by the Defendants concerning continuing use rights, there is no dispute that the TPO applies to the property unless an exemption applies.  
     
      
    77 The Prosecutor accepts that it must prove that the TPO applies to the property and was made in accordance with cl 20 of the LEP. There is evidence that a TPO has been made pursuant to cl 20(2) of the LEP by resolution of the Council and was published in a newspaper circulating in the Prosecutor’s local government area on 3 December 2003 as required by cl 20(5) of the LEP. The Defendants did not dispute that the TPO was lawfully made. 
     
      
      (i) No  
      consent 
       or  
      permission 
       or  
      authority 
       to remove trees to which TPO applies – whether any  
      development consent 
       issued 
      
    78 The Prosecutor must prove that no development consents or other permission of the Prosecutor or authority under the EP&A Act is otherwise available to the Defendants as specified in cl 20(4) of the LEP. There is evidence that no development consent or specific TPO permissions applied to the property at the time Mr Lindsay did his work. The Council maintains a computer system that permits the search of records for development consents, Tree Preservation Order permissions and Harvest Management Plans. 
     
      
    79 No development consents have been issued that would permit the removal of trees on the property. No permits under the TPO had been issued that would permit the removal of trees. Only one HMP had been issued to Parish, the previous owner of the property, by the Prosecutor on 25 August 2005 valid for one year.  
     
      
       
      Finding that no development consent 
      
    80 I accept that the Prosecutor has established beyond reasonable doubt that there are no development consents in force as referred to in cl 20(4) of the LEP.  
     
      
    81 Two defences raised by the Defendants concern whether the work carried out by Mr Lindsay was pursuant to a permission (HMP) under the TPO or was otherwise authorised under the EP&A Act. The first defence is that the work was carried out pursuant to the HMP and was therefore within the exemption in cl 7(g) of the TPO. The second defence is that the work was able to be carried out in reliance on continuing use rights which the owner of the property has the benefit of.  
     
      
       
      (ii) Whether  
      permission 
       issued under TPO - has the Prosecutor proved that work by Mr Lindsay not carried out pursuant to HMP – does exemption in cl 7(g) of TPO apply? 
      
    82 The HMP issued by the Council for the property to its previous owner, Mr Parish on 25 August 2005, is in evidence. The HMP provides: 
     
      
       
        
        CONDITIONS OF CONSENT

    4. Single Tree Selection and Thinning operations must not result in the average Basal Area (measured in the square metres per hectare) of those parts of the forest where harvesting has occurred, excluding buffer strips, being reduced below the area stated in a harvest management plan application. 
     
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
    5. All harvested areas must be managed following harvesting in a manner that ensures:a. Regeneration of native vegetation species affected by harvesting, andb. Evidence of return towards pre harvesting forest structure.

    83 In the attached Harvest Management Plan Application referred to in Condition 1, the broad forest type to be logged is described as ""Coastal Blackbutt Type"". Under the heading ""Main Native Forest Species to be Harvested"", the boxes for Grey Ironbark, Bloodwood, Turpentine, Tallowwood, Red Mahogany, Coastal Blackbutt, Flooded Gum, Sydney Blue Gum have been ticked. ""Other Species"" is also ticked, with ""White Stringybark"" listed. 
     
      
    84 Under ""Forest Management History"", the application states  
     
      
       
       (i): The site has had a long history of timber harvest, grazing and fire. There is history of at least four timber harvests and light logging continued in each decade. The area has a long history of fire as evidenced by the blackness of many tree bases around the farm. 
        
       (ii) 
         
       Harvest techniques used: Thinning, Single Tree Selection and Australian Group Selection.  
        
       (iii)Years: 1875, 1930, 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000 
       .

       (viii) 
         
       Any other comments: forest is at its regular point in the growth cycle & it is due for harvesting. 
       
      
    85 Under “Regeneration Management”, the applicant is required to describe the “regeneration activities planned for each compartment of the harvest area”. The application states: 
     
      
       
        
        A key principle of Ecologically Sustainable Forest Management (ESFM) is long-term maintenances of the full suite of forest values of which the provision of adequate and vigorous regeneration is an important component. The silvicultural harvesting techniques applied at harvest will be the main contributors to this. Other post harvest regeneration activities may include the use of ground disturbance by machinery, the application of fire, and debris management. This is particularly applicable in the northern section. 
         
         
        The creation of gaps in the Australian Group Selection System will promote regeneration especially where the existing gaps are extended to provide an area large enough for regeneration to take place. 
         
         
        The area between the gaps will be thinned to promote growth on the remaining stems. 
         
         
        Post harvest the total area should have a regeneration burn. Note: This action is outside the time frame of this application and is dependent upon weather and legal requirements and therefore no timing can be given. 
        
       
      
    86 Logging pursuant to the HMP was carried out on the property in March, April and early May 2006 as identified in the oral evidence of Mr Lewis, Mr Bartlett and Mr Toms.  
     
      
       
      Prosecutor’s evidence and submissions 
      
    87 The Prosecutor argued that there is evidence to establish that the removal of trees the subject of the charge was not being carried out pursuant to the HMP. As identified in the Prosecutor’s written submissions; logging had occurred about two to three months before Mr Lindsay was on the property; Mr Lindsay went there after logging; Mr Lindsay understood his instructions to be to remove everything other than the larger trees; Mr Armitage told Mr Lindsay that “Eddy asked about the firies to burn and they said they wanted it tidied first”; and Mr Lindsay understood his role was to “tidy up the debris on the site”.88 Further, the logging pursuant to the HMP had been carried out by Mr Lewis and Mr Toms under the supervision of Mr Bartlett. The removal of trees pursuant to the HMP had been finished by early or late May 2006. The Prosecutor argued that at no time was it suggested to any witness, nor did any witness suggest, that any of the work that was being carried out by Mr Lindsay was pursuant to the HMP. Further, Mr Hanlon, the Prosecutor’s Tree Assessment Officer, inspected the logging to see if it “had been completed to the Council’s satisfaction in relation to the consent of the HMP”. Mr Hanlon’s evidence was that “logging had been done to Council’s satisfaction”.  
     
      
    89 The Prosecutor further argued that there was evidence of the reasons for the work by Mr Lindsay as identified in the affidavit of Ms Davine dated 13 October 2006 at par 5: 
     
      
       
        
        (Davine)  
        “What reason did you decide to clear out at Herrons Creek?”  
         
        (Petro)  
        “Under scrub, not clear.”  
         
        ( 
        Davine 
        ) “Alright why did you decide to underscrub?”  
         
        (Petro 
        ) “Fire risk purposes and to clean it up.”  
         
         (Davine) 
         “What instructions did you give to Bill Armitage?”  
        (Petro) 
         “I told him just to pile up all the rubbish, go through and clean up all the heads and everything, so the Rural Fire Service can burn it, as I had been told by the RFS.”  
         
        (Davine) 
         “… what can you say about the clearing out there?”  
        (Petro)  
        “I call it under scrubbing, not clearing. There were no big trees knocked down. Under the Surveying Act, they can under scrub for surveying purposes.”  
         
        (Davine) 
         “… Just one last question, why didn’t you clear the Rural zoned portion of the land if you were concerned about bushfire?” 
         
         (Petro) 
         “You can’t touch rural land and you know we were going to develop the industrial part.”  
        
       
      
    90 Further on 5 September 2006 Mr Hanlon was approached on site by two persons, including Mr Petro. As part of that conversation: (Hanlon) “ why was the property cleared?” (Petro) “We are under scrubbing for surveying purposes and heaping the piles up for bushfire risk.” Mr Hanlon’s affidavit dated 18 October 2006. 
     
      
    91 That evidence is not consistent with Mr Lindsay’s work being carried out pursuant to the HMP. 
     
      
       
      Defendants’ evidence and submissions 
      
    92 In oral submissions the Defendants submitted that as an HMP had been issued which applied to the property that was the end of the inquiry necessary. The HMP was issued for the property for one year from the date of determination and expired on 25 August 2006. As an HMP was in force for the property at the time the work was done the exemption in cl 7(g) applied.  
     
      
    93 Alternatively, if it is necessary to consider whether the HMP was complied with to determine if the exemption applies, the work by Mr Lindsay alleged to give rise to the offence occurred before the expiry date. Under the terms of the HMP there was no relevant limit on the trees that could be logged or on the clearing of any vegetation on the property. All of the activities carried out by Mr Lindsay on the site met the description of the activities which were mandated by the conditions of consent in the HMP and they all occurred within the one year currency of the HMP. Reliance was placed on the conditions of the HMP which included the application as referred to in Condition 1. A summary of the key paragraphs in the application relied on by the Defendants is set out above in par 82 - 85. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    94 The HMP involved more than logging: 
     
      
      (i) Conditions 4 and 5 concern silviculture and management post harvest; (see par 82) 
       
      (ii) At page 12 of the application, specific provisions are made for  
      “regeneration management” 
      . (see par 85) 
       
      (iii) This includes  
      “the application of fire and debris management” 
      . This is particularly applicable in the northern section (see par 85). 
       
      (iv)  
      “Post harvest” 
       the total area should have a  
      “regeneration burn” 
       (see par 85). 
       
      
    95 These are the activities with which Mr. Lindsay was involved: 
     
      
      (a) Mr Hagney from the Rural Fire Brigade went out on site with Mr Petro and advised Mr Petro about reducing the fire hazards left by the debris. He advised Mr Petro that if approvals were given  
      “they wouldn’t burn as they were on the ground, they would have to pushed up into management heaps before they could be burnt” 
      ;  
       
      (b) Mr Petro then engaged Mr Armitage to undertake this work. Mr Armitage in turn engaged Mr Lindsay; 
       
      (c) Mr Lindsay was tidying up for  
      “the firies” 
      : He knew from experience what the fire brigade wanted; 
       
      (d) Mr Lindsay understood his role was to tidy up the debris on the site, that is the management of all the debris on the site. 
       
      
    96 In his oral evidence Mr Parish asked his selling agent Mr Bird of LJ Hooker, Laurieton whether there would be any problem if they did an intensive log before the sale. Mr Parish stated that when he sold the property in 2006 he agreed with the buyer that he would log the property and at the conclusion of logging the buyer would take over the property. Mr Bird said he would expect the Parishes to complete the HMP as specified by the Council. The Parishes read it and worked out that to complete the requirements of the HMP was beyond their resources, that is, to go through and “lump all the trees together and burn them down and that sort of thing”. This is the matter referred to in special condition 38 of the contract of sale. 
     
      
    97 The former owner, Mr Parish, caused the logging operations on site to occur, but did not carry out any of the post logging clean up activities required by the conditions of the HMP as identified in the application under regeneration management. The activities of Mr Lindsay being tidying up the debris within the Harvest Management Plan is a hypothesis consistent with the evidence of Mr Parish: 
     
      
      (a) He understood the HMP as requiring the debris and the trees to be pushed together and burnt. This was beyond him so his real estate agent negotiated a specific clause in the contract for sale which imposed that obligation upon the purchaser; 
       
      (b) The Council specifically directed that  
      “you can’t leave your rubbish laying on the land, you’ve got to clear your rubbish up” 
      ; 
       
      (c)  
      “The Council insisted that that was part of the thing and I agree that’s good management plans, that you get rid of all the heads of your trees and that so you can plant other trees” 
      ; 
       
      (d) “ 
      Q. That’s part of the logging process? A. Yeah” 
      ; 
       
      (e) Mr. Parish assumed that this work was being undertaken by the logging company, not the owner of the property. Mr. Parish saw the heaping of heads. He answered (incorrectly) the logging company heaped up the heads and rubbish. He saw this work as part of the logging process. 
      
     
     
      
      Finding on whether permission under TPO - does HMP apply?  
      
    98 I held in Port Macquarie – Hastings Council v Lawlor Services Pty Limited; Port Macquarie – Hastings Council v Petro (No 5) [2007] NSWLEC 362 (Port Macquarie No 5) at [19] that the Prosecutor has the onus of establishing that cl 20(4) of the LEP applies. but that any exemption such as the application of cl 7(g) of the TPO must be proved by the Defendants. It is not therefore for the Prosecutor to negate the application of cl 7(g) of the TPO, rather the Defendants must establish on the balance of probabilities that the exemption applies to Mr Lindsay’s activities; see Avel Pty Ltd v Multicoin Amusements Pty Ltd (1990) 171 CLR 88 at 119 per McHugh J:  
     
      
       
        
        .. the onus of proof lies on the party alleging that he falls within the qualification, excuse or proviso… 
        
       
      
    99 While this finding was disputed in final submissions by the Defendants, who relied on Director of Public Prosecutions v United Telecasters Sydney Limited (1989 -1990) 168 CLR 594 at 600-601 to again argue the contrary, I consider my earlier decision is correct. Accordingly the Defendants bear the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that the activities of Mr Lindsay were carried out under the HMP. 
     
      
    100 The Defendants submitted that once the HMP applied to the property that was the end of the inquiry needed, in other words whether its terms were complied was irrelevant, or alternatively its terms were complied with. Either of those submissions must be supported by evidence that Mr Lindsay’s activities were pursuant to the HMP. 
     
      
    101 As submitted by the Prosecutor there is no evidence that the work conducted by Mr Lindsay was done under the HMP. At the time he was engaged to do the work by Mr Armitage there was no conversation which referred to the work being required by the HMP. In the conversations between Mr Petro and Ms Davine on 22 September 2006, as recorded in her affidavit and identified at par 89 above, there is no mention of the work being carried out pursuant to the HMP. Mr Petro stated to Ms Davine that the work by Mr Lindsay was underscrubbing for surveying purposes and heaping up the piles for burning to reduce bushfire risk.  
     
      
    102 The first time there was any reference to the HMP in relation to Mr Lindsay’s work was when Mr Petro’s counsel raised this defence in the “no case to answer” submission during the hearing. At that stage the argument was based solely on the application of the terms of the HMP. Reliance on those terms, which includes the application under condition 1, is not conclusive of the issue. The fact that the application refers to regeneration activities in broad terms does not suggest that extensive clearing work conducted some one to two months after the logging under the HMP had ceased in early or late May 2006 is work authorised by it. Further, burning is specifically stated not to be within the HMP timeframe. 
     
      
    103 The Defendants called Mr Parish to give oral evidence. The parts of his evidence relied on on this issue are set out in the Defendants’ submissions summarised above at par 96 and 97. The evidence of Mr Parish relied on by the Defendants is not conclusive that the work conducted by Mr Lindsay was pursuant to the HMP. For one obvious reason it cannot be as Mr Parish was the applicant for the HMP not Mr Lindsay or Mr Petro (or Mr Armitage). Mr Parish’s evidence confirms that he did not intend to undertake any of the clean up activity under the HMP. To that end he asked his real estate agent to negotiate condition 38 in the contract for sale of the property to Lawlor Services Pty Ltd. That condition states that “It is also agreed that there is no requirement on the Vendor of the need to clear all trees, or remove any stumps.” That casts no light on the extent to which clean up activities after the logging were conducted pursuant to the HMP by Mr Lindsay on the instructions of Mr Armitage who was in turn instructed by Mr Petro following his meeting with Mr Hagney.  
     
      
    104 There is no evidence that Mr Parish had any contact with Mr Petro, Mr Armitage or Mr Lindsay concerning the HMP and the regeneration activities referred to in the application. Accordingly, Mr Parish’s evidence that what he saw on the property was part of the logging process is not conclusive of that fact.  
     
      
    105 I do not consider the Defendants have established on the balance of probabilities that the exemption in cl 7(g) applies. Accordingly, this defence is not available to the Defendants. 
     
      
      
      (iii) Whether any other  
      authorisation 
       under TPO? Is defence of “continuing use” available? 
      
    106 Another defence raised by the Defendants, which they must prove on the balance of probabilities, is that Mr Lindsay’s activities were carried out pursuant to continuing use rights for logging and related activities due to the use of the property as a timber farm. Consequently, his activities were authorised under s 109(1) of the EP&A Act and were not therefore a breach of cl 20(4) of the LEP as the activity was otherwise authorised under the Act. Section 109(1) of the EP&A Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          Nothing in an environmental planning instrument operates so as to require consent to be obtained under this Act for the continuance of a use of a building, work or land for a lawful purpose for which it was being used immediately before the coming into force of the instrument or so as to prevent the continuance of that use except with consent under this Act being obtained.  
          
         
        
       
       
      Section 109(2)(b) provides: 
       
        
        (2) Nothing in subsection (1) authorises:  
        … 
         
          
          (b) any increase in the area of the use made of a building, work or land from the area actually physically and lawfully used immediately before the coming into operation of the instrument therein mentioned, or  
          
         
        
       
       
      Section 109(3) provides: 
       
        
        (3) Without limiting the generality of subsection (2) (e), a use is presumed, unless the contrary is established, to be abandoned if it ceases to be actually so used for a continuous period of 12 months.  
        
       
       
      Defendants’ submissions 
      
    107 The Defendants argued that the property the subject of the charge has been used for timber farming/forestry for about one hundred years. Timber farming/forestry is a use for a lawful purpose to which s 109 applies. Since 1988, under the LEP forestry is a permissible use requiring development consent in the industrial zone, hence s 109(1) applies. The Prosecutor stated in submissions that the forestry activity, meaning the logging which was undertaken in March/April 2006 by Mr Lewis and Mr Toms under the supervision of Mr Bartlett, was lawful. It therefore follows that the cleanup work carried out by Mr Lindsay was also lawful. 
     
      
    108 Further, because of continuing use rights for timber farming/forestry it was not in fact necessary for an application to be made for a HMP. Clause 20(4) of the LEP does not apply because the logging in March/April 2006 was authorised by virtue of s 109 and the clean up by Mr Lindsay afterwards is part of the lawful forestry activity. 
     
      
       
      Evidence 
      
    109 To prove continuing use as a timber farm the Defendants relied on the HMP application where a brief history of the use of the property is set out (see par 84) and the affidavit of Ms Davine dated 20 September 2006 par 4 stating the property had been a timber farm for 100 years (set out above at par 33). The oral evidence of Mr Parish, the previous owner of the property, was also relied on as follows.  
     
      
       
      Parish 
      
    110 Mr Parish stated that the property was owned by the Parish family from at least 1931. It had been a timber farm for its entire history. Mr Parish and his father before him felled trees from his father’s time up until the sale to Lawlor Services Pty Ltd on 17 February 2006. Throughout that period trees were felled at the rate of one per month and there was more substantial felling for the cutting down of all millable timber. 
     
      
    111 Two major contracts occurred when his father died in 1960-1962. Mr Parish sold a contract to a power company for electric light poles. At other times there has been a number of bigger cuttings. These were a means of raising money to keep the property going. The 2006 logging was not the biggest job Mr. Parish had done. There were more than the three big logging jobs he mentioned. The whole property was logged in the 1960s. 
     
      
    112 The property was farmed as a blackbutt farm with very small quantities of other species also harvested. Mr Parish planted blackbutt trees and to get maximum output he would control the density of trees by pulling out some and planting other trees where needed to maintain correct density for maximum timber growth. Planting of blackbutts was continuous from 1927 including in 2005 and 2006, up to the sale to Lawlor Services Pty Ltd, see exhibit 3. Mr Parish stated he replanted blackbutts fellrd within 12 months. The trees are planted for suitable spacing and the felled tree rubbish has to be cleared away. Single trees were taken from all over the property. 
     
      
    113 It was the timber company’s idea to approach the Council for an HMP. The Council said it invariably submits an application. Mr. Parish was not aware he needed approval. Mr. Parish told the timber company the Council had assured him it was an ongoing timber farm and no approvals were necessary. 
     
      
       
      Use of fire 
      
    114 Mr Parish has continued his father’s practice of continued burning of combustible material on the property which had no economic value. He kept a strict watch on combustible material because fire (bushfire) can retard blackbutt growth and delay the harvest period by ten years. On average about every two years he would burn off to get rid of the bladey grass, oaks, and other rubbish and leaves to increase blackbutt growth. 
     
      
    115 Oaks (identified as the tree seen in exhibit T) stop blackbutts growing. Mr Parish and his sons tried to minimise the growth of oaks and bladey grass as much as possible. The oaks were “pure rubbish” to him. When fire goes through they “look quite thin” as in the photo (exhibit T). 
     
      
    116 When the property was burnt every two years he was invariably present. On occasions the fire brigade was responsible for the fire. Other times he would do it with gear borrowed from the fire brigade. Burning is seasonal and there are particular time and weather conditions needed and the Rural Fire Brigade needed to be available. 
     
      
    117 The last fire Mr Parish put through the property was towards the end of winter last year. That was the northern section. The year before the southern section was burnt. He always put fire through the property towards the end of winter before the fire restrictions commenced. The fire is to protect the trees (and the house). Always after a big logging exercise, fire is put through the property, subject to the weather pattern. The property was burnt every time it needed to be burnt. A lot of experience is needed to know when and what to do. 
     
      
       
      HMP terms  
      
    118 Mr Parish's evidence confirms the history set out in the HMP application. In particular, it refers to “Forest Management History” and “Harvest techniques to be used”: “Thinning” and “single tree selection” (selective logging). The “previous harvesting operations within the harvest area” (p 9) refers inter alia to the “1950s” and every decade up to and including the “1990s” and “2000”. Page 10 of the HMP refers to the “growth cycle” of the forest being at its “regular point” in that cycle and due for harvest; see par 84. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion based on facts according to the Defendants 
      
    119 The evidence recounted above justifies the following findings of fact according to the Defendants. The whole of the property (Lot 186) has been used at all material times for forestry consisting of and including the planting, growing and nurturing of trees; the general management of the forest including thinning, underscrubbing and rubbish removal; the use of fire by regular application to the whole of the forest. All of these activities have been continuously carried out on the whole of the property.  
     
      
    120 The consequence of these facts is: 
     
      
      (a) There are continuing use rights for the whole of the property for harvesting that was ongoing, both as light logging of individual trees coupled with cyclical major logging exercises, indicates that the whole of the forest was subject to logging, debris management and the application of fire at all times; 
      
      
      (b) No question of limitation on the area actually physically used arises under s.109 (2)(b) because the whole of the property was occupied and used for the purposes of these harvesting activities; 
       
        
        No question of abandonment arises because of the continuation of the use; 
        
       
      (c) Even if, which on the evidence is an untenable proposition, it could be asserted that the use of fire, the major logging exercises or any other aspect mentioned above occurred with a lapse of time greater than 12 months, it is clear that there is evidence contrary to abandonment due to the cyclical nature and continuously repeated nature of the harvesting activities; 
       
      (d) At all material times during the period of the charge, continuing use rights subsisted relevantly, for the purposes of under scrubbing, clearing of unwanted species, debris management, and preparation of the property for burning the entire property. 
       
      
    121 The evidence is consistent in indicating that the post logging activities of windrowing following consultation with the Rural Fire Service, the under scrubbing and clearing of unwanted vegetation were usual activities undertaken on the property. No blackbutt species were said by any witness to have been harmed in any way, and the preparation of the property for the application of fire was wholly within continuing use rights. The defence that Mr Lindsay’s work was conducted pursuant to continuing use rights under s109 is available and the charge against each of the Defendants should be dismissed. 
     
      
    122 The Prosecutor’s case relied on the logging under the HMP being conducted lawfully and that could only be the case if that activity had continuing use rights under s 109(1). Forestry which must include that logging activity by the contractors otherwise needed development consent under the relevant LEP. (The Prosecutor argued to the contrary that the taking of trees which was authorised by the HMP did not require development consent as it was not characterised as forestry, which would have required development consent. It is unnecessary that I resolve this argument).  
     
      
       
      Prosecutor’s submissions 
      
    123 The Prosecutor characterised the use of the property as logging. One use was very infrequent logging over the whole of the property. The other use is on the basis of the logging of one tree per month. Neither of these uses is sufficiently substantial to warrant a finding that either or both together were an independent use. The analogy was drawn with the irregular chopping down of a tree for a fencepost. 
     
      
    124 In relation to the logging of the whole of the property, the HMP states that there was a timber harvest in 1875, 1930 and 2000 and light logging in the decades: 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Mr Parish, in his oral evidence, confirmed that the materials and matters set out in the HMP were correct and that the whole property has been logged on at least three occasions. It was logged after the war, so that his father could buy a car. In the 1960’s after his father’s death it was also logged again to raise funds from logging for the surviving brothers. There was logging in 2006 under the HMP. As the evidence of the last logging of the whole of the property before 2006 was in 2000, the rebuttable presumption of abandonment arises under s 109(3) of the EP&A Act. The presumption having arisen the onus falls on the Defendants to rebut it on the balance of probabilities. 125 In addition, Mr Parish’s evidence demonstrates that there has been the opportunistic felling of trees on the property for reward over a lengthy period of time. There has been opportunistic planting of saplings to replace the removed trees within 12 months of their removal. The regularity would appear, at best, to be one tree per month. According to Mr Parish’s evidence, the purpose for which the trees were felled and sold was: “mainly use to get money to keep the property going”. Such a use is not an independent use of the property but an ancillary use. It cannot give rise to any continuing use rights under s 109.  
     
      
    126 Even if s 109 does apply it must be read as a whole. Section 109(2)(b) applies so that the intensification of the use is not permitted, see Lemworth Pty Limited v Liverpool City Council (2001) 117 LGERA 305 and Vaughan-Taylor v David Mitchell-Melcann Pty Ltd (1991) 73 LGRA 366. The benefit of the use only applies to the area of land being physically used at the relevant date. In this case that means that if the use is for the taking of a single tree once per month the area of property used at the time of the introduction of LEP 2001 is relevant.127 Finally, even if there are continuing use rights for a tree farm over the whole of the property including the logging of the whole of the property, the work conducted by Mr Lindsay did not come within the usual scope of the work underpinning such a use. In his oral evidence Mr Parish was asked if he had ever used a bulldozer to clear the property and he stated no. The purpose of engaging Mr Lindsay to undertake the work was underscrubbing for surveying purposes, and cleaning up the site for fire to occur as part of preparing the property for industrial development, according to Mr Petro’s statements to Ms Davine. Mr Lindsay’s activity does not fit into the use of the property for the purpose of either a timber farm or forestry. 
     
      
       
      Finding on continuing use defence 
      
    128 The Defendants bear the onus of proof on the balance of probabilities that they have continuing use rights over the whole of the property for harvesting of timber for use as a timber farm, whether by individual trees taken monthly and/or by logging across the whole of the property at infrequent intervals, and that use includes work of the nature undertaken by Mr Lindsay. The use relied on was also submitted to be forestry within the meaning of the LEP. In the Dictionary to the LEP, forestry is defined to include: 
     
      
       
        
        arboriculture, silviculture, forest protection, the cutting, dressing and preparation, otherwise than in a saw mill, of wood and other forest products and the establishment of roads required for the removal of wood and forest products and for forest protection. 
        
       
      
    129 The relevant date at which continuing use rights must be established according to the Defendants is 1988, as that is when the LEP required development consent for forestry. Until that date development consent was not required. 
     
      
      (i) characterisation of the use 
      
    130 It is necessary for the Court to characterise the use as being for a purpose. The purpose of the use must be identified at a “level of generality which is necessary and sufficient to cover the individual activities and transactions or processes carried on at the relevant date"", see Royal Agricultural Society of NSW v Sydney City Council (1987) 61 LGRA 305 at 310 as quoted in Chamwell Pty Ltd v Strathfield Council [2007] NSWLEC 114 at [36], also Shire of Perth v O’Keefe [1964] 110 CLR 529 at 535 per Kitto J. The use need not be confined by terms in a planning instrument. If “the activities are capable of being treated as all or the majority of the species of a genus, then that genus may properly be regarded as describing the purpose of the use of the land. If not, the land may have been used for more than one purpose; Royal Agricultural Society v Sydney City Council at 311, per McHugh J A.  
     
      
    131 I consider that the evidence relied on by the Defendants including that of Mr Parish, see par 110 -113, establishes that there was a use of the property as a tree farm for the propagation of blackbutt which took place over the whole of the property in terms of the harvesting of one tree per month. This included the cultivation of blackbutt trees by the replacement of saplings and in relation to the general management of the property over an extended period including by the use of fire to control the growth of unwanted trees. The logging of the whole of the property which has occurred infrequently, approximately three or four times since 1931, is not a separate use but part of the use of the property as a tree farm. During the period Mr Parish was helping his father manage the property or as sole owner from the 1960s the property has been managed to ensure the propagation of blackbutt trees in particular. 
     
      
      (ii) has the continuing use been abandoned? 
      
    132 As I have accepted that the purpose of a tree farm/forestry is a continuing use on the property for both the taking of single species and for logging across the whole property I do not consider that the presumption of abandonment in s 109(3) arises given the history of that use identified in Mr Parish’s evidence.  
     
      
    133 Having made that finding, this matter is now determined on the issue of whether Mr Lindsay’s activities come within that use. It is not therefore necessary in my view that I resolve the arguments on whether the use has been intensified in breach of s 109(2). 
     
      
      (iii) does the cleaning up work by Mr Lindsay come within the scope of the use? 
      
    134 Accepting therefore that continuing use rights exist for the purpose of a tree farm does the work undertaken by Mr Lindsay come within the scope of that continuing use? There is evidence of the use of fire by Mr Parish at par 114 -117 where he attests that this was used approximately every two years as part of the management of vegetation on the property. Part of the purpose of the fire was to kill the spindly oaks. There is no evidence of what cleaning up work was done leading up to that fire activity. Given the evidence of Mr Parish that virtually all the time the principal taking of trees was at the rate of one per month, I infer there was not the debris such as that found after this logging operation across the whole property which required management. There was no evidence from Mr Parish about what cleaning up work was undertaken after a logging operation across the whole property on the very few occasions occurred. Mr Parish stated that he had never used and was not aware of having arranged for a bulldozer to be used to clean up the property after logging. This suggests that Mr Lindsay’s activities were not within the continuing use of the property. 
     
      
    135 The Prosecutor submitted, correctly, there is no evidence to suggest that what Mr Lindsay did was related to a tree farm/forestry use of the property. The reason for the work being carried out given by Mr Petro to Ms Davine is not related to the use as a tree farm or forestry but for industrial development. This evidence was identified earlier at par 88 and 89 in relation to the previous defence and is relied on in the Prosector’s submissions at par 127, which I accept.  
     
      
    136 My view that the cleaning up by Mr Lindsay was not within the usual activities encompassed by the tree farm/forestry use is further confirmed by the fact that Mr Lindsay was not asked to also clear up the rural zoned land which was also logged at the same time as the industrial land. The evidence of the loggers is that the rural zoned land was logged in a similar way to the industrial land apart from one portion in the most southern section “below” the powerline. Mr Petro responded to Ms Davine that the rural land was not cleared because that cannot be touched.  
     
      
    137 The Defendants have not established on the balance of probabilities that the cleaning up by Mr Lindsay is part of the use for which the property has continuing use rights to which s 109(1) applies. Accordingly this defence is unsuccessful. The TPO has accordingly been breached. During the hearing Mr Lindsay was granted a certificate under s 128(3) of the Evidence Act. Section 128(7) provides that "" evidence given by a person in respect of which a certificate under this section has been given. . . cannot be used against the person” in any proceedings in a New South Wales court (apart from proceedings regarding falsity of the evidence). 
     
      
      C. Joint criminal enterprise 
      
    138 In opening, the Prosecutor argued the offence committed by Mr Petro was that of a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Lindsay, the bulldozer driver who knocked over the trees over 3m the subject of the charge. The Defendants requested particulars in relation to the joint criminal enterprise alleged by the Prosecutor on the second day of the hearing and the Prosecutor provided the following answers:  
     
      
      Particulars 
      
    1. Precisely what is alleged to have been the common purpose reflected in the joint criminal enterprise? 
     
      
       
       Answer: The wilful destruction of trees to which the Hastings Tree Preservation Order 2003 applied, contrary to the provisions of cl 20 of the Hastings Local Environmental Plan 2001 on Lot 186 DP 754405 (the Site) during the period 1 July 2006 to 8 August 2006. 
       
      
    2. What are the terms of the agreement or understanding? 
     
      
       
       Answer: To the extent the agreement or understanding was express, Edmund Petro was present on the Site regularly (if not daily) during the commission of the physical acts the subject of the joint criminal enterprise by Dean Lindsay. During those times Edmund Petro confirmed that he was both satisfied with the works being carried out by Dean Lindsay and that Dean Lindsay should continue with those works. 
       
       
       To the extent the agreement or understanding was implied or tacit, Edmund Petro was present on the Site regularly (if not daily) during the commission of the physical acts the subject of the joint criminal enterprise by Dean Lindsay. 
       
      
    3. Was the alleged agreement or understanding express or implied? 
     
      
       
       Answer: The agreement between Edmund Petro and Dean Lindsay was express and/or implied. 
       
      
    4. If express, was it:(a) wholly or partly in writing;(b) wholly or partly oral;(c) wholly or partly implied? 
     
      
       
       Answer:  
        
        (a) No 
         
        (b) partly oral 
         
        (c) partly implied 
        
       
      
    5. If wholly or partly in writing, please identify each document and provide us with a copy of it. 
     
      
       
       Answer: Nil 
       
      
    6. If wholly or partly oral state:Answer: See answer to [2] above.7. If wholly or partly implied, state the facts, matters and circumstances relied upon as giving rise to the implication. 
     
      
      Answer: See answer to [2] above. 
      
    139 In the no case judgment Port Macquarie (No 5) at [28], I found that the wilful destruction of trees in breach of a TPO was a strict liability offence in that mens rea is not an essential element of the offence. The removal of trees must be intentional, not accidental, as is the case with Mr Lindsay’s activities. I did not uphold the Defendants’ no case application on the issue of whether there can be criminal liability for a strict liability offence on the basis of joint criminal enterprise as that argument appeared to be open on a theoretical basis at that preliminary point. As noted in the no case decision at [30], this is apparently the first time that such an offence has been prosecuted in this Court. In any event, no authority from this Court concerning joint criminal enterprise in relation to a strict liability charge was provided. In the course of argument one case, Lloyd v Snooks (1997) 94 A Crim R 314 at first instance and Lloyd v Snooks (1999) 153 FLR 339, 9 Tas R 41 on appeal was relied on by the Prosecutor. 
     
      
    140 This offence is charged under s 125(1) of the EP&A Act, that is, an offence under the Act to do a matter or thing which is prohibited.  
     
      
       
      1. Is charge of joint criminal enterprise available? 
       
      Prosecutor’s submissions 
      
    141 In a joint criminal enterprise there is only one actus reus, in this case that was clearly committed by Mr Lindsay. Any other person who is jointly criminally liable is guilty of the same offence. It is not necessary for the physical perpetrator to be prosecuted. Mr Lindsay has not been. Mr Petro is liable as a principal in the first degree. Joint criminal enterprise can arise for a strict liability offence. The principles in Osland v R (1998) 159 ALR 170, R v Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 apply. Such an offence was proved in Lloyd v Snooks.  
     
      
      Defendants’ submissions 
      
    142 There is no authority supporting the application of the principle of joint criminal enterprise to a strict liability regulatory offence. Strict liability offences are a particular category of offence. While Tiger Nominees Pty Ltd v State Pollution Control Commission (1992) 75 LGRA 71 held that a party may be vicariously liable for a strict liability offence, a party would not be vicariously liable for acts of an independent contractor such as Mr Lindsay; Director-General of Department of Land and Water Conservation v Greentree & Anor [2002] NSWLEC 102 at [91] – [93]. 
     
      
    143 The principles in Tangye adopted in Osland require that there be a pre-concert or agreement by the accused with the person committing the crime and that the accused be present at the commission of the crime. Fundamental to an agreement, pre-concert or understanding to commit a crime is knowledge and intention that the acts which constitute the crime are to be committed. Agreement requires a mental element which arguably cannot exist for a strict liability offence. 
     
      
      Finding on joint criminal enterprise - is charge available 
      
    144 Before examining the relevant evidence, the fundamental issue arises of whether Mr Petro is able at law to be criminally liable, as a principal in the first degree, by reason of a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Lindsay. In McAuliffe v R (1995) 183 CLR 108 by Brennan CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gummow JJ their Honours stated at 113: 
     
      
       
        
        The doctrine of common purpose applies where a venture is undertaken by more than one person acting in concert in pursuit of a common criminal design. Such a venture may be described as a joint criminal enterprise. Those terms – common purpose, common design, concert, joint criminal enterprise – are used more or less interchangeably to invoke the doctrine which provides a means, often an additional means, of establishing the complicity of a secondary party in the commission of a crime. 
        
       
      
    145 The distinction between different types of joint criminal enterprise is found in Tangye per Hunt CJ at CL at 556, where his Honour stated (McInerney, Sully JJ concurring):  
     
      
       
        
        The Crown needs to rely upon a straightforward joint criminal enterprise only where – as in the present case – it cannot establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was the person who physically committed the offence charged. It needs to rely upon the extended concept of joint criminal enterprise, based upon common purpose, only where the offence charged is not the same as the enterprise agreed. This Court has been making that point for years, and it is a pity that in many trials no heed is taken of what has been said. 
        
       
       
      The Prosecutor relied on straightforward criminal enterprise. 
       
      
    146 Tangye was further quoted with approval in Osland. In Osland, McHugh J (Kirby, Callinan JJ concurring) held at [72] – [75]: 
     
      
       
        
        However, there is a third category where a person was not only present at the scene with the person who committed the acts alleged to constitute the crime but was there by reason of a pre-concert or agreement with that person to commit the crime. In that category, the liability of each person present as the result of the concert is not derivative but primary. He or she is a principal in the first degree. In that category each of the persons acting in concert is equally responsible for the acts of the other or others. The general principle was clearly stated in R v Lowery and King (No 2) by Smith J who directed the jury in the following terms:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ""The law says that if two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement that together they will commit a crime and then, while that understanding or arrangement is still on foot and has not been called off, they are both present at the scene of the crime and one or other of them does, or they do between them, in accordance with their understanding or arrangement, all the things that are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of that crime regardless of what part each played in its commission. In such cases they are said to have been acting in concert in committing the crime.""  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In that case, his Honour directed the jury that ""they are all equally guilty of that crime"". But as subsequent cases show, and as principle requires, the correct statement is that they are all equally liable for the acts that constitute the actus reus of the crime. The principle is accurately stated by Brett, Waller and Williams in the 8th edition of their work on Criminal Law:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ""[E]ven if only one participant performed the acts constituting the crime, each will be guilty as  
          principals in the first degree 
           if the acts were performed in the presence of all and pursuant to a preconceived plan. In this case, the parties are said to be acting in concert."" [emphasis added] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        So far as is presently relevant, these principles were accurately and more fully stated by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Tangye. The Court said:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ""(1) The law is that, where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other or others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused.  
           
          (2) A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express, and its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any time before the crime is committed. The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime.  
           
          (3) A person participates in that joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed"".  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In accordance with the New South Wales practice, the Court referred to ""carrying out a criminal enterprise"" rather than acting in concert. The principles, however, are the same.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        As a result, a person may be found guilty of murder although he or she did not commit the acts which physically caused the death of the victim and the person who did is found guilty only of manslaughter. In  
        R v Howe 
        , all their Lordships were of the opinion that  
        R v Richards 
        , which had held that the person who did not perform the acts could not be guilty of a more serious charge than the actual perpetrator, was wrongly decided. Lord Mackay said:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ""[W]here a person has been killed and that result is the result intended by another participant, the mere fact that the actual killer may be convicted only of the reduced charge of manslaughter for some reason special to himself does not, in my opinion in any way, result in a compulsory reduction for the other participant.""  
           
          
         
        This statement is conclusive in England, at all events, in showing that it is the acts, and not the crime, of the actual perpetrator which are attributed to the person acting in concert. If the latter person has the relevant mens rea, he or she is guilty of the principal offence because the actus reus is attributed to him or her by reason of the agreement and presence at the scene. It is irrelevant that the actual perpetrator cannot be convicted of that crime because he or she has a defence such as lack of mens rea, self-defence, provocation, duress or insanity.  
        [footnotes omitted] 
        
       
      
    147 McHugh J considers a number of further authorities before concluding at [93]: 
     
      
       
        
        Where the parties are acting as the result of an arrangement or understanding, there is nothing contrary to the objects of the criminal law in making the parties liable for each other's acts and the case for doing so is even stronger when they are at the scene together. If any of those acting in concert but not being the actual perpetrator has the relevant mens rea, it does not seem wrong in principle or as a matter of policy to hold that person liable as a principal in the first degree. Once the parties have agreed to do the acts which constitute the actus reus of the offence and are present acting in concert when the acts are committed, the criminal liability of each should depend upon the existence or non-existence of mens rea or upon their having a lawful justification for the acts, not upon the criminal liability of the actual perpetrator. So even if the actual perpetrator of the acts is acquitted, there is no reason in principle why others acting in concert cannot be convicted of the principal offence. They are responsible for the acts (because they have agreed to them being done) and they have the mens rea which is necessary to complete the commission of the crime. 
        
       
      
    148 While Gaudron and Gummow JJ dissented in Osland on another issue (the principle of causation), at [27] they also agreed on the reasoning of McAuliffe v R : 
     
      
       
        
        More to the point, principle dictates the conclusion that those who form a common purpose to commit a crime together are liable as principals if they are present when the crime, or any other crime within the scope of the common purpose is committed by one or more of them. The crime having been committed in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all are equally guilty as principals regardless of the part played by each. That result follows from the reasoning in  
        McAuliffe v R 
        . Indeed, that reasoning would appear not to require presence at the scene of all parties to the continuing common purpose if the criteria specified in that reasoning otherwise are satisfied.  
        
       
      
    149 For complete clarity I observe that in Osland, the principles stated by Hunt CJ in Tangye were truncated. Principles 1 and 2 are quoted exactly in Osland. Principles 3 and 4 in Tangye at 557 are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        A person participates in that joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed, and (with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being committed) by intentionally assisting or encouraging another participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime. The presence of that person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give aid if required is sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        If the agreed crime is committed by one or other of the participants in that joint criminal enterprise, all of the participants in that enterprise are equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission. 
        
       
      
    150 As submitted by the Prosecutor, joint criminal enterprise is not the same charge as one based on secondary participation based on common purpose or accessorial liability, as the Prosecutor described it. An example of the latter is a charge of “aid and abet” considered in Giorgianni v R (1984 -1985) 156 CLR 473 and ""extended common purpose"" in R v Taufahema, (2007) 234 ALR 1, both cases relied on by the Defendants in the “no case to answer” submissions. A charge based on accessorial liability requires that the prosecutor prove that the defendant knew of all the facts and circumstances which must be established to prove that the principal committed the offence. That is not the basis on which the Prosecutor has charged Mr Petro.  
     
      
    151 Both Tangye (charges of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and assault) and Osland (charge of murder) concern offences which included mens rea as an element of the offence, unlike this strict liability offence arising under s 125(1) of the EP&A Act. There is reference to having the necessary mens rea in the judgment of McHugh J in Osland at [93] par 147 above. Consequently, the issue arises of whether the common law offence of joint criminal enterprise can apply to a statutory charge under s 125(1) of the EP&A Act where the offence charged is a strict liability offence and mens rea, meaning intention to commit the crime, is not an essential element in proving the offence. In the absence of an intention to commit a crime it is difficult conceptually to conceive of a charge based on establishing knowledge of and reaching an agreement to commit a crime, as the Defendants submitted.  
     
      
    152 Given that the Prosecutor is seeking to have common law criminal liability principles apply to a statutory offence, it is first necessary to consider cases where common law principles of criminal liability for acts committed by others has been applied to strict liability offences. In Tiger Nominees the Court of Criminal Appeal (Gleeson CJ, Mahoney JA and Campbell J concurring) held that as a matter of statutory construction s 16(1) of the Clean Waters Act 1970 may operate to make a master vicariously responsible for the conduct of an employee. In arriving at that conclusion the Chief Justice considered the development of common law principles in relation to the imposition of criminal responsibility as a principal for the acts of others, see page 74. Principles were derived from offences described as “public welfare offences”. Examples he gave were fair trading, consumer protection and environmental protection laws. This was held by his Honour to be an appropriate context for construing legislation on the question of whether Parliament had expressly or by implication created a criminal offence for which a person could be found vicariously responsible. Such statutory offences must be capable of vicarious commission.  
     
      
    153 Principals have been found guilty in this Court based on vicarious liability for acts committed by agents in relation to s 125(1) offences, see Power v Penthill House Pty Ltd (1993) 80 LGERA 247 at 252-254, Mosman Municipal Council v Waratah Village Partners Pty Ltd [2002] NSWLEC 184 at 37-39. As noted in Power v Penthill, s 125 is the only provision creating offences under the EP&A Act.  
     
      
    154 Vicarious liability applying to criminal offences which are strict liability was considered by Lloyd J in Greentree in relation to a charge of illegally clearing native vegetation under the Native Vegetation and Conservation Act 1997. The Defendants relied on this decision because it confirmed the principle that principals are not vicariously liable for the acts of independent contractors. I note that finding is subject to two exceptions identified by Lloyd J at [92]. The Defendants considered this supported their argument that there cannot be liability on the basis of joint criminal enterprise. As noted by Lloyd J in Greentree at [93] the question of whether vicarious liability (in that case) exists “ultimately depends on the circumstances of the case and the proper construction of the relevant statutory provision”.  
     
      
    155 The same reasoning concerning the nature of the statutory scheme which was applied in Power v Penthill to conclude that vicarious liability for s 125(1) offences and in Tiger Nominees to an offence under the Clean Waters Act is also applicable in relation to a charge under s 125(1) based on joint criminal enterprise in my view. The objects of the EP&A Act are.  
     
      
       
        
        (a) to encourage:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the proper management, development and conservation of natural and artificial resources, including agricultural land, natural areas, forests, minerals, water, cities, towns and villages for the purpose of promoting the social and economic welfare of the community and a better environment,

    156 In light of these objects of the legislation the offence under s 125(1) is a “public welfare” offence, as identified in Tiger Nominees. It is a statutory context in which the legislature could contemplate that liability as a principal on the basis of joint criminal enterprise could arise for an offence under s 125(1) of the EP&A Act.  
     
      
    157 The issue then becomes whether this statutory offence is capable of commission on the basis of joint criminal enterprise as identified by the principles in Tangye/Osland. The Prosecutor relied on Lloyd v Snooks as an example of a person being found guilty as a principal for a statutory offence which was strict liability. That case concerned the taking of undersize abalone, a strict liability offence under the relevant legislation. The Tasmanian Supreme Court (Full Court) did not refer to liability on the basis of joint criminal enterprise or to the principles in Tangye and Osland. It did find the defendant liable as a principal for a strict liability offence in circumstances where the evidence did not support a charge of aiding and abetting because there was not sufficient evidence to prove that the defendant was aware of all the essential facts constituting the principal offence as required for a charge of aid and abet. He was directly engaged in the commission of the act in that he pulled up from the sea bags of undersized abalone filled by someone else who prised the undersized abalone off the rocks. The basis for the finding of liability as a principal appears to be that he carried out part of the act constituting the offence. It is not therefore a case of joint criminal enterprise as identified in Osland and Tangye.158 The principles in Osland and Tangye are directed to crimes in which mens rea is an essential element of the crime. On a strict application of the principles in Tangye as adopted in Osland the absence of mens rea as a necessary element of a strict liability offence means that such an offence cannot be committed on the basis of a joint criminal enterprise as identified in those cases. This is because the necessary agreement to commit a crime does not arise, because no intention to commit a crime need be proved to establish guilt in the case of a strict liability offence. The Defendants’ argument that knowledge of the intention to commit a crime is necessary to enable there to be an agreement that it be committed is certainly an argument open on reading the principles in Osland and Tangye. If the principles in Osland and Tangye must be applied unmodified then I agree with the Defendants that there is not a charge of joint criminal enterprise open for this strict liability offence.  
     
      
    159 Applying the principles in Tangye and Osland, the Prosecutor did submit that the evidence establishes that Mr Petro knew that trees greater than 3m were being destroyed by Mr Lindsay in breach of the TPO but this was not the primary argument of the Prosecutor nor the case which the evidence was directed to. While the Prosecutor relied on the principles in Osland/Tangye without modification its main argument was that provided it established that Mr Petro agreed with Mr Lindsay that Mr Lindsay do the clearing up activity, and Mr Petro participated by his presence when the clearing up activity occurred and trees over 3m were knocked over by Mr Lindsay in doing that work, that is sufficient to prove joint criminal enterprise in the context of this strict liability offence. The only necessary intention about which there had to be agreement was that clearing up work was to be carried out by Mr Lindsay. The application of these principles in the Prosecutor’s argument, albeit by implication, is that the agreement that must be proved is not an agreement to commit a crime per se only to do the act which constituted the strict liability offence. If I assume that the principles of joint criminal enterprise can apply to a strict liability offence in this way, an agreement to commit an act which constitutes a crime, and participation in that act by presence during it, need be proved. There is no need to prove an intention to commit that act as a crime in order to establish the offence. 
     
      
      2. Is the charge proved against Mr Petro? 
      
    160 I now need to decide if Mr Petro is criminally liable as charged.Firstly, applying a modification of principle (2) in Tangye as discussed in the preceding paragraph, the Court must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence shows that there was an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between Mr Petro and Mr Lindsay to carry out an act (which did or could give rise to a strict liability offence), namely knocking over a tree or trees over 3m. Secondly, applying a modification of principle (3) in Tangye the Court must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence shows that Mr Petro participated in that act by his presence and encouragement of Mr Lindsay (with knowledge of what acts Mr Lindsay was doing). While some cases concerning joint criminal enterprise for mens rea offences have considered that presence at the commission of the crime is not essential, see for example Gummow and Gaudron JJ in Osland at par 146, that is the basis of the charge before me. 161 The evidence relied on by the Prosecutor for agreement and participation is closely linked in the circumstances of this case.  
     
      
      Evidence and submissions relied on by Prosecutor 
      
    162 The Prosecutor submitted there is no doubt that Mr Lindsay has committed an offence under s 125 of the EP&A Act, that is, a breach of cl 20 of the LEP in that he has removed trees to which the TPO applies without consent or permission or authorisation. Because this is a strict liability offence it is not strictly necessary for the Prosecutor to prove that either Mr Petro or Mr Lindsay knew that trees in excess of 3m were being removed, provided there is evidence that trees of 3m in height were being removed (as there is). I note that the evidence relied on by the Prosecutor extends beyond that referred to in the particulars set out at par 135 above. Those particulars focus on the presence of Mr Petro during Mr Lindsay's clearing activity only. In final submissions the Prosecutor also relied on events before Mr Lindsay commenced work to argue there was agreement between Mr Petro and Mr Lindsay. 
     
      
       
      “Agreement” 
      
    163 The evidence of agreement between Mr Petro and Mr Lindsay is that although Mr Lindsay was introduced to the property by Mr Armitage he knew he was doing the work for Mr Petro. He told Ms Davine he worked for Mr Petro. Mr Armitage called Mr Petro when Mr Lindsay was in the car looking at the property to see the work he was being employed to do. 
     
      
    164 On every occasion that Mr Petro came to the property, which was from the first day Mr Lindsay started work, Mr Petro spoke to Mr Lindsay and told him “good work, keep going”.  Alternatively, to the extent he may not have used the specific words “keep going” he left Mr Lindsay with the impression that he was satisfied with the work that he was doing and that he should keep going. In cross-examination he agreed that he could not remember the precise words used but the impression he had was that Mr Petro said words to the effect that he was doing a good job and should keep going. 
     
      
    165 Mr Petro also provided specific instructions as to the area of property upon which Mr Lindsay was to do his work. He told Mr Lindsay only to clear as far as Logan Crossing Road. Mr Lindsay agreed with the Prosecutor that the work he was doing was “basically just pushing up all the smaller spindly oaks and the younger eucalypt saplings and the undergrowth into piles …”. There is a clear inference from his evidence that Mr Lindsay considered he was told to remove everything other than the larger trees. By the time Mr Lindsay was stopped he had almost finished the extent of the work that Mr Petro had asked him to do. 
     
      
    166 Ms Davine also interviewed Mr Petro, as set out in her affidavit of 13 October 2006. The information she set out includes that Mr Petro is authorised to act for Lawlor Services. Mr Petro organised for someone from the Rural Fire Services to come out to the site. Mr Petro contacted Mr Armitage to have the work carried out. Mr Petro met with Mr Armitage on the site. Mr Petro organised for a Mr Fullford to do some minor works on the property. Mr Petro gave instructions to Mr Fullford for the carrying out of that work. Mr Petro was happy with what was being done on the property. When asked ""what they were doing was to your instructions?"", Mr Petro said ""yes, at the time"". 
     
      
      
      Participation 
      
    167 The evidence the Prosecutor relied on is that Mr Lindsay undertook extensive cleaning up work over approximately 12 days over a large site (minimum 23ha) and that Mr Petro visited on all those days for approximately 20 to 30 minutes. There is evidence from two Council officers, Ms Davine and Mr Hanlon, describing the extent of cleaning up they saw when they visited the site after Mr Lindsay had nearly finished his cleaning up activity.  
     
      
    168 The Prosecutor argued that the inference arises on this circumstantial evidence that Mr Petro could not have failed to notice the scale of the cleaning up process undertaken by Mr Lindsay, given his daily visits to the site. When Mr Petro came to the site Mr Lindsay was working. This can be inferred because Mr Lindsay said that he worked all day without stopping. He stated that when Mr Petro came onto the site he “was only tidying up, doing the general work"". 
     
      
       
      Defendants’ evidence and submissions 
      
    169 The Defendants argued that in order for the Prosecutor to succeed in proving that Mr Petro was engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Lindsay it needs to prove firstly that a crime of the wilful destruction of trees was committed by Mr Lindsay. (I have held that there was such a commission). It is necessary that there be proof of: (i) the existence of a voluntary agreement between Mr Lindsay and Mr Petro for Mr Lindsay to wilfully destroy trees over 3m in height on the property and there is none (if the principles in Tangye/Osland are strictly applied that is correct as identified above at par 158);(ii) the physical presence of Mr Petro at the time and place at which Mr Lindsay wilfully destroyed a tree or trees in excess of 3m; and (iii) the participation (meaning presence in this context) of Mr Petro in the commission of the offence.  
     
      
      “Agreement” 
      
    170 There is no evidence of any agreement between Mr Petro and Mr Lindsay that Mr Petro would agree and participate with Mr Lindsay in the joint criminal activity of the wilful destruction of trees in excess of 3m and none can be inferred on the evidence. There is no evidence that Mr Petro saw Mr Lindsay cut down a tree or trees in excess of 3m. The only person who could have given such evidence is Mr Lindsay and he did not. The Prosecutor contends that notwithstanding that Mr. Lindsay stopped working when he noticed Mr Petro was present, Mr Petro must have known that Mr Lindsay was wilfully destroying trees in excess of 3m in height (in his presence) because of the obvious number of trees in excess of 3m that had been wilfully destroyed. The evidence does not support any such contention, let alone enable the Court to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of such an intermediate fact: see Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 581. 
     
      
    171 The issue of what trees in excess of 3m in height were wilfully destroyed by Mr Lindsay has to be understood in the context of the number of trees, branches and other debris that was on site after logging by Mr Lewis and Mr Toms. According to the Defendants there is no doubt that ground cover and understorey was cleared by Mr Lindsay but how much of this was greater than 3m in height is unknown.172 There is no evidence that Mr Petro knew Mr Lindsay would or had wilfully destroyed trees in excess of 3m or that there was any agreement or understanding between Mr Petro and Mr Lindsay that Mr Lindsay would do so. Mr Lindsay was not told by Mr Petro which trees to clear, that was left up to Mr Lindsay. All the evidence shows is that Mr Petro said to Mr Lindsay “good job”, “keep going” or words to similar effect. The Prosecutor argued that it can be inferred that by these words and his presence there was an agreement, but that is not sufficient to prove the existence of an agreement beyond reasonable doubt. Mr Petro’s comments are entirely consistent with him observing the competent forming of windrows for burning, as instructed by Mr Armitage. The only evidence of a specific instruction by Mr Petro to Mr Lindsay is that he told him to only go as far as Logans Crossing Road.  
     
      
      
      “Presence/participation” 
      
    173 The Defendants argued that the Prosecutor must prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Petro was present when Mr Lindsay wilfully destroyed a tree in excess of 3m, relying on Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573. There is no evidence that Mr Petro was present when Mr Lindsay knocked over a tree over 3m. Further, the evidence is that Mr Lindsay stopped work when he noticed Mr Petro was present. As this is a charge under the TPO of the wilful destruction of a tree the Prosecutor must prove that Mr Petro was present when at least one tree over 3m was knocked over. It is irrelevant that the Prosecutor alleges the offence of the wilful destruction of trees took place over 12 days in the absence of that evidence. Mr Lindsay is unable to say if he did knock over a tree over 3m when Mr Petro was present. The Prosecutor’s case is circumstantial and is insufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Petro must have known Mr Lindsay was wilfully, meaning deliberately, destroying trees over 3m because he saw him do it. 
     
      
       
      Finding on whether Petro liable on evidence 
      
    174 The Prosecutor must prove the elements of the charge beyond reasonable doubt. I have set out at par 159 and 160 the possible elements of a charge based on joint criminal enterprise available for a strict liability offence under s 125(1) of the EP&A Act. The acts constituting the actus reus of the actual offender are attributed to the other party, see McHugh J in Osland at [75]. It is necessary that the Prosecutor prove there is an agreement to carry out the act constituting the crime, that is, the knocking over of a tree or trees over 3m (but not the intention to carry out that act as a crime) and participation by presence and encouragement (including knowledge of relevant acts) at the time of the person carrying out the act constituting the crime (according to Tangye), see par 160. 
     
      
    175 I have set out at length earlier in the judgment the evidence concerning the cleaning up activity by Mr Lindsay, including the obtaining of instructions to undertake the work. There is evidence that Mr Lindsay removed trees in excess of 3m although the evidence of the number of trees removed is imprecise. I have made my finding on various issues based on the evidence above at par 50 -71 and those paragraphs should be notionally repeated here as they inform the arguments and my findings on the issue of whether Mr Petro is criminally liable. 
     
      
      Agreement  
      
    176 The evidence discloses that at the time he was engaged to do the cleaning up work there were general directions given to Mr Lindsay by Mr Armitage based on Mr Armitage’s conversations with Mr Petro. Mr Lindsay’s understanding of what he was asked to do is set out at par 21. There is no evidence of any specific instruction from anyone to Mr Lindsay about how he should undertake the cleaning up in order to heap up the tree heads in windrows for burning. 177 The principal argument put by the Prosecutor is that Mr Petro in arranging via Mr Armitage for Mr Lindsay to do the cleaning up of debris to enable the fire service to burn off, gave rise to the agreement with Mr Lindsay to carry out the act, which was the crime of breaching the TPO by the wilful destruction of trees. This agreement was further confirmed by Mr Petro’s presence on site when the work was being undertaken.178 It is insufficient for this charge based on joint criminal enterprise to rely on the agreement that Mr Lindsay was employed to undertake certain cleaning up work which work resulted in trees over 3m being knocked over as evidence that Mr Petro was agreeing that Mr Lindsay knock down trees over 3m. How the cleaning up activity was carried out was left up to Mr Lindsay. That is confirmed by Mr Lindsay’s evidence outlined above at par 21. He heaped up the heads of trees into windrows in a way he thought the rural fire service would be able to burn. He had extensive experience over 40 years in undertaking that work. He undertook his work carefully and tried not to knock down trees. I do not accept the Prosecutor’s submission that Mr Lindsay considered he was told to remove everything other than the larger trees, as I identified above at par 21. I have held that a large number of trees over 3m were knocked down by him, but these consisted of damaged trees and a substantial number of smaller spindly oaks which were located in amongst many of the heads he had to clear up. 
     
      
    179 Further, Mr Petro did not speak directly to Mr Lindsay before commencing work. An inference open on the evidence is that given the wide discretion Mr Lindsay had to do the job and the fact that he had no direct contact, spoken or in person, with Mr Petro until after he had started work, Mr Petro was unaware of what Mr Lindsay specifically intended to do. Accordingly there could be no agreement that Mr Lindsay carry out the activity of knocking over trees over 3m before Mr Lindsay started work as Mr Petro was unaware that any tree over 3m was likely to be knocked over.  
     
      
    180 Mr Petro came onto the property after Mr Lindsay had commenced work on the first day. Precisely when is unknown. The transcript records that when Mr Lindsay gave evidence he first said that Mr Petro said “good job"" when he saw him on site. When giving later evidence, Mr Lindsay agreed with the Prosecutor that he had said that on the first day he saw Mr Petro, Mr Petro made the comment “good job, keep going”. In cross-examination by Mr Petro’s counsel, Mr Lindsay agreed he could not remember Mr Petro saying to keep going, only that he was doing a good job. 
     
      
    181 Apart from these conversations, there is no evidence that Mr Petro gave any specific instruction to Mr Lindsay telling him how to do the cleaning up activity apart from telling him not to go beyond Logans Crossing Road. That specific instruction does not confirm any agreement to activity which did result in the wilful destruction of trees over 3m by Mr Lindsay. There is also an inference available from the evidence of Mr Petro attending every day and saying “good job”, regardless of whether he said “keep going”, that he was praising Mr Lindsay for the creation of the windrows, as submitted by the Defendants. 
     
      
    182 It also follows that the Prosecutor has not proved beyond reasonable doubt that there was an agreement between Mr Petro and Mr Lindsay before Mr Lindsay commenced work on 17 or 18 July 2006 that Mr Lindsay undertake cleaning up work which included the act of knocking over trees over 3m. Nor do I consider the evidence supports an agreement based on the conversations he had with Mr Lindsay on the property during the period Mr Lindsay was working there. 
     
      
      Participation(and agreement inferred by presence) 
      
    183 In the Prosecutor’s case the evidence of presence by Mr Petro when trees over 3m were being knocked over by Mr Lindsay and consequently his participation, and also agreement inferred by that presence, is circumstantial because there is no evidence that Mr Petro was present when a tree over 3m was knocked over by Mr Lindsay. The Defendant argued that such a finding was an intermediate fact which it was necessary for the Prosecutor to prove beyond reasonable doubt, relying on Shepherd v The Queen in order to succeed. As identified by Dawson J in that case at 579 proof of presence at the crime as an intermediate fact may not always be necessary in order to prove an offence. It may be possible to establish as a matter of inference beyond reasonable doubt from other evidence such as opportunity or motive. It is therefore possible for the Prosecutor to prove participation by Mr Petro if, as the Prosecutor alleges, there is an overwhelming inference that Mr Petro must have been present and aware that trees over 3m were being knocked over despite no evidence that he was present when a tree over 3 m was knocked over by Mr Lindsay. 
     
      
    184 Where reliance is placed on circumstantial evidence the Prosecutor accepted that it bears the onus of negativing any reasonable alternative hypothesis consistent with innocence. The offence of destruction of a tree or trees in breach of the TPO is argued to have occurred over 12 days during which time many trees the subject of the TPO were knocked over. While I have held that it is likely that a large number of trees were knocked over, those consisted of 150 damaged trees which Mr Lindsay considered were dangerous or unlikely to live and numerous spindly oaks, which grew over much of the property on which Mr Lindsay carried out his work, most of which are unlikely to have been much over 3m for reasons stated previously. I have held that the Prosecutor has not proved beyond reasonable doubt how many more trees than in these two categories were knocked over in breach of the TPO (see par 67 -73). 
     
      
    185 The Prosecutor submitted that it must have been obvious to Mr Petro that for the whole twelve days that Mr Lindsay worked trees over 3m were being knocked over, and that that is the only reasonable hypothesis available on the evidence. I have set out above in par 56-62 my conclusions that on the evidence concerning the state of the property after logging in terms of snig tracks and log dump areas being cleared and debris on the ground. Based on that evidence and additional matters considered earlier in the judgment I have made general findings about how many damaged trees and spindly oaks were removed by Mr Lindsay. In the context of clearing of a minimum of 23ha of land after a logging operation across the property I do not consider the inference for which the Prosecutor contends is the only inference open on the evidence. It is also open to conclude by inference on the evidence that it was not obvious to Mr Petro given the state of the property after logging and the nature of Mr Lindsay’s cleaning up activity on the property.  
     
      
    186 An alternative submission not put directly by the Prosecutor is that the circumstances giving rise to agreement (which need not be express, can be inferred and need not arise before the time the crime is committed) and participation occurred at the same time and that this could have occurred at some point or period during the twelve days that Mr Lindsay did the cleaning up work. The particulars of the offence as charged by the Prosecutor is that Mr Petro was agreeing and participating in the acts carried out by Mr Lindsay from the outset of that work. For such an offence to be proved beyond reasonable doubt the Prosecutor would have to identify at what point or period in that twelve days that could be said to have occurred and it has not done so.  
     
      
    187 The circumstantial evidence relied on by the Prosecutor does not prove to the necessary standard that there was participation in the act of knocking down trees over 3m by Mr Petro with Mr Lindsay. As both agreement and participation are necessary elements of the offence of joint criminal enterprise the Prosecutor has not proved that charge against Mr Petro and I consider I should find him not guilty. 
     
      
       
      D. Criminal liability of Lawlor Services Pty Ltd 
      
    188 The Prosecutor submitted that Mr Petro was the heart mind and will of Lawlor Services Pty Ltd relying on Brennan J in Environmental Protection Authority v Caltex (1993) 118 ALR 392 at 416, 417; Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass [1972] AC 153 per Lord Reid at page 170.E; Mosman Municipal Council v Waratah Village Partners Pty Ltd at [17]. The evidence relied on was an interview of Mr Laws, a director of Lawlor Services, with Council officer Ms Davine set out at par 4 of her affidavit dated 13 October 2006 and an interview with Mr Petro identified in par 5 of Ms Davine’s affidavit of 13 October 2006. Consequently it was also liable as charged. The Prosector conceded that if Mr Petro was found not guilty then Lawlor Services Pty Ltd could not be found guilty. 
     
      
    189 As I have found that Mr Petro is not guilty of the charge against him, Lawlor Services Pty Ltd cannot be found guilty of the same charge.

   JUDGMENT1. A question asked by Mr O'Connor raises an issue of admissibility under section 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The question also prompted an application for a discharge of the jury by the Crown Prosecutor. 2. The question asked by Mr O'Connor was asked of the complainant who had been giving evidence of sexual assaults against her by the accused when she was in primary school and a less serious sexual assault, or sexual assaults, when she was in high school. The question asked by Mr O'Connor was that in late 2004, when the complainant was aged about 15, the accused, an elderly relative of the complainant, had made an observation about her appearance. He had said words to the effect: ""You might be pregnant."" Mr O'Connor put to the complainant that the accused had put that question to her. Mr O'Connor added, as part of his question to the complainant “...obviously referring to the fact that you'd put on a bit of weight.” And he then said “Do you remember him saying that?”3. Obviously, an affirmative answer to that question would have constituted evidence disclosing or implying that the complainant may have taken part in some sexual activity, or had sexual experience. 4. Mr O'Connor argued that such an answer would not have breached subsection (3) of section 293 because of the exception contained in subsection (4)(b). However, subsection (5) provides that “a witness must not be asked by or on behalf of an accused person to give evidence that may be admissible under subsection (4) unless the Court has previously decided that the evidence would, if given, be admissible.” The purpose for that provision is made clear by subsection (8) which provides that “the Court, if it decides that the evidence is admissible, must record or cause to be recorded in writing the nature and the scope of the evidence that is admissible and the reasons for that decision.”5. Mr O'Connor did not provide me with an opportunity to make any decision about the admissibility of the question which he said was admissible pursuant to subsection (4). He has apologised for this. I accept his apology. It was clearly an oversight, although a serious one, and, as it turns out, had serious consequences.6. Had Mr O’Connor asked me to give a ruling, I would have ruled, and do so for the purposes of this judgment, that the question did not, as he argued, relate to a relationship between his client and the complainant.7. I can understand Mr O’Connor argument that it so related to a relationship. His argument is that the complainant was resentful of the question and that provided her with a motive for bringing what his client claimed are these false allegations against him.8. But that argument depends upon the word ""relationship"" applying to the relationship between Mr O’Connor’s client and the complainant in this case. They did have a relationship: in one sense it was a family relationship, his client was married to her aunt; in another sense, it was, according to her, a sexual relationship. In any event, I am satisfied that there was a relationship, being one of frequent contact and family. 9. However, to my mind, the relationship in this case is not encompassed by the word in that provision. In accordance with the judgment of Hunt J, as his Honour then was, with whom Wood J, as his Honour then was, and Allen J agreed in Regina v McGarvey (1987) 10 NSWLR 632 at 634, the predecessor to clause (b) in relevantly similar terms was to be construed fairly broadly “...where the evidence is relevant to the issue of the accused's honest belief that the complainant was consenting to intercourse with him.”10. It seems to me that McGarvey is authority for the proposition that the exceptions contained in subsection (4)(a) and (b) are relevant to an accused's belief in consent. Such an issue is not relevant to the charges in this case and the clause does not provide, in my opinion, a relevant exception to the inadmissibility of the evidence if it were to be elicited.11. Had I been provided with the opportunity of giving a ruling in accordance with ss (5), I would have ruled the question inadmissible. 12. This leads to the second issue, which is the Crown Prosecutor's application for a discharge of the jury. His case is that he cannot deal with the question which has now been asked, without himself breaching s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act. I agree with that. He argues that any attempt to remedy the inadmissible question by either Mr O'Connor withdrawing it or by me giving the jury a direction will highlight the question in the jury's minds. The mischief in the question, so far as the jury is concerned, is that it raises for them the issue of whether the complainant, aged about 15 when the alleged proposition was put to her by the accused, was sexually active at the time. Some jurors or all jurors could speculate that were that to be so, even though the complainant has said that he does not recollect the question being asked of her by the accused, then such sexual activity could provide an explanation for her bringing a false accusation against her uncle.13. The difficulty with that form of speculation is this (although it might be an unlikely line of reasoning). There are twelve people in the jury, any one of whom could embark on that line of reasoning and expose it to other members of the jury. It cannot be confronted and dealt with for the reasons which I have already given. The Crown Prosecutor is put at a significant disadvantage in my opinion. 14. He supports his application to discharge the jury with a statement of intention that efforts will be made on behalf of the Crown to rely upon the evidence given in chief and in cross-examination so far by the complainant in a retrial. I should add that the stage had been reached where she had completed her evidence-in-chief and in cross-examination. The issue arose because the Crown Prosecutor raised this before he embarked on his re-examination. The outcome of that proposal by the Crown cannot be guaranteed, but it is a fact which weighs favourably in support of the application. It means it reduces the likelihood of the complainant in this case having to undergo the process of giving evidence extensively once again. If the application is successful, it will be limited to her re-examination.15. Accordingly, I propose to allow the Crown Prosecutor's application and to discharge the jury.

    1 SANTOW JA: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Mark Wilmot, pleaded guilty in the District Court to the following charges: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, an offence under s33 of the  
        Crimes Act  
        which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for twenty-five years and a standard non-parole period of seven years; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent lawful apprehension, an offence under s33B of the Act which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twelve years. 
        
       
      
    3 On the charge of using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent lawful apprehension, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for three years, dating from 7 July 2004. On the charge of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, he was sentenced to imprisonment for eleven years, dating from 7 January 2005, comprising a non-parole period of seven years and a balance of term of four years. The overall sentence, then, was imprisonment for eleven-and-a-half years with an effective non-parole period of seven-and-a-half years. He seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 An agreed statement of facts was tendered in the sentence proceedings. I shall set out the facts as succinctly as possible, drawing upon the summary in the Crown’s written submissions. The victim of the offence of malicious wounding with intent, Marged Mostafa, is the husband of Oumi Mostafa. She was previously married to the applicant, and there are two children of that union. On 5 July 2004, during an access visit to the children, the applicant threatened his daughter with physical harm if she did not tell him where the victim was working. She told him that he worked at the Sydney Olympic Park at Homebush Bay. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was living at the time at his mother’s home at Engadine. On the following day, 6 July 2004, he left the home early, taking with him two pocket knives, a pair of gloves, a ski mask and ski goggles. He drove to the victim’s home at Punchbowl and waited for him to leave. The victim left in his car, accompanied by his wife and the two children, and drove to his place of employment. The applicant followed them. 
     
      
    6 Having arrived there, the victim got out of his car, and the applicant flashed his headlights, alighted from his car and ran towards the victim. He was wearing the ski mask and goggles and held a pocket knife in each hand. He said, “I am going to kill you,” and stabbed the victim a number of times. He then ran back to his car and drove off. 
     
      
    7 The victim suffered a number of stab wounds, to which I shall refer shortly. His wife and other bystanders went to his assistance, and Mrs Mostafa’s daughter told her that she recognised the applicant as the offender. It was this conduct which gave rise to the first charge, maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent.  
     
      
    8 The applicant drove to a location at Terrey Hills, where he buried the knives, gloves, ski mask and goggles in a dry creek bed. He then drove to Palm Beach, where he took off the clothes he was wearing, which were bloodstained, and donned a wet suit. He buried the clothing under a rock, entered the surf and washed any remaining blood from his body. He drove to Avalon, where he bought some fresh clothes, and then returned home.  
     
      
    9 He saw a marked police car on the driveway of the home, and he drove to a nearby park. He was followed there by Highway Patrol police. He got out of his car, brandishing a tomahawk, which he had been carrying in the car for some time. He held the tomahawk above his head in a threatening manner and said to the police, “You’re going to have to shoot me because I’m not going to gaol.” The police could not arrest him because there were a number of members of the public, including children, in the park. They tried to use capsicum spray, but he escaped into an area of the Royal National Park. This behaviour was the basis of the second charge, using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent lawful apprehension. 
     
      
    10 Early in the following morning, 7 July 2004, the applicant presented himself at Engadine Police Station. He was barefoot and complained of being cold. He was attended to by ambulance personnel.  
     
      
    11 He was later interviewed by detectives, having declined the opportunity to seek legal advice, and admitted both offences. He said that the stabbing of Mr Mostafa was premeditated and that he intended to cause serious harm, but not to kill. He admitted having bought the ski mask and goggles a few days before the incident. He confirmed that he waved the tomahawk at the police because he wanted them to shoot him, as he did not want to go to gaol. He denied having any mental problems. He also took police to the location at Palm Beach where he had disposed of his clothes, and attempted to find the place at Terrey Hills where he had buried the knives and other items.  
     
      
    12 Mr Mostafa suffered stab wounds to his chest, one of which punctured his left lung and fractured a rib, as well as stab wounds to both hands and his right leg. He was treated at Bankstown Hospital and discharged on 14 July 2004, a little over a week after the incident. The injuries to his right hand have left him with permanent loss of strength and sensation in that hand. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    13 The applicant was thirty-seven years old at the time of the offences and is now forty. He has no prior convictions. However, when he committed the offences he was subject to an apprehended violence order taken out against him by Mr Mostafa in November of the previous year. He was educated to year ten standard and had a stable employment history.  
     
      
    14 An important issue in the case was the applicant’s mental condition. His parents, who were themselves divorced but had remained on amicable terms, supported him in the sentence proceedings. His mother provided a written statement and his father gave evidence.  
     
      
    15 His father said that, during the course of the applicant’s marriage, he noticed a deterioration of his mental state. After the relationship broke down, the applicant complained to his parents about difficulties with access to the children and his perception that their care and education had been adversely affected since their mother had become involved with Mr Mostafa. By the time in late 2003 when the apprehended violence order was made, Mr Wilmot Snr was expressing concern to his son about his mental state and recommending that he seek help. Unfortunately, the applicant did not see a doctor or seek any other professional advice.  
     
      
    16 However, promptly after his reception into custody following his arrest for these offences, the applicant came to the attention of Justice Health medical staff. Over the following two months, he was diagnosed variously as suffering from paranoid psychosis, paranoid personality disorder and schizophrenia. He was placed on anti-psychotic medication.  
     
      
    17 In October 2004 he was examined for the purpose of these proceedings by the well known forensic psychiatrist, Dr Bruce Westmore. Dr Westmore did not then have the Justice Health records and the applicant was reluctant to speak to him about the offences. At that stage he was unable to diagnose a mental illness and, certainly, could not say that any such illness had played a role in the applicant’s criminal behaviour.  
     
      
    18 However, in the following month Dr Westmore was supplied with the Justice Health records and, it would seem, with some material from the applicant’s father. In a supplementary report, he noted that the Justice Health material disclosed a diagnosis of psychotic illness and expressed the opinion that it was likely that the applicant “was mentally ill at the time of the offending behaviour and it is probable that his mental illness played an immediate or direct role in the offending behaviour.” He also noted that the history from Mr Wilmot Snr of a decline of the applicant’s mental condition over a period of years was “consistent with a mental illness probably of a schizophrenic type”.  
     
      
    19 The sentencing judge took this condition into account as part of the subjective case. His Honour found that the applicant was remorseful, and considered that he was entitled to the “full discount” of twenty-five percent for the utilitarian value of pleas of guilty. He found special circumstances. He noted that the offences were committed in the context of “family relationships”, and concluded that the applicant had a prospect of rehabilitation if those relationships could be “properly adjusted” and he underwent psychiatric treatment.  
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    20 Ms Davenport SC, for the applicant, argued that the sentencing judge erred in his approach to the evidence of the applicant’s mental illness, and in his assessment of the starting point of sentence for the offence of malicious wounding with intent.  
     
      
    21 It is convenient to begin with the second of those arguments, which was put in Ms Davenport’s written submissions but not developed in oral argument. As I have said, the malicious wounding with intent offence carried a maximum sentence of twenty-five years and a standard non-parole period of seven years. His Honour expressed the view that that offence was “a case well above the standard non-parole period and well above mid-range in objective seriousness…”. He then referred to the maximum sentence of twenty-five years and concluded that the offence called for a starting point of twelve-and-a-half years “before discounts for this particular offence”.  
     
      
    22 As I understand Ms Davenport’s written submissions, her complaint is founded upon the assumption that twelve-and-a-half years was his Honour’s starting point for the non-parole period, and that his reference to where the offence stood in a range of objective seriousness was for the purpose of determining what that period should be in the light of the prescribed standard non-parole period. However, as the Crown prosecutor in this Court pointed out, a careful reading of this passage of his Honour’s remarks discloses that he was addressing the appropriate “head” sentence, not the non-parole period. This appears clearly enough from his Honour’s reference to the maximum sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment.  
     
      
    23 Let me turn, then, to his Honour’s approach to the applicant’s mental illness, which was the primary focus of the application. As I have said, his Honour accepted that the applicant suffered from mental illness and took that into account as a subjective factor. However, he did not find that that illness played a role in the applicant’s commission of the offences, notwithstanding Dr Westmore’s opinion that it probably did. He rejected a submission that the applicant should be found not to be fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of his mental state, saying that the manner in which the attack upon Mr Mostafa “was conducted, planned and carried out speaks against that finding”. He later referred to the “calculated manner” in which the applicant “approached his task of stalking Mr Mostafa and then attacking him…”.  
     
      
    24 As to the applicant’s use of an offensive weapon to avoid lawful apprehension, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        … the effect of that mental condition is not readily apparent in much of the activity that occurred on this day, although the reason for his offending is a different matter entirely. But the actual actions he took do not match up with the mental problem that he has been diagnosed with.  
        
       
      
    25 What his Honour meant by the observation that “the reason for his offending is a different matter” is not entirely clear. However, it is apparent from his remarks that he did not accept that the applicant’s mental illness had any bearing upon the commission of either offence. Ms Davenport argued that this was in error and could not be supported, given the view expressed by Dr Westmore in his second report. Accordingly, she said, his Honour had failed to take into account a significant matter when assessing the objective gravity of both offences. 
     
      
    26 It is unnecessary to revisit the familiar line of authority dealing with the bearing of mental illness upon sentence: see, for example, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. Undoubtedly, a finding that the applicant’s mental illness contributed to his criminal behaviour would have been relevant to an assessment of the objective gravity of his offences. However, that is a matter in mitigation as to which the applicant bore the burden of proof, and there needed to be evidence sufficient to establish it. 
     
      
    27 Certainly, there is a bizarre quality to both offences. This can be seen in the somewhat elaborate planning of the malicious wounding of Mr Mostafa and the ferocity of the attack upon him, as well as in the applicant’s expression to police of a preference to be shot rather than be imprisoned. As to the planning of the first offence, it may be that that is not inconsistent with its being the product of mental illness. Moreover, one might question the effectiveness of the applicant’s disguise when committing that offence in the presence of members of his family. As I have said, it did not prevent his daughter recognising him.  
     
      
    28 Nevertheless, a finding that the applicant’s mental illness contributed to the offences would need to have been supported by expert evidence disclosing the basis upon which that finding was available. In his second report Dr Westmore did not elaborate at all upon his assertion of a link between the illness and the applicant’s behaviour. His ability to proffer a basis for that opinion must have been hampered by the fact that the applicant declined to provide him with an account of the offences. Nor did the applicant give evidence in the sentence proceedings, and Ms Davenport was unable to take us to any part of his recorded police interview which might have provided a foundation for the doctor’s opinion.  
     
      
    29 Ms Davenport referred to a passage in the Justice Health material from which it appears that the applicant told a health professional that he believed that Mr Mostafa was planning to sexually abuse his daughter. This appears in notes made on 12 July 2004, five days after his arrest. Nothing of the kind was suggested elsewhere in the evidence. In particular, he said nothing about it in his recorded police interview and there was no reference to it in Dr Westmore’s reports or in his father’s evidence. Nor is it referred to in his Honour’s remarks and, indeed, it does not appear to have been raised at the sentence proceedings. 
     
      
    30 It is difficult to place any weight on this assertion, or to afford any significance to it. There appears to have been no material before his Honour by which it might be decided whether there was some factual basis for it, whether it was a fabrication or whether it was a delusional belief. Certainly, there was no evidence, expert or otherwise, to establish that it was engendered by mental illness.  
     
      
    31 Ms Davenport emphasised the fact that almost immediately after the applicant’s arrest he was found to be suffering from a psychiatric condition, previously undiagnosed and apparently of long standing. She argued that this alone warranted a conclusion that his condition influenced the commission of the offences.  
     
      
    32 I must say that this aspect of the matter has troubled me. However, as I have said, the question of a link between the applicant’s mental illness and his offences was a matter for expert evidence. Whilst acknowledging the undoubted expertise of Dr Westmore, his second report was wholly inadequate to establish that link. The bare assertion of a link, without elaboration, was insufficient: cf Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705. It was open to his Honour to find that the connection had not been established.  
     
      
    33 Accordingly, I consider that neither of the challenges to the sentencing process has been made out. The sentences are severe but the criminality of both offences, particularly the wounding of Mr Mostafa, was of a high order. That offence was aggravated by the fact that the applicant was subject to an apprehended violence order in respect of the same victim: R v Edigarov (2001) 125 A Crim R 551, per Wood CJ at CL at [50(c)]. Given his Honour’s approach in determining the sentence for that offence, summarised above, it is not entirely clear that the applicant received the specified discount of twenty-five percent for his plea of guilty. However, no point was taken about this in the application. Nor was it argued that the sentences are, in any event, manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    34 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

     SENTENCE1. I am sentencing a man with a poor driving record for offences of driving under the influence of alcohol. I am sentencing him for yet another offence of driving under the influence of alcohol. The case comes before me because it is an appeal.2. Trevor John Wilkins was convicted after a hearing in the Local Court at Inverell on 13 August 2007. He had been charged with a number of driving offences, one of which was driving under the influence of alcohol on a road. That is an offence contrary to s 12(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. He was unsuccessful in defending the prosecution and the learned magistrate convicted him.3. He was then sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 months with a non-parole period of 6 months. He was disqualified for holding a licence for the statutory period of 3 years. Mr McCallum, who appears before me for Mr Wilkins on this appeal, asks for either a suspended sentence or a reduced non-parole period. 4. In considering whether to accede to that submission, it is relevant to refer to some of the evidence. Two pieces of evidence are of significance. The first is Mr Wilkins' driving record, and the second are some character references.5. Turning to the driving record first, there was some confusion about the record and indeed, there still is, but the evidence before me demonstrates, I am satisfied, the following. Mr Wilkins has been convicted a number of times in Queensland of driving under the influence of liquor. His earliest convictions for that offence were in the 1980s. His most recent conviction for that offence in Queensland was on 7 December 2005 when he recorded a reading of .153 which, in New South Wales, would be a high range prescribed concentration of alcohol in the blood.6. Before then, the most recent and most significant offence was driving under the influence of liquor in 1993. It is clear, in my opinion, that Mr Wilkins has a poor record for drink driving. In fact, it is worse than poor, it is a bad record for drink driving. It means that it is important for me to take into account so far as the protection of the community is concerned, the need to stop Mr Wilkins from driving in those circumstances.7. The second aspect of the evidence which is of significance, as I have said, are the character references. He is obviously well regarded by people in the community. In particular, he has been helping people on properties in the country. It appears to me that he has been doing this for his board and lodging without charge. One person whom he helped, describes him as: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Helping around the property, repairing machinery, and performing a myriad of farming tasks. He has worked on the tractor for 14 or 15 hours a day. He has maintained the only source of water on this particular property 
        .” 
        
       
      
     This referee, a Mr Justin Sutton, said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Trevor has been at our beck and call for 4 to 5 years now, and never, not once, did he ask for anything in return - but a feed and a bed!” 
        
       
      
    The reference further went on to say that Mr Wilkins had had never once let them down and has been indispensable and an integral part of that particular farming family. They said they owe him a great deal. He is described as an honest and loyal customer of a business. He has been looking after his mother's property since his late father died and has also been helping on a property at Tenterfield.8. What happened in this case which I am sentencing Mr Wilkins for briefly, is this, he was driving a car on the Brunxton Highway at Bonshaw. He was seen to run off the road. I am satisfied that that was caused by a tyre blow out. He was seen by a local grazier who helped him, but who, in the course of helping him noticed that Mr Wilkins was obviously affected by alcohol. Mr Wilkins insisted on getting back behind the wheel. The local grazier followed him. Mr Wilkins was driving with the flat tyre. Sparks from the rim caused a fire to occur in Mr Wilkins' car which forced him to stop.9. I will make these observations about that driving. First, it was irresponsible. The evidence is clearly consistent with him being affected by alcohol. I should add that he did not co-operate with a breath test and blood was not able to be taken at that point because of the unavailability of facilities.10. The second observation is, to adopt a submission made by his counsel, Mr McCallum, that perhaps by good fortune the two incidents which occurred were not brought about by poor driving caused by the alcohol. They were brought about by poor driving caused by bad judgment, but not by the alcohol. 11. Mr Wilkins acknowledges that he has served some period of imprisonment in the past. The extent of his driving record was the subject of an application by the respondent prosecutor to reopen her case. Ms Mudge, who appears for the prosecutor, discovered during the course of submissions that the traffic record before the learned magistrate was different to the one before me. The one before the learned magistrate was worse. It explains what had puzzled me, namely, such a significant sentence for a person with what appeared to be an unremarkable traffic record. The supplementary record became exhibit C.12. In my opinion, Mr Wilkins' driving record leaves me little choice but to sentence him to a period of imprisonment. In my opinion, a period of imprisonment of 7 months is appropriate. Mr Wilkins clearly has a problem with alcohol and driving, and I think it is about time that he took an opportunity to look at it. I regard that circumstance as special circumstances and for that reason, I propose to allow a longer period than the standard period on parole. I propose to fix a non-parole period of 2 months to date from 13 August 2007. I do not propose to exercise my discretion regarding the disqualification, given Mr Wilkins' record.13. Mr Wilkins, I am sentencing you to a period of imprisonment of 7 months. I set a non-parole period of 2 months to date from 13 August 2007 and to expire 12 October 2007. The balance of the term of 5 months is to commence on 13 October 2007 and to expire on 12 March 2008. I direct that you be released to parole on 12 October 2007. I expressly state in accordance with s 51(1AA) that the offender is not to be subject to supervision. The statutory period of disqualification applies from 13 August 2007 until 12 August 2010.

    JUDGMENT1. This is a case where I think the events which the prosecution say occurred probably happened. But it is a criminal prosecution and the probability of the events happening is not sufficient for me to be convinced, of course, beyond reasonable doubt. As Ms Mudge said, who appeared for the Respondent, this is a case where there were two different versions of the events. 2. The two prosecution witnesses were public servants working in a building in Armidale. They had a good view of a park across the road. Their evidence was that they saw a car doing what they described as “doughnuts” in the park. I understand doughnuts are a manoeuvre where a car with a combination of breaking and accelerating spins around on an axis. They observed the car doing this in the park on 16 May 2006. Statements were taken from them at the same time, after they reported it to the police. As Ms Mudge said they were sufficiently concerned with the driving of this car that they reported it to police. 3. Although that does not assist me in determining whether the nature of such driving would be driving in a manner dangerous, I accept Ms Mudge’s submission that performance of the manoeuvre involves a degree of loss in control over the car. If the Appellant in this case, Nicholas Sanders, performed this manoeuvre, his own evidence is that he had a passenger with him. In my opinion that passenger’s safety was in danger by such a manoeuvre and it is correctly described as driving in a manner dangerous. 4. That is a relevant question because Mr Sanders, based upon the statements taken by the two witnesses, was charged with driving in a manner dangerous to the public. That is an offence under s42(2) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. 5. Mr Sanders’ account is that he was working that day in or near the park. He finished at 4.30, he got in his car to go home. He gave a lift to a co-worker, Mr Devlin. There was some difficulty in the traction of the wheels on the ground when he started but he otherwise left the park without incident and certainly without performing any of the manoeuvres which the prosecution witnesses claim they saw.6. The strength in the prosecution case, which makes me think that what they say happened probably happened, is that their statements were taken on or about the same day of the events so that their statements which were tendered in evidence are likely to be a more accurate account. Secondly, they maintained observations of the car throughout the relevant periods, and thirdly, there is some concession by the defence witnesses of some spinning of the wheels. The defence witnesses who acknowledge that, and not all of them, tend to downplay it which makes me suspicious.7. On the other hand, in the defence case the Defendant himself, Mr Nicholas Sanders, gave evidence. He was supported by his passenger, Mr Devlin, and three other persons, Messrs Darcy, Payne and McMillan. Two important observations need to be made about these persons. The first is that most of them met for the first time because they were all working on the same job. Casual labourers were required for this job and at least a number of them had not met before. The second observation is that, on the evidence, a number of them had not had any significant contact since 16 May 2006. They had seen Mr Sanders’ solicitor, Mr Falcomata, who appears for him today, but otherwise had little contact with Mr Sanders or with each other. 8. This is significant because his Honour, in a considered judgment, made findings about the witnesses called by or on behalf of the Defendant. He found them “all to be dutiful and convenient witnesses. They all gave strictly rehearsed evidence in relation to the issue that his driving was not a matter for concern.” Mr Falcomata submits that this is not a finding to which I should attach significant weight. He needs to make that submission because the Court of Appeal has made it clear that I may place weight on findings of a magistrate which depend upon factors available to the magistrate but which are not available to me, such as the demeanour of witnesses. 9. However, I accept Mr Falcomata’s point that the evidence in this case does not enable me to agree with that finding that they gave “dutiful and convenient” evidence which was “strictly rehearsed”. The evidence is of casual workplace acquaintance and little if any acquaintance since the events in question. 10. Whilst I am on his Honour’s reasons, a second reason for his Honour placing less weight on the defence witnesses were inconsistencies in their accounts. Whilst all of them broadly gave evidence to the effect that they observed nothing unusual or unsafe or inappropriate about Mr Sanders’ driving, there were inconsistencies in the accounts they gave about the route taken by Mr Sanders after the driving in question through the park. In this regard I accept Mr Falcomata’s submission that they are inconsistencies which are not surprising given the fact that witnesses giving evidence after some years may well be inconsistent in some detail. I regard the detail in respect of which these inconsistencies arose as not material. In that regard I accept Mr Falcomata’s submission. 11. I will here make some remarks about Ms Mudge’s submissions, which of course I am rejecting in reaching this conclusion. I do not place any weight on the argument that there was a reasonable possibility of a misidentification by the prosecution witnesses. I accept her submission that this was never put to the two prosecution witnesses in the lower court.FALCOMATA: I apologise for interrupting, your Honour. It was put to one of the witnesses, Ms Bashford, at p 35, your Honour. The question is asked “How can you positively say that the vehicle was the vehicle that left the roundabout?” I apologise for interrupting, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Sorry, where’s that?FALCOMATA: P 35 at line 1, at line 2, your Honour. One would have to read that whole page and the next to put that into context.12. I correct what I have just said. In respect of one of the witnesses that proposition was not put and I am not prepared to make a conclusion that there was a misidentification. The proposition was put to the other witness, a Ms Bashford, who confirmed in effect that she had kept the vehicle in her sight for the relevant period. This is another point made by Ms Mudge, that the two prosecution witnesses maintained visual eye contact throughout the relevant period. I accept the strength of this which supports my view that the events probably occurred as deposed by those witnesses. 13. I do have reservations about the fact that the witnesses for the Defendant, another point made by Ms Mudge, had given their evidence quite some time after the events in question. There is some question about how they could recollect that day in particular and that particular piece of driving, unremarkable as it was. However, once again I do not understand that that issue was explored with them by the prosecutor at first instance. There was, as Ms Mudge said, a significant time gap but, as she fairly acknowledged, that point has some significance in a submission put by her to me but was not sufficiently explored by the prosecutor at first instance. 14. Finally, Ms Mudge said I should reject a submission that the magistrate appeared to rely upon a pro forma form of judgment which had been used before. I do reject that submission as to its relevance to this case. As Ms Mudge says, what is important is in the learned magistrate’s reasons rather than whether he may have used a pro forma or not.15. Finally, the learned magistrate rejected the Defendant’s evidence and found that he had been consciously or unconsciously trying to lead the court away from matters that would expose weaknesses in his testimony. I do not share the same view so far as the transcript is concerned and I do not see any other aspect articulated by his Honour which would enable me to say that his Honour was in a better position to make that finding than I am. 16. For the reasons which I have just given I have determined to allow the appeal and in accordance with s20(1)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I set aside the conviction.  Now is there anything else, Ms Mudge, on this case?MUDGE: No, your Honour, sorry your Honour, I’m just--HIS HONOUR: Yes? Mr Falcomata? Sorry, I’ll stay with one person at a time. Sorry, Ms Mudge.MUDGE: I’m sorry, I’m just trying to collect my thoughts in regard--HIS HONOUR: Collect your thoughts, that’s all right.MUDGE: The conviction has been set aside. The magistrate had made further orders in regards to fines and so forth. I’m just wondering if any - all orders that the Local Court magistrate made in relation to this matter just should be quashed. So if the orders could be set aside. That’s the easiest way. HIS HONOUR: All right. 17. I also set aside any consequential orders made by the learned magistrate.  
     
      Mr Falcomata, nothing else? 
    FALCOMATA: In effect, your Honour, I was only going to suggest that your Honour use the terminology or phraseology conviction quashed and orders set aside but in effect your Honour has done that.HIS HONOUR: I’ve got to use the words of the statute. I’m not convinced the last order was in the terms of the statute but it seems to make sense.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      1. Barry James Vale is a young man with a bad criminal record. He comes before me for sentencing for a serious crime. He turned nineteen earlier this year. He is still in custody bail refused in respect of the offence for which I am sentencing him. Because he committed the offence a few months after he turned eighteen he is in adult prison. The question for me in sentencing Mr Vale is whether I should impose a sentence which requires him to remain in custody for longer than today.  
       
       
      2. The charge which he faces is an offence under s112 (2) of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      . The charge - to which he has pleaded guilty - is that on 12 November 2006 at Armidale he broke and entered a dwelling house occupied by Raymond Noon. He did this whilst he was in company with a man named Byron Kelly. Part of the offence is that once they broke and entered the house they committed a serious indictable offence. The indictable offence committed by Mr Kelly was more serious because he assaulted Mr Noon. The indictable offence committed by Mr Vale was larceny. This offence is an aggravated break and enter because it was committed in company. 
       
       
      3. It carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. Parliament has also fixed a five year standard non parole period in respect of this offence.  
       
       
      4. Briefly this is what happened. Mr Vale was drinking with friends. One of the friends was playing the poker machines. He had extraordinary luck and won $6,000. This was paid to him in the form of a cheque for $4,000 plus $2,000 in cash. After buying everyone drinks the man went back home with his friends including Mr Vale. Celebrations continued. The man who had won the money was Raymond Noon. After the celebrations Mr Vale left Mr Noon’s house but before he left he saw where Mr Noon had hidden the remainder of his cash which at that stage had been reduced to some $1,800.  
       
       
      5. After Mr Vale left he ran into Byron Kelly. He and Mr Kelly decided to return to Mr Noon’s house and steal the money. This is exactly what they did. Mr Vale broke and entered the house along with Mr Kelly. Mr Vale showed Mr Kelly where the money was hidden and then Mr Vale left and waited outside down the street. In the meantime back in the house things became more dangerous for Mr Noon. He woke up. Mr Kelly assaulted him and left with the money. He met up with Mr Vale in the street but when Mr Vale asked for his share Mr Kelly assaulted Mr Vale as well and left without providing any money. 
       
       
      6. In assessing the objective gravity of this offence I bear in mind that Parliament regards it, as I said, as so serious that it has affixed a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. That is because it is an aggravated version of this offence. Once again it has also attached as I said a five year non-parole period. The non-parole period in this case remains as a reference point because Mr Vale has pleaded guilty.  
       
       
      7. The offence was aggravated by the fact that it was planned to some extent. I think planned is a better expression than organised. It was an opportunistic offence in terms of perhaps hours rather than minutes. Nevertheless it was planned. 
       
       
      8. Another feature which is aggravating is that Mr Kelly and Mr Vale broke into the house when it was likely that it was occupied by other people. 
       
       
      9. Mr Falcomata who appears for Mr Vale submits that the objective gravity of this particular offence, so far as his client’s participation is concerned, is at the lower end of the scale. I accept that submission. The reason that I accept that submission is that the indictable offence which was committed by Mr Vale was larceny rather than assault. The contrast is seen when one compares the gravity of Mr Vale’s offence with Mr Kelly’s offence. The other reason for accepting the submission is that Mr Vale left the premises as soon as he had completed his task of pointing out where the money was. 
       
       
      10. Turning to Mr Vale’s subjective circumstances I should start by setting out a brief chronology of relevant dates. He was born on 24 April 1988 so that he is presently nineteen. On 4 April 2006 a son was born to him and his partner. On 24 April 2006, just three weeks later, Mr Vale himself became an adult. This offence was committed about six months later as an adult on 12 November 2006. He was arrested on the same day but denied committing the offence. Nevertheless he was kept in custody. A few months later on 8 February 2007 he was interviewed again by the police and admitted his participation in the offence. Not only did he admit his participation but he indicated that he was prepared to give evidence against his co-offender whom he nominated.  
       
       
      11. Turning to factors which are personal to Mr Vale I make the following observations. He gains no credit at all from his criminal record. As I said at the commencement of these reasons he has a bad record. In fact it seems to me that he started to commit offences from the age of about thirteen. His offences include assaults including at least one maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm, larceny and robbery. Most of these, indeed all of these offences were dealt with by various children’s courts. This is the first offence committed by Mr Vale as an adult and the first time that he will be sentenced as an adult. His record indicates a need for me to give particular weight to what the law calls particular deterrence or specific deterrence. In other words Mr Vale has been assaulting people and stealing things for some years now. It is my responsibility, in sentencing him, to bear in mind the need to stop him from committing further offences or at least to deter him from committing further offences.  
       
       
      12. Other factors which are personal to Mr Vale include these. This is his first time in adult prison. Because of the assistance which he has indicated that he is prepared to offer he is serving his sentence in strict protection. He has been in strict protection for some five of the eleven months that he has been in custody. He has already been threatened. The threats include a threat of stabbing. He says he has received a direct threat from Mr Kelly and indirect threats from others. He has been assaulted for his cigarettes.  
       
       
      13. A pre sentence report has been prepared in respect of Mr Vale. It notes that he was affected by alcohol at the time of this particular offence. Indeed it records that he was a regular cannabis user from the age of sixteen. It records that Mr Vale himself regards his alcohol consumption as problematic. It expresses the view that he appears to be easily led in to making foolish choices and not deterred from re-offending despite community supervision orders. He has in the past, I note from his record, had the benefit of community service orders. 
       
       
      14. In his favour he comes from a stable family background and enjoys family support and encouragement so far as making positive choices and employment. 
       
       
      15. I have read an affidavit by Greig Stier from the New South Wales police. It notes that Mr Vale nominated his co-offender Mr Kelly to the police and provided them, that is the police, with a handwritten signed statement as well as an undertaking to give evidence against Mr Kelly. It is noted by the police that Mr Vale has made a material contribution to the prosecution of Mr Kelly. It said that the police investigating this particular offence were otherwise unaware of the involvement of Mr Kelly. It acknowledges that there is a risk to his safety being in corrective services custody with Mr Kelly. Mr Falcomata has drawn my attention to the significance of this assistance under s 23 of the  
      Crimes (Sentence Procedure) Act 1999 
      . I think it has significant weight. The police obviously regard it as significant and useful. They were able to arrest Mr Kelly whom they did not realise was involved in this particular offence. The assistance was given in a relatively timely way, a couple of months after Mr Vale was arrested. He has promised to give evidence in court. He is in harsher custodial conditions as a result of his assistance and indeed has been on the receiving end of threats and assaults. I take these matters into account.  
       
        
       
      16. He has pleaded guilty at what is agreed by Ms Mudge, who appears for the prosecution, to be the earliest available opportunity. He has expressed remorse in the witness box before me. That is also indicated by his early plea and his practical assistance to the police. 
       
       
      17. His prospects of rehabilitation are reasonably good. I say reasonably good rather than good because he has had opportunities in the past which he has not taken. But I say reasonably good rather than guarded or poor because on his evidence and the evidence of his own mother who was called as a witness before me and on whose evidence I place some significance, the birth of his own son has made a difference to him and his maturity. Despite the fact that he committed this offences after the birth of his own son the realisation that he is deprived of the opportunity of seeing his son who must visit him in gaol if it is going to happen has brought about some change in him which his mother has observed. Hence the other reasons that I consider his prospects of rehabilitating himself reasonably good are: his strong family connections; he will be returning to live at home with his parents; his relationship with the mother of his son; and the fact that he has a job which is available to him in his father’s business. 
       
       
      18. I also have taken into account the principles enunciated by the authorities which are known by the reference to the case called  
      Fernando 
      . He is clearly regarded as a reliable and hardworking person. A reference from a person involved in Jobs Australia for whom he worked on a community service order testifies to that. 
       
       
      19. Mr Falcomata submitted that I might consider a non custodial option such as a suspended sentence. I do not regard that as an appropriate option. Because of his poor record and the need for specific deterrence and because of the seriousness of this offence I regard a custodial sentence as necessary. I also accept Ms Mudge’s submission that he does not appear to have learnt lessons in the past. It is for that reason that I do not regard the option of suspending this sentence as appropriate. 
       
       
      20. I therefore propose to sentence him to a period of full time custody and as I said at the beginning of these remarks the question for me is how much longer he should spend, if any time, in custody. I would regard a penalty for an offence such as this in the region of five years as a head sentence as not inappropriate. I would however discount that in this case by a factor of some 25% because Mr Vale has pleaded guilty. Because of his significant assistance to the authorities, involving the risks that he has put himself at, I discount that by a further 25% so that I reach a figure of around two and half years as a head sentence.  
       
       
      21. Taking into account at this stage other subjective factors such as his remorse and prospects of rehabilitation I regard a head sentence of two years as the appropriate sentence to impose in this particular case. As for a non parole period I accept Mr Falcomata’s submission that this is an appropriate case for the parole period to be greater than the statutory ratio. I think there are special circumstances which justify this. The main one is that this is his first time in adult custody. A second reason is that there is a demonstrated need for supervision and assistance with drug and alcohol problems which he has had from an early age. For that reason I propose to exercise my discretion and to alter the ratio.  
       
       
      22. As I indicated to the legal representatives before I embarked upon these remarks on sentence I originally had in mind an overall sentence of two and a half years with a non parole period of fifteen months. That was on the understanding that I could give a direction that Mr Vale would be able to serve the remainder of his non parole period in a juvenile detention centre. However, Ms Mudge has correctly drawn my attention to the fact that because this offence was committed by Mr Vale as an adult I have no power to give that direction. It follows that the custody which he has to serve will have to be continued to be served in an adult facility. I regard this as a significant factor. It affects the exercise of my discretion on special circumstances in that I give greater weight to the question of this being his first time in custody. Not only that but so far as the overall sentence is concerned I give greater weight to the consequences of his assistance which he has given to the authorities. In adult prison he has experienced threats and assaults. I propose to fix a sentence the non-parole period for which will expire today.  
       
       
      Now I have said that. Is there any problem or can I go ahead? 
       
      MUDGE: Can’t foresee any problem. Just in relation to the issue of bail there was some error in paperwork in relation to there was another backup matter in relation to this particular matter which remained in the local court and he has been unconditional bail - has been granted for him in relation to that however it’s not in the records in the registry and that’s where the error’s occurred and is being corrected now. So it’s anticipated he’ll be released once that error’s been corrected. 
       
       
      FALCOMATA: Yes that’s my understanding your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: All right thank you. Would you stand up Mr Vale? 
       
      23. For the offence of aggravated breaking and enter and committing a serious indictable offence I sentence you to imprisonment to a total term of two years. The sentence is to commence on 12 November 2006. I set a non-parole period for the sentence of ten months and twenty-four days commencing 12 November 2006 and expiring today 5 October 2007. The balance of the term will be one year one month and seven days commencing tomorrow 6 October 2007 and expiring on 11 November 2008.  
       
       
      24. I am satisfied for the reasons that I gave in my remarks on sentence that there are special circumstances for the balance of the term of your sentence exceeding one third of the non-parole period for the sentence. 
       
       
      25. Under s50(1) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
       I make an order directing your release on parole today.  
       
       
      26. I make it a condition or your parole that you be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and that you accept their reasonable directions concerning drug and alcohol counselling. It will be a further condition of your parole that you notify the Probation and Parole Service of any change of your residential address. 
       
       Now anything else? 
       
      MUDGE: I would ask that he report as soon as practicable either today if he’s not released earlier enough today by 11 o’clock tomorrow to the Armidale Probation and Parole Service. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Tomorrow is Saturday. Monday? 
       
       
      MUDGE: By Monday, yes. 
       
      27. I further direct that you report to the Armidale office of the Probation and Parole Service by close of business on Monday 8 October 2007.  
       
       Anything else? 
       
      MUDGE: No I think that covers it your Honour. Just an issue’s been raised in regards to him entering into bail— 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: That doesn’t concern me does it? 
       
       
      MUDGE: It’s another matter. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Mr Falcomata anything else? 
       
       
      FALCOMATA: No your Honour. 
       
       
      28. Now Mr Vale you’re lucky in a way: unlucky and lucky. This is the first time you’ve got into trouble as an adult and I hope it’s the last time. You don’t have a good record and it’s time that you made a change. You’ve got your own son now and from what you told me in the witness box and from what your mother said it seems as though that’s made a big impression on you. You don’t want him having you as a role model but he can have you as a role from here on as somebody completely different to what you were before. Now I was going to keep you in gaol for another four months because of the seriousness of what you did but because you’re in adult prison for the first time I think that’s a very significant factor for a nineteen year old and that’s why I am releasing you today. In a sense you’re lucky because I thought that you should stay in for longer but I’m not prepared to keep you in adult prison beyond today. Do you understand that? 
       
       
      OFFENDER: Yes your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: All right. You can be taken away and processed. Thanks Mr Falcomata. 
       
       
      FALCOMATA: Thank you your Honour.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      1. I am sentencing Justin James Martin for the offence of supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis. That is an offence under s25A of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 
       and carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. The drugs to which that particular section apply do not include cannabis and in this case the drugs which were being supplied on an ongoing basis were methylamphetamine. Mr Martin pleaded guilty, it is accepted, at the earliest opportunity. 
       
       
      2. Briefly this is what happened. Mr Martin was identified by the police intelligence as a supplier of amphetamines in the Armidale area. Police set up an operation involving undercover operatives. Those undercover operatives made contact with Mr Martin over a period of some days and he supplied them with drugs on each of the days. 
       
       
      3. On 11 September 2006 he supplied them with .2 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $80. On 12 September 2006 he supplied the same amount of drugs for the same amount of money. On the same day the undercover operative received a text message from Mr Martin indicating that he, Mr Martin, could organise the supply of further methylamphetamine from another source. This time the undercover operatives were supplied with .4 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $100. The next day, 13 September 2006, the amount was increased again. This time the undercover operatives were supplied with 31/2 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $750. The final supply was on 19 September 2006, once again the quantity was increased. The undercover operatives handed Mr Martin $1,300 and in return he supplied them with 7 grams of methylamphetamine.  
       
       
      4. On the same day they indicated that they would pay $2,400 for 14 grams. Some days later a transaction occurred in which that amount of methylamphetamine was supplied in exchange for $2,400. On the day of that supply, which was 26 September 2006, the police terminated the operation and arrested Mr Martin. He made full admissions in his record of interview after his arrest. 
       
       
      5. The offences, I have said, carry a maximum of twenty years. In  
      Regina v Smiroldo 
       (2000) 112 A Crim R 47, Hulme J, with whom Sheller JA and Dowd J agreed, discussed s 25A of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
      ,  
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          It was introduced 
          ”, his Honour said, “ 
          to target dealers who had organised their affairs in such a way as to limit the full effect of the drug legislation by dealing only in small quantities at a time 
          .” 
           
          
         
        
       
      His Honour observed that the Minister said that the quantity of drugs supplied was, so far as s 25A was concerned, immaterial. On the other hand Hulme J pointed out that obviously, in accordance with sentencing principle, the amount or the quantity of the drug should be a relevant factor for sentencing. 
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          It would be relevant to consider 
          ”, his Honour said at [14], “ 
          whether an offender, convicted of an offence under the section had sold three lots of 1 kilogram each or three lots of 1 gram. 
          ” 
          
         
        
       
      His Honour went on to say in the following paragraph 
       
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          The persons at whom s 25A is directed are those who appear to be indulging in a practice or business of supplying prohibited drugs. It must, it seems to me, be relevant to consider the magnitude of such an operation 
          .” 
           
          
         
        
       
      6. In this case the magnitude of the operation was relatively modest. As Mr Falcomata, who appears for Mr Martin, pointed out, the overall quantity of the drugs involved were some 10 grams, that is twice the indictable amount. It was, he pointed out, significantly below the commercial quantity, which is 250 grams. It was, it seems, a relatively small scale street enterprise. In addition it is to be noted that in accordance with the evidence of Mr Martin, whom Mr Falcomata called to give evidence, the remuneration he received for his drug supplying activities was in the form of helping himself to the drug which was supplied, a process referred to as taxing. On the other hand it is clear that Mr Martin was prepared to increase the amounts which he sold in response to the demand of those to whom he was selling it. He did not appear to baulk at the opportunity of increasing the amount sold. 
       
       
      7. Mr Martin, so far as his personal factors are concerned, has pleaded guilty, as I have indicated. Not only that but he has told the police that he is prepared to give evidence against the person supplying him, a man named Shane Young. That person is facing trial and there is, amongst the exhibits, an undertaking by Mr Martin that he will give evidence against Mr Young. He confirmed that, at least in skeletal outline, in cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor. 
       
       
      8. Mr Martin has no record of previous offending for this type of behaviour. His record contains only a couple of traffic matters. He is therefore not in need of a particularly strong degree of personal deterrence, which would be the case for someone with a criminal record which was relevant. 
       
       
      9. There was also tendered in the proceedings a pre-sentence report. It refers to Mr Martin’s history of drug taking, which was confirmed by Mr Martin in his own evidence. In his own evidence he indicated that he had used alcohol and cannabis from a young age. He stopped drinking alcohol after his second traffic conviction. He smoked cannabis for about five years. He was drug free for some years from 2002, but in 2005 commenced to use amphetamines. He became addicted fairly quickly. 
       
       
      10. Whilst I am referring to his evidence, he has a child, a boy named Corey, born on 16 April 2005. The mother of his son has moved to Western Australia. She moved some five months ago because Mr Martin was in prison. It is clear that Mr Martin is attached to his son emotionally and misses the opportunity to see him. Mr Martin assures me that he will remain drug free and will not commit this sort of offence again. Whilst he has been in remand he has seen a counsellor concerning his drug activity and he is going to be or has been assessed for a residential drug rehabilitation facility called The Glen. 
       
       
      11. Returning to the pre-sentence report, it says that he, Mr Martin, 
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          recognises that he will encounter different pressures upon his return to the community, and the environment of a residential rehabilitation facility may allow him to develop strategies which will assist him to remain drug free 
          .” 
           
          
         
        
       
      It noted that he appeared genuine in his expressions of remorse. It offered an opportunity to supervise Mr Martin and to monitor his progress and performance. It assessed him as suitable for both Community Service and Periodic Detention. He has demonstrated his interest in rehabilitation by the courses which he has undertaken in prison, as well as by a previous course which he undertook concerning persons who drive with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in their blood. I note that he ceased drinking alcohol after one of those offences.  
       
       
      12. Mr Falcomata called Ms Cheryl Jones, Mr Martin’s mother. She noticed an improvement in her son since he has been in custody and made it clear that on his release, she will provide a home for him and support his rehabilitation. 
       
       
      13. So the question is what sentence I should impose upon Mr Martin. Mr Falcomata submits that a non parole period in the order of eighteen months would be appropriate, and the Crown Prosecutor does not add anything by way of submissions apart from reminding me to bear in mind the discount and the appropriate stage at which to apply it. 
       
       
      14. This is a serious offence created, as I said, by Parliament to target those who make it a business to sell drugs in the community. That is exactly the business that Mr Martin was engaged in. The fact that he did not derive a benefit in the form of money but instead in the form of drugs for his own use, does not reduce the fact that he was engaged in a business. The fact that he was being paid small amounts in the form of supporting his own drug addiction does reduce the criminality of the behaviour, nevertheless he was prepared to increase the amounts in accordance with demand. 
       
       
      15. Parliament, as I said, has fixed a maximum penalty of some twenty years imprisonment for this sort of offending. Taking into account that the overall amounts supplied by Mr Martin were relatively small and that the business enterprise was relatively small in its scale. In my opinion an appropriate commencing place before discounts for an offence such as this, is less than the halfway figure of ten years, and it seems to me that a figure of eight years overall imprisonment would be an appropriate starting place.  
       
       
      16. However Mr Martin has pleaded guilty and demonstrated remorse and has also indicated that he is prepared to assist the authorities. Mr Falcomata has referred me to s 23 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
        
      and I have taken into account the relevant factors there. In accordance with the authorities it seems to me that an appropriate discount is in the region of forty percent for his combined assistance and the plea of guilty, including remorse. This reduces the overall sentence to something over four and a half years.  
       
       
      17. However I also take into account that his prospects of rehabilitation appear to be quite good. He has demonstrated in the past his capacity for rehabilitation and his prospects on being released from prison are good because of his close and supporting relationship with his mother. In addition he is serving, so far, his custody in protection. That is because of his size, he is a relatively small stature, and his lack of confidence. He will therefore serve his term of imprisonment in somewhat harsher conditions or more deprived conditions than might otherwise have been the case. 
       
       
      18. Taking these various factors into account, I am prepared to further reduce the sentence to just over three years. I have in mind, as the overall penalty, a sentence of forty months. Mr Falcomata invited me to set a parole period which is longer than the normal statutory ratio. There are, I am satisfied, special circumstances which warrant this. In this case his need for supervised rehabilitation would be assisted or promoted by a longer than normal parole period. I am therefore going to set a non parole period of twenty months. The sentences will all date from the date of his arrest, 26 September 2006. 
       
       
      19. So Mr Martin I am going to sentence you to an overall period of three years and four months, that is forty months, commencing 26 September 2006 and concluding on 25 January 2010. I set a non parole period for the sentence, which is the minimum period that you have to be kept in detention, of one year and eight months, that is twenty months, to commence on 26 September 2006 and to expire on 25 May 2010. The balance of the term is also to be one year and eight months, that is twenty months, it will commence on 26 May 2008 and expire on 25 January 2010. The earliest date at which it appears that you will be eligible for release to parole is therefore 25 May 2008. 
       
       
      So I do not make a parole order, do I gentlemen, because it is over three years. 
       
       
      MCPHERSON: Yes that’s right. 
       
      FALCOMATA: Yes your Honour. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: Nor do I fix conditions. I think that is probably all Mr Crown-- 
       
       
      MCPHERSON: Yes your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: --and Mr Falcomata. 
       
       
      FALCOMATA: Yes. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: There’s no other orders I need to make. 
       
       
      FALCOMATA: No your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Mr Martin do you understand you have been sentenced to three years and four months, do you understand that. 
       
       
      OFFENDER: Yeah. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: That is forty months, it all dates from when you were arrested on 26 September last year, half you must serve, the other half on parole, and that is provided the Parole Board releases you. I cannot order that, it is a matter for the Parole Board or the Parole Authority, but you will become eligible to be considered for release on parole on 25 May 2008 and your overall sentence after parole expires 25 January 2010, do you understand that. 
       
       
      OFFENDER: Yeah. 
       
       
       oOo

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      1. Brian Armstrong is before me for sentencing. He committed a serious crime. The crime he committed was contrary to s 112(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      . It is called aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence.  
       
       
      2. The particulars of the charge are that on 17 January 2007 he broke and entered a dwelling house of Charles Kennedy. Then he committed a serious indictable offence, namely assaulting Charles Kennedy and causing him actual bodily harm. This crime was committed in circumstances of aggravation in that Brian Armstrong knew that there was someone in the house at the time that he broke in. Mr Armstrong has pleaded guilty before a magistrate and he confirmed that plea today before me.  
       
       
      3. The first thing is to note and record briefly what happened in this case. On 17 January 2007 Mr Armstrong went to Mr Kennedy’s house in Tenterfield. He went there to collect money that was owing to him. He went with a friend. When they arrived at Mr Kennedy’s house, Mr Armstrong drove in and parked near the garage. He was warned by his companion not to do anything wrong. He did not heed that warning. He got out, went to the back of the house and pulled the screen door open, using enough force to make one of the hinges come away. Mr Armstrong gave evidence before me, and I accept, that the screen door may have been old. But nevertheless he pulled it with sufficient force for one of the hinges to come away. He then walked into the house. He grabbed Mr Kennedy by the shirt and pulled him outside. Mr Kennedy said “ 
      I don’t have any money, all I have is fifty dollars in my bank and that has to last me till next week 
      ”. Mr Armstrong’s response was “ 
      Well fucking get it 
      ”.  
       
       
      4. Mr Armstrong then proceeded to take his debt recovery seriously into his own hands. He hit Mr Kennedy to the back of his head with his fist. Not only that, he used a copper pipe which was lying around. He then hit Mr Kennedy again with the copper pipe, this time under his left ribs and his left side lower back and then his left and right forearm. He then kicked him in the groin. He was about to throw a plastic table at Mr Kennedy when Mr Kennedy extricated himself, got back into the house, picked up an axe and returned with that, which was sufficient to drive Mr Armstrong away.  
       
       
      5. Mr Kennedy called the police who came and saw a bump on the back of his head, a long red mark and bruising under his left ribs and a mark and bruising on his left lower back as well as a thin red mark and a large amount of swelling on the left forearm and red marks on the inside of the right forearm. He was treated by ambulance officers and found to have a haematoma to his right forearm and head and abrasions on his stomach and back. He was taken to Tenterfield Hospital for observation. 
       
       
      6. Mr Armstrong was arrested and said that he had gone to Mr Kennedy’s place for the purpose of speaking with him about a thousand dollars owed to him. Mr Armstrong was bailed on the day of the offence but went back into custody on 15 February 2007 and has been in custody since that date related only to this matter.  
       
       
      7. Mr Armstrong has a criminal record. It discloses first his age. He was born on 2 June 1957 so that he is presently aged 50. Many years ago, in 1979, he has convictions for assault which are sufficiently far in the past to place little weight on them. In 1993 he was convicted of malicious damage and in 1998 of stealing and possessing implements capable of entering a car. These matters were dealt with by Local Courts. He has a record in Queensland which includes offences in each of 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. They include creating a disturbance on licensed premises and obstructing a police officer, wilful destruction of property and, significantly, the 2004 conviction was for threatening violence, discharging a firearm or some other act and wilful damage. He received sixty hours community service from the Queensland District Court sitting at Maroochydore.  
       
       
      8. The injuries which were caused to Mr Kennedy I have noted but in this case Mr Kennedy has provided a victim impact statement. Attached to that is a letter from a psychologist Dr Richard Goddard dated 30 April 2007. Mr Kennedy’s statement is dated 28 May 2007. Mr Kennedy attended these proceedings before me today. He read out his victim impact statement. Because it is on the record I do not propose to reproduce it in full but for the purposes of these remarks I can say that some of the consequences of the attack, in addition to the physical injuries which I have described, include sleep deprivation, nightmares and fear of reprisals. His health is declining, his blood pressure has become destabilised. He is constantly startled, his lifestyle is affected. He no longer plays bowls, he feels uncomfortable going to the cinema, he has a dread of going out at night. He is on a number of medications for his blood pressure and nerves. He says that he would not be able to cope with his life without these medications. He has limited use of his left arm.  
       
       
      9. The report from Dr Goddard notes that he (Dr Goddard) had been treating Mr Kennedy in his attempts to stop smoking. The assault which occurred in January this year by Mr Armstrong brought about a resumption of smoking by Mr Kennedy. Dr Goddard noted that Mr Kennedy consistently appeared more anxious after the attack. He thought that there were some symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder.  
       
       
      10. A Probation and Parole Service report has been tendered. It canvasses merely the options available for sentencing. It assesses Mr Armstrong as unsuitable for both a Community Service Order and a Periodic Detention Order. I should add that I regard either of those sentencing options as too lenient in any event. 
       
       
      11. There is very little subjective material or personal information about Mr Armstrong. There was tendered a letter which became exhibit 1, addressed to Mr Kennedy and the court, expressing Mr Armstrong’s deep sorrow for the stress he has caused. That by itself in my opinion would have carried little weight but Mr Armstrong decided to go into the witness box.  
       
       
      12. In the witness box it is quite clear that Mr Armstrong appreciates the seriousness of the crime which he has committed: he left me in no doubt about that. In addition he apologised for the pain and suffering which he had caused to Mr Kennedy and expressed his deep sorrow for what he had done. I regarded that as a genuine expression of remorse and contrition, particularly since Mr Kennedy was present in court when Mr Armstrong said that. Mr Armstrong also gave evidence about the debt which he said he was owed by Mr Kennedy. In addition he gave some evidence which I regard as irrelevant concerning the background of that debt. I place no weight upon the existence of the debt. At least, the only relevance of the existence of the debt is that it explains Mr Armstrong’s presence at Mr Kennedy’s house and it provides an explanation for his reaction when Mr Kennedy said he did not have the money. Otherwise I do not regard the existence of any debt owed by Mr Kennedy to Mr Armstrong as in any way mitigating Mr Armstrong’s behaviour in attempting to recover the debt. I accept that he did not enter the house armed. The copper pipe which he described as small was lying nearby and he picked it up.  
       
       
      13. This is his first time in gaol. He has spent part of that time in segregation by the Corrective Services Department. He is allocated frequently cells which he occupies with other prisoners who are at risk for one reason or another. Mr Armstrong has the support of his family, a sister and a brother and his sister’s husband. They would have been here today apart from a miscommunication. Mr Armstrong has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.  
       
       
      14. Mr Hegney who appears for Mr Armstrong acknowledges the seriousness of the offence, as indeed his client does, and submits that a sentence in the region of two years with a non parole period of about one year might be in order. For reasons which I will give I do not regard that as an appropriately severe enough sentence. 
       
       
      15. This was a very serious crime. Parliament created the offence and attached a maximum of twenty years imprisonment to it. What Mr Armstrong did was essentially to invade Mr Kennedy’s home and then attack him viciously with a weapon, leaving him not only with physical injuries but significant consequences which are still with him today.  
       
       
      16. So serious does Parliament regard this offence that it has attached a standard non parole period of five years. Strictly that is not applicable because this is a plea of guilty, nevertheless courts are encouraged to use the standard non parole period as a guidepost or as a reference point. The legislation provides that courts must give reasons for departing from the standard non parole period and courts are encouraged to give those reasons even in the event of a plea of guilty. Those reasons should be in accordance with s21A of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      .  
       
       
      17. I propose to depart from the standard non-parole period and to sentence Mr Armstrong to a penalty which will be less than that. The two main reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period are Mr Armstrong’s plea of guilty and what I regard as his genuine expression of remorse made from the witness box. The crime itself also I regard as being slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. This is because Mr Armstrong went to Mr Kennedy’s house in order to collect a debt and reacted very badly when he discovered that he was not going to be paid. He did not go armed but he made use of a weapon or an item as a weapon which was there at the time. To the extent that the home invasion and attack were not planned as such, nor was the use of the weapon contemplated in advance, those factors reduce the severity of the crime to, as I said, a little below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Nevertheless I regard, as I said, the offence itself as very serious. 
       
       
      18. Taking everything into account I regard a head sentence, that is the overall sentence, of five years as an appropriate length. I propose to fix a non parole period of two and a half years. I have taken into account in fixing a non-parole period which is only half of the overall length of the sentence, the fact that this is Mr Armstrong’s first time in custody and that he is serving at least some of that time in segregation. 
       
       
      19. Would you stand up Mr Armstrong. I sentence you to imprisonment for five years to date from today 12 October 2007 and to expire on 11 October 2012 - I apologise, it is backdated. I sentence you to imprisonment for five years to date from when you went into custody for this offence, namely 15 February 2007. That overall five year term will expire on 14 February 2012. I fix a non parole period of two and a half years to date from 15 February 2007 and to expire on 14 August 2009. There will be an additional term or the balance of the term of two and a half years to commence on 15 August 2009 and to expire on 14 February 2012. For the reasons which I have given I regard this case as providing special circumstances for the balance of the term exceeding one-third of the non parole period.

      ROBERT JOHN HALPIN v. DEPARTMENT OF GAMING AND RACING 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      (On application for costs) 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 6 October 2005, the Licensing Court determined that the plaintiff to the present proceedings had contravened the provisions of s.133(2) of the Gaming Machines Act 2001 (the Act). That provision imposed an obligation on a hotelier to ensure that gaming machines on licensed premises maintained by a licensee are connected to an authorised CMS. 
     
      
    2 The plaintiff died in October 2006, the month following judgment being given in this Court on an appeal brought by him pursuant to the provisions of the Act and s.52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. The late Mr Halpin appealed against his conviction and an order for costs made against him in the amount of $12,000 in favour of the prosecutor. 
     
      
    3 The issue determined in the judgment in this Court given on 5 September 2006 was concerned with the statutory concept of “connectivity” within the meaning of s.133(2) of the abovementioned Act. 
     
      
    4 The breach alleged in the Licensing Court was said to have occurred on 15 September 2005. In the judgment on appeal it was determined that the “Piñata Pays” machine was “connected” within the meaning of s.132(1) of the Act. Accordingly, there had been no breach of s.133(2) as alleged by the prosecution. 
     
      
    5 It was submitted that in light of the findings and determination of this Court in the appeal that the conviction against him should be set aside, the order for costs made by the Licensing Court should be set aside and that the defendant (the Department) should pay the costs of the present proceedings. 
     
      
    6 I have had the benefit of written submissions on behalf of the plaintiff dated 5 March 2007 and written submissions on behalf of the defendant dated 13 April 2007. 
     
      
    7 By reason of the death of the plaintiff, the initial question raised by the defendant is whether the appeal has abated in light of his death. The defendant made further submissions in relation to proposed orders, the question as to whether or not a costs order may be made against the defendant in the Supreme Court proceedings and the Licensing Court proceedings and other matters raised in the plaintiff’s submissions. I will, accordingly, deal with each of these issues in turn. 
     
      
       
      Abatement of appeal 
       
      
    8 The plaintiff’s solicitor has advised that he is now instructed by the plaintiff’s estate. No application has yet been made by or on behalf of the estate to be substituted as plaintiff. 
     
      
    9 The defendant has submitted that until such application is made and granted, the estate has no right of appearance in the proceedings. In this respect, reliance was placed upon the decision of the Full Federal Court of Australia in Sen v R (1991) 102 ALR 71. 
     
      
    10 Section 187 of the Act provides that a person who is aggrieved by a decision of the Licensing Court in proceedings under the Act may appeal to the Supreme Court on a question of law. The defendant submitted that the reference to a person “aggrieved” must be construed in the context of the Act and that there is no provision in the Act dealing specifically with the situation, as here, where an appellant dies before formal orders are pronounced. 
     
      
    11 The defendant submitted that the proceedings were, in nature, criminal proceedings and that, in accordance with the common law, criminal proceedings abate on the death of a defendant (or in these proceedings, the plaintiff). Reliance was placed upon Sen (supra) and upon the decision in Regina v Rowe [1955] 1 QB 573; Regina v Jefferies [1969] 1 QB 120 and Re Collins (1973) 41 DLR [3d] 232. 
     
      
    12 Mr H F White of counsel for the defendant, in his submissions, contended that the proceedings in this Court are not civil proceedings and, accordingly, the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules do not apply. He contended that the proceedings were criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    13 In support of the submission, it was observed that the subject offence relates to an offence under s.133 of the Act which provides for a maximum penalty of $11,000. 
     
      
    14 Proceedings for such an offence may be taken before the Licensing Court or a Local Court (s.197(1)) of the Act). 
     
      
    15 It was, accordingly, submitted that proceedings taken before the Licensing Court are, for the purposes of any Act relating to summary proceedings before a Local Court, taken to be summary proceedings before a Local Court: s.197(2) of the Act. 
     
      
    16 Further, the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 relates to proceedings for summary offences before a Local Court and it is said that that Act applies to the subject offence: see s.7 of the latter Act. 
     
      
    17 The Criminal Procedure Act (s.3(1)) provides that “criminal proceedings” means proceedings against a person for an offence (whether summary or indictable), and includes the following:- 
     
      
       
      (a) committal proceedings 
       
       
      (b) proceedings relating to bail 
       
       
      (c) proceedings relating to sentence 
       
       
      (d) proceedings on appeal against conviction or sentence 
       
      
    18 The contrary submission was that the plaintiff submitted that the appeal proceedings are not criminal in nature, having been correctly instituted and pursued in the present Division of this Court. It was contended that they “are distinctive proceedings from those conducted in the Licensing Court …”. Mr Hand, solicitor for the plaintiff, observed that the appeal was brought pursuant to s.187(3) of the Act and that, accordingly, the provisions of Part 6 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 are applicable. In particular, reliance was placed upon the provisions of Part 6 Rule 6.30(1) which provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Proceedings to not abate as a result of a party’s death or bankruptcy if a cause of action in the proceedings survives.” 
        
       
      
    19 In addition, Part 6 Rule 6.30(2) provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) If a cause of action survives, any interest or liability of a party to any proceedings passes from the party to some other person, the court may make such orders as it thinks fit for the joinder, removal or rearrangement of the parties.” 
        
       
      
    20 The plaintiff submitted that these procedural rules apply to the appeal proceedings in this Court. 
     
      
    21 It was further submitted for the plaintiff that the right to prosecute the appeal to the point where orders were “formalised”, and the question of costs (being either the benefit to the plaintiff under a costs order, or the liability on the plaintiff for an existing order), survives and, that the appeal proceedings have not abated as a consequence of the death of the plaintiff. 
     
      
       
      Analysis 
       
      
    22 The proceedings instituted in the Licensing Court were proceedings for a summary offence. The appeal proceedings are proceedings on an appeal against conviction. In the defendant’s submission, both proceedings are “criminal proceedings” and not “civil proceedings” within the meaning of the Civil Procedure Act 2005. 
     
      
    23 The Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides, in Part 5 of that Act, for appeal from a Local Court to the Supreme Court. Section 3(1)(c) defines “Local Court” as including “a Licensing Court constituted under the Liquor Act 1982”. 
     
      
    24 Section 52 deals with appeals as of right. Section 52(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “52(1) Any person who has been convicted or sentenced by a Local Court, otherwise than with respect to an environmental offence, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the conviction or sentence, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone.” 
        
       
      
    25 Section 53 of the latter Act provides for appeals requiring leave of the Supreme Court on a ground that involves a question of fact or a question of mixed fact and law. 
     
      
    26 Part 14, Legal Proceedings and Related Matters, of the Act, Division 1, Appeals and Reviews, contains s.187. Section 187 provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person who is aggrieved by a decision of the Licensing Court in proceedings under this Act may appeal to the Supreme Court on a question of law. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) On the determination of an appeal under subsection (1), the Supreme Court is:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to remit the matter to the Licensing Court with the decision of the Supreme Court, or 
           
           
          (b) to make such other order in relation to the appeal as it thinks fit. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) An appeal under subsection (1) is to be made in accordance with Rules of the Supreme Court.” 
        
       
      
    27 There is no provision in either the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act or in the Act which deals with the circumstance of an appellant dying before formal orders are pronounced or whether the personal representative of the appellant may be substituted. 
     
      
    28 In Managing Director, New South Wales Technical and Further Education Commission v Fines (1993) 32 NSWLR 385, the Court of Appeal was concerned with an appeal under s.54 of the Government and Related Employees Appeal Tribunal Act (1980) from a decision of a chairman of the Tribunal on a question of law which had arisen in the course of an appeal before the Tribunal. The hearing of the appeal to the Tribunal commenced on 25 November 1992 and was adjourned on 23 February 1993 for submissions. The appellant, a teacher, died on 17 December 1992 and the adjourned hearing did not proceed. 
     
      
    29 In that case, Mahoney JA observed that where a party to a proceeding dies after the proceeding has been commenced and before it has ended by a decision, at least two questions are apt to arise:- 
     
      
       
      (a) whether the right which the proceeding has been brought to enforce continues to exist notwithstanding the death; and 
       
       
      (b) (if it does) how the fact of death affects the procedural aspects of the proceeding. 
       
      
    30 In order to determine the defendant’s contention that the proceedings have abated and that, accordingly, there are no proceedings in which any further orders (including costs orders) can be made, it is necessary to refer to the relevant principles concerning the effect of death of a party to incomplete proceedings:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The death of a party may cause the proceedings to abate, in the sense that the proceedings could not continue until reconstituted by the addition of proper parties:  
      Scruby v Hoggan 
       (1954) 55 SR (NSW) 2 at 6. 
       
       
      (b) Abatement of some proceedings can be permanent in the sense that no proper party to permit the continuation of the proceedings can be found:  
      Bogeta v Wales 
       (1977) 1 NSWLR 139 at 144-145. In other words, abatement may be permanent if there is no means of reconstituting the proceedings with proper parties. 
       
       
      (c) The common law distinguished between rights, or causes of action that were transmissible from the deceased to his or her legal personal representative and rights that were not:  
      Kalejas v Minister for Justice & Customs 
       [2001] FCA 1769 at [15]. 
       
       
      (d) The question as to whether or not proceedings instituted pursuant to a right created by statute have abated, must be determined by the statute itself:  
      Kalejas 
       (supra) at [18]. It was there held:- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “… a Parliament that creates a cause of action may ordain as it pleases in relation to the cause of action’s survival on death of a party. And the same principle applies in relation to a statutory entitlement that falls short of constituting a ‘cause of action’ .. or a statutory proceeding.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    31 In Fines (supra), the Court of Appeal held that in the case of a statutory right of appeal to an administrative tribunal, in a disciplinary case, which was capable of affecting a deceased teacher’s financial entitlement, the right was transmissible to his legal personal representative. The teacher having died in that case before the determination of the appeal, Mahoney JA) stated at 388-389:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The question whether statutory rights of this kind are to survive death depends upon the intention of the legislature; there does not appear to be any general or presumptive rule … Although in terms the right granted by him by the Act may be merely a right of appeal, the grant of that right carried with it the substantive rights, to salary, wages or allowances and the like, referred to in the Act …” 
        
       
      
    32 In Fines (supra), Mahoney JA concluded (at 388-389):- 
     
      
       
        
        “I see nothing in the terms of the Act or its purposes which leads to the conclusion that the legislature intended that, by the (accidental) fact of death pending the appeal, the right of a member of the teaching service and his family to have such remuneration should be taken away. An appeal might be pending for a significant time. During that time, he might not be able to derive income. If the legislative intention is to be inferred, it is, I think, that the right to claim the discretionary allowance of this should continue, notwithstanding his death.” 
        
       
      
    33 In Kalejas (supra), the Court (Kenny J) similarly stated that whether or not a cause of action is transmissible is a question of statutory construction. That case concerned proceedings against the deceased for his extradition and in particular further proceedings by him seeking judicial review under s.39B(1) and s.39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) of a decision by the relevant minister. It was held that the rights that he had invoked were not of a transmissible kind. The decisions under review were merely a stage in a statutory process by which it was to be determined whether or not he would be extradited from Australia to Latvia. With his death, the request for extradition, which began the process, necessarily lapsed. Kenny J stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… when the request lapsed, then, for practical purposes at least, so did the administrative processes put in train under the Act in connection with it.” 
        
       
      
    34 Where the death of a party to proceedings occurs following a decision or order which effectively determines the proceedings but in which further orders are outstanding, it will, in my opinion, often be the case that the proceedings have not abated or lapsed. A determination by judgment of the question of law raised in the appeal, which question was fundamental to the issue of the alleged contravention, meant that the aspect of the transmissibility of the statutory right of appeal had been overtaken and had merged in the judgment of 5 September. By that judgment, the conviction below had been wrongly entered. In those circumstances, the proceedings could not and did not abate. I will return to the issue of outstanding orders to give effect to the judgment below. 
     
      
    35 In Healey v Williams (1985) 64 ALR 140, the Federal Court (Bowen CJ) considered the power of a magistrate to make an order in respect of costs in circumstances in which the defendant was discharged in respect of the relevant informations upon which the proceedings were based. At the time of making the order, the magistrate stated that he would give reasons for his decision on 27 March 1985. However, the party against whom proceedings were brought died on 23 March 1985. On 27 March 1985, the magistrate gave his reasons for discharging the deceased and an application for costs was then made by counsel. On 4 April 1985, the magistrate ordered the applicant to pay the deceased’s costs in the sum of $24,000, in default 12 months hard labour. 
     
      
    36 In the course of his decision, Bowen CJ stated (at 142):- 
     
      
       
        
         
        “It does not appear to me that the death of Ms Wall on 23 March terminated the power of the magistrate to complete his order. Her death did not affect the information nor in a practical sense did it render inoperative, as it were, the issue of costs. Ms Wong had, over lengthy proceedings, incurred indebtedness for legal costs. Any indebtedness in this respect would fall upon her estate. Her legal personal representative would have an obvious interest in the making of an order for costs.” 
        
       
      
    37 It was held in that case that s.41A of the Justices Act 1902 (NSW) seemed to contemplate that in the case of any order discharging a defendant as to an information under inquiry in committal proceedings, the magistrate may by that order, adjudge the payment of costs. Bowen CJ stated that once the order discharging the defendant was made and the matter was still before the Justice, there seemed to be nothing in the words of the section to preclude the exercise of his discretion as to costs in the event of the defendant’s death (at 142). 
     
      
    38 Finally, in that case, Bowen CJ stated (at 143):- 
     
      
       
        
        “In the present case, as I have said, if the defendant had died during the committal proceedings  
        before 
         an order discharging her under s.41(6) had been made, the information would have lapsed by reason of the death. No order for costs could then have been made under s.41A. The administrative inquiry or proceedings would have come to an end.”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    39 In the judgment of 5 September, I deferred making orders and permitted the parties the opportunity to make submissions upon the question as to whether or not the consequential order or orders should be made by this Court or whether the matter should be referred back to the Licensing Court. It was evident from the terms of the judgment that, upon the construction of the provisions of the Act, it necessarily followed that the deceased’s conviction had to be set aside. 
     
      
    40 In the present proceedings the judgment given on 5 September 2006 determined the rights of the parties and, as indicated above, those rights were merged in the judgment. The plaintiff’s subsequent death could not, of course, have the effect of impairing in an way that which had already been determined by the judgment. There is no basis, as a matter of statutory construction, for concluding that the death of a party could, in the circumstances of this case, prevent this Court from giving effect to its judgment given before death by making consequential orders. 
     
      
       
      The power and limitation on costs against a public prosecutor 
       
      
    41 This Court has statutory power to award costs. However, the Court’s discretionary power to order costs against a public prosecutor on an appeal brought under Part 5 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 is circumscribed by s.70(1) of that Act. 
     
      
    42 The provisions of s.70(1) are in the same terms as former s.81(4) and s.41A(2A) of the Justices Act 1902 (considered in Fosse v DPP [1999] NSWSC 367 and the provisions of s.117 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (committal proceedings) and s.214 of that Act (summary proceedings). 
     
      
    43 The onus is upon the plaintiff to bring the case within an exception to the general rule laid down by s.70(1) that costs are not to be awarded in favour of a defendant to proceedings by way of appeal under Part 5. 
     
      
    44 Section 70 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides for a prohibition on the award of costs in favour of an appellant whose conviction is set aside unless the appeal court is satisfied of the matters specified in s.70(1)(a), (b), (c) or (d). Those provisions are in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        70(1) Costs are not to be awarded in favour of an appellant whose conviction is set aside unless the appeal court is satisfied:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner or 
           
           
          (b) that the proceedings in the Local Court were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith, or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner, or 
           
           
          (c) that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter: 
           
           
            
            (i) that the prosecutor was or ought reasonably to have been aware of,  
             
             
            (ii) that suggested that the appellant might not be guilty of or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award costs in favour of the appellant.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    45 Before turning to the facts relied upon in support of the application for costs, it is appropriate to begin by dealing with the proper construction to be placed upon these provisions. 
     
      
       
      (a) That the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner 
       
      
    46 This provision, like that in s.70(1)(c), is concerned with investigations and not proceedings. The provision is directed to determining whether the investigation into an alleged offence was conducted “… in an unreasonable or improper manner”. 
     
      
    47 This provision, accordingly, requires the plaintiff to establish that the investigation into the alleged offence under s.132 of the Act was such as to fall within s.70(1)(a).  
     
      
    48 The failure of proceedings does not of itself mean that the proceedings fall within s.70(1)(a) on question of costs arises. In Regina v Moore; ex parte Federated Miscellaneous Workers’ Union of Australia (1978) 140 CLR 470, (proceedings involving an unsuccessful challenge to the capacity of an industrial union to create an industrial dispute by service of a log of claims) Gibbs J (with whose reasons and conclusions Barwick CJ agreed) stated:- 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The respondent … has applied for costs on the ground that the proceeding was instituted by the prosecutor ‘without reasonable cause’ within the meaning of s.197A of the Act. In my opinion a party cannot be said to have commenced a proceeding ""without reasonable cause"", within the meaning of that section, simply because his argument proves unsuccessful.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    49 In general terms, the expression “unreasonable or improper manner” embraces the notion of the conduct of investigations in a way or by a method or a mode of procedure that grossly falls below the relevant standards applicable to the relevant type or class of investigation. In JD v DPP [2002] NSWSC 1092, a matter arising out of committal proceedings involving the alleged sexual abuse of young children, there had been a failure by police to conduct certain interviews of very young children according to established protocols which the Court determined had adversely effected the quality of police interviews. Hidden J, however, observed:- 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “I find it somewhat difficult to see that anything done by the police was unreasonable or improper as these words are commonly accepted to mean. The fact that an investigation does not come up to optimum expectations  
          would not put it into a category of being unreasonable or improper unless it was grossly below optimum standards and I cannot say that that is the case here 
          .” 
           (emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
      
    50 It is necessary to state in summary form the facts referred to in the judgment in the present case concerning the lack of “connectivity” in the “Piñata Pays” gaming machine, the subject of the alleged offence:- 
     
      
       
      (a) It is clear from the evidence and concessions made that the technical problem that gave rise to  
      “connectivity” 
       problems was in the faulty GMIC, which it was conceded was part of the authorised CMS (see paragraph [42] of the principal judgment). 
       
       
      (b) By reason of that problem, there had been an absence of transmission of required information from the  
      “Piñata Pays”  
      machine for the period 31 May 2004 and 16 September 2004. 
       
       
      (c) As early as 19 July 2004, a Venue Support Officer from DMS contacted the plaintiff and advised that the machine in question was not transferring data. 
       
       
      (d) On 30 July 2004, Mr Fitzgerald received documentation from DMS which indicated that the plaintiff continued to operate a gaming machine that had not been connected to the CMS since 31 May 2004. 
       
       
      (e) For reasons not explained, it was not until 15 September 2004 that Mr Fitzgerald made contact with the plaintiff and attended the premises on that day in the company of Special Inspector Simon Munt. 
       
       
      (f) The fault was located by the technician in the GMIC and not in the gaming machine. Once the fault was rectified, there was  
      “100% connectivity” 
       (Annexure C to Mr Webb’s statement, 6 June 2005). 
       
       
      (g) The evidence established, at least as a matter of inference, that there had been transmission of information to the GMIC but that the faulty GMIC prevented the transmission from it to the controller. 
       
      
    51 The effect of the interpretation of the provisions in s.132(1) and s.133(2) of the Act discussed in the judgment of 5 September 2006 was that the obligation imposed upon the hotelier to ensure the GMIC was properly passing on information to the CMS had been, on the proper interpretation of those provisions, fulfilled. On that interpretation, the hotelier could not be responsible for the CMS or any part it (including the faulty GMIC). 
     
      
    52 Accordingly, it was a relevant fact that the GMIC was part of the CMS. The statutory obligation of the hotelier (the plaintiff) did not extend to the operational capacity or integrity of the GMIC which was not his “domain” or in his sphere of operation. 
     
      
    53 The prosecution of the plaintiff, based upon the investigations carried out by Mr Fitzgerald, it may be reasonably inferred, failed to analyse the evidence in terms of the location and nature of the technical fault and to then assess the significance of that fact in light of the statutory provisions imposing obligations on hoteliers such as the plaintiff. The defendant Department appears to have proceeded upon the basis that there was an all encompassing obligation upon the plaintiff by reason of a very broad understanding or interpretation of the relevant provisions which, upon analysis, I determined was incorrect. 
     
      
    54 The appeal in these proceedings, accordingly, was successful by reason of a more restricted interpretation of those provisions and an application of them when so understood to the particular facts concerning the location of the fault in the GMIC. Although this involved partly a question of law (more particular of statutory construction), it also involved questions of fact, in particular, concerning the GMIC and the fault within it and its responsibility for the lack of “connectivity”. 
     
      
    55 I do not, however, consider that the defendant’s failure to fully analyse the facts and then apply a more limited interpretation of the relevant provisions could be said to render the investigation as one conducted “in an unreasonable or improper manner” as those expressions have been interpreted and applied in the relevant case law. The reasons stated below in relation to (b) applies equally here. 
     
      
       
      (b) The proceedings in the Local Court were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith, or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner 
       
      
    56 The evidence does not establish that the defendant acted in bad faith. The evidence does not, in my view, support an inference of improper purpose. Nor is there any evidence that the proceedings were conducted by the defendant as prosecutor in an improper manner within the meaning of s.70(1)(b). 
     
      
    57 Further, I do not consider that it can be said that the proceedings were “initiated without reasonable cause”. In Council of Kangan Batman Institute of Technology and Further Education v Australian Industrial Relations Commission (2006) 156 FCR 275, the Full Court of the Federal Court at [60] stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The question therefore arises whether … the plaintiff instituted the proceeding vexatiously or without reasonable cause. A party does not institute proceedings without reasonable cause merely because that party fails in the argument put to the Court:  
        Regina v Moore 
        ;  
        ;  
        ex parte Federated Miscellaneous Workers’ Union of Australia 
         (1978) 140 CLR 470 per Gibbs J at 473. The section reflects a policy of protecting a party instituting proceedings from liability for costs, but that protection may be lost. Although costs will rarely be awarded under the section, and exceptional circumstances are required to justify the making of such an order … a proceeding will be instituted without reasonable cause if it has no real prospects of success, or was doomed to failure:  
        Kanan v Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union 
         (1992) 43 IR 257 per Wilcox J; see also  
        Bostik (Australia) Pty Limited v Gorgevski (No 2) 
         (1992) 36 FCR 439;  
        Nilsen v Loyal Orange Trust  
        (1997) 67 IR 180.” 
        
       
      
    58 The question as to whether at the time the proceeding was instituted it had “no real prospects of success or was doomed to failure” is a question that is required to be determined as a matter of objective fact: Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union v Nestle Australia Limited (2005) 146 IR 379 at [4] citing Spotless Services Australia Limited v Marsh SDP [2004] FCA FC 155 at [13]. 
     
      
    59 The Full Court in Kangan (supra) at [63] stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “[i]t is a matter of judgment, sometimes of fine judgment, in all the circumstances of a particular case whether a proceeding is brought without reasonable cause. The phrase ‘vexatiously or without reasonable cause’ was described by von Doussa J in  
        Hatchett v Bowater Tutt Industries Pty Limited (No 2) 
         (1999) 28 FCR 324 at 327 as ‘similar to the one applied by a Court on an application for the exercise of summary power to stay or strike out proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    60 In Canceri v Taylor (1994) 123 ALR 667, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia determined an application for costs by assessing whether or not at the time of instituting proceedings upon the facts apparent to the informant, there was no substantial prospect of success. The Court, per Moore J at 676, adopted the approach of Wilcox J in Kanan v Australian Postal & Telecommunications Union (1992) 43 IR 257 at 264:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that one way of testing whether a proceeding is instituted ‘without reasonable cause’ is to ask whether, upon the facts apparent to the applicant at the time of instituting the proceeding, there was no substantial prospect of success. If success depends upon the resolution in the applicant's favour of one or more arguable points of law, it is inappropriate to stigmatise the proceeding as being ‘without reasonable cause’. But where, on the applicant's own version of the facts, it is clear that the proceeding must fail, it may properly be said that the proceeding lacks reasonable cause.” 
        
       
      
    61 I do not consider in the present matter that it can be said that proceedings were doomed to failure or had no real prospects of success. The outcome of many proceedings turns upon the Court in question establishing the proper construction of statutory provisions and then applying them as so interpreted to the facts of a particular case. The fact that the defendant pursued the proceedings upon the basis of a broad interpretation of the legislation which was ultimately held to be incorrect, does not satisfy the requisite test in s.70(1)(b). 
     
      
       
      (c) Prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter 
       
      
    62 In the present case, it could be said that the defendant failed to have sufficient regard to the fact that the fault which prevented “connectivity” was a fault in the GMIC and further that the GMIC formed a component part of the CMS and that had it done so the decision to prosecute would not have been made. 
     
      
    63 Accordingly, the relevant issue arising under s.70(1)(c) in the present proceedings, in my opinion, is whether or not it could be said that the defendant, as prosecutor, “was or ought reasonably to have been aware of” those facts and that “… the proceedings should not have been brought”. 
     
      
    64 It is apparent from what has earlier been stated that the prosecution proceedings did not arise merely upon a set of facts which either did or did exist and constitute a contravention of the relevant provisions of the Act. The matter was not as straightforward for it involved a question of statutory construction as well as an assessment of factual matters. In those circumstances, and by reason of the fact that the question of statutory construction was a central issue, I do not consider that it can be said that the prosecutor has unreasonably failed to investigate a relevant matter within the meaning of s.70(1)(c) or that even if there was some failure to fully investigate a factual issue that the prosecution was still not arguable whatever the facts. 
     
      
       
      (d) Because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award costs  
       
      
    65 The expression “exceptional circumstances” is a broad one. Without it being necessary to define its outer limits, the question essentially is whether or not there was any relevant conduct by the prosecutor which would make it “just and reasonable” to award costs in favour of the plaintiff. 
     
      
    66 In Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd v Maritime Services Board of NSW (1995) 36 NSWLR 552; 78 A Crim R 368, the Court of Criminal Appeal determined that the requirement that an order be “just and reasonable” involves both a fair hearing and that the terms of the order finally made are reasonable, per Sully J at 561:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…the words of the section require that an order for the payment of costs pursuant to s.52 of the [Land and Environment Court Act 1979] must be both just and reasonable. The order must be just in terms of the way in which it has been reached; and it must be reasonable in its actual terms.” 
        
       
      
    67 There is no specific conduct identified in the submissions on behalf of the plaintiff which it is said would of itself constitute a basis for activating this provision. Furthermore, I do not consider that there are any particular facts or matters concerning the conduct of the proceedings by the Department which would attract those provisions. 
     
      
    68 Accordingly, I have concluded that the restrictions under s.70 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act on the power of the Court to order costs leads to the conclusions that the plaintiff is not entitled to an order for the payment of its costs by the defendant to the proceedings in this Court. 
     
      
       
      Procedural matters 
      
    69 Finally, the remaining question is whether or not there is a requirement for the proceedings to be amended so as to substitute the executor or administrator of the plaintiff’s estate before the Court may make any orders in the proceedings. The defendant submitted that the estate had no right of appearance in the proceedings unless it formally applied and is granted leave to appear. 
     
      
    70 I have previously set out the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act which, by virtue of s.3(1) defines criminal proceedings as including proceedings on appeal against conviction, which, in my opinion effectively embraces the statutory appeal in the present proceedings. Accordingly, provisions concerning the substitution of parties under the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules are not applicable. 
     
      
    71 However, I do not consider that it is necessary for the plaintiff’s executor or administrator to be substituted before the Court can make the consequential orders to give effect to the judgment of 5 September. This is not a case in which it is necessary for there to be a substituted party following death of a party to carry on proceedings, it having been determined that the conviction was wrongly entered. In those circumstances, the Court is in a not dissimilar position to the magistrate in Healey v Williams (supra) who was found to be entitled to enter consequential orders following upon the primary order discharging the deceased party. This is particularly so in circumstances in which I have determined that there should be no benefit conferred by way of a costs order under s.70 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act and that the only orders to be made to give effect to the judgment are orders setting aside the conviction and setting aside the order made by the Local Court for costs in favour of the prosecutor. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    72 In the written submissions for the defendant dated 13 April 2007, the issue of orders was addressed. Subject to the issue of abatement, it was correctly stated that in view of the judgment made on 5 September 2006, it is appropriate that the conviction recorded by the Licensing Court be set aside and that such an order would not be inconsistent with the provisions of s.55 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act or s.187 of the Gaming Machines Act. I accordingly make orders as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The conviction entered by the Licensing Court on 6 October 2005 against the plaintiff be set aside. 
       
       
      (b) The order made by the Licensing Court against the plaintiff for costs in the amount of $12,000 be set aside. 
       
       
      (c) The plaintiff’s application for costs of the proceedings in the Licensing Court and in this Court is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      Non publication order. The court has made the following orders: 
       
      1. That there be no publication of the name of the respondent or of any material that would identify him. 
       
      2. That the name of the victim and any material apt to identify the victim not be published. 
       
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against sentences imposed upon the respondent in the District Court. The Director submits that the sentences are manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    2 On 5 March 2007 the respondent pleaded guilty to the following charges: 
     
      
       
      (a) On 13 July 2005 at Tregear he had sexual intercourse with DA without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that immediately after the offence actual bodily harm was inflicted on her, contrary to the provisions of s 61J(1) of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900, the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 20 years, and the standard non-parole period is 10 years; and 
       
       
      (b) On 13 July 2005 at Tregear he attempted to choke DA with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely to have sexual intercourse with her without her consent, contrary to the provisions of s 37 of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 25 years. 
       
      
    3 The respondent further asked that the judge, when sentencing for the second offence (attempting to choke) take into account, pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, a further offence, namely that on 13 July 2005 at Mt Druitt he committed an act of indecency towards DA. 
     
      
    4 The respondent was sentenced in relation to each offence to concurrent terms of imprisonment for 8 years comprising a non-parole of 5 years and 6 months commencing on 8 August 2005 and expiring on 7 February 2011 and a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 8 February 2011 and expiring on 7 August 2013. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    5 The respondent is the stepfather of the victim. The victim’s mother was pregnant with the victim when she started a relationship with the respondent. The victim was born on 19 May 1988 and was seventeen at the time of these offences. 
     
      
    6 The respondent and the victim’s mother have five children of their relationship, the youngest of whom was a baby at the time of these offences. The relationship between the respondent and the victim’s mother was volatile. Both used illegal drugs. The respondent told Dr Allnutt, a psychiatrist, that they regularly had fights about money and drugs and that his partner regularly “kicked him out of the house, but that he would return.” One such argument occurred a matter of days before these offences during which the respondent was struck on the head by a clock. The victim called the police, as she had done on occasions in the past and the respondent left the family home. He was sleeping on the streets where he was ingesting large quantities of drugs, which was his usual habit. He told police that in the period leading up to these offences he ingested more than his usual quantity. 
     
      
    7 He told police that he was attending doctors to obtain prescriptions for Panadeine Forte. He told Dr Allnutt that he was taking up to 100 tablets per day. 
     
      
    8 On Wednesday, 13 July 2005 the victim and her mother took the baby to a friend’s house so that the respondent could see him. They left the baby with the respondent and went elsewhere. When they returned the respondent was there with the baby. The victim and her mother started drinking Jim Beam. Thereafter the respondent lured the victim to a nearby reserve on the pretext of collecting stolen jewellery or gold. The respondent asked the victim why she had called the police at the time of the earlier domestic incident. Shortly thereafter the victim told the respondent that she was not going any further. The respondent then produced a tea towel and a roll of electrical tape and tried to force the tea towel into the victim’s mouth. The victim tried to call triple 0 on her mobile but the respondent threw it away. The victim struggled with the respondent while he tried to gag her and she then grabbed the tape and threw it away. During the struggle the victim asked the respondent “why are you doing it?” and he replied “to teach your mum a lesson” and said something about payback for calling the cops. He also threatened to kill her. 
     
      
    9 While the victim was on the ground the respondent had his knees on either side of her legs, the respondent then put his finger into the victim’s vagina. While this was happening the victim was crying and the respondent told her to shut up. Immediately after this, the victim yelled for help and the respondent punched her at least three times in the face. This constitutes the first charge. 
     
      
    10 While the respondent had his finger in the victim’s vagina he took his penis out and started masturbating. This constitutes the matter on the Form 1. 
     
      
    11 The respondent then attempted to get on top of the victim and she put her hands over her vagina. The respondent then tried to put his penis into her vagina and she yelled for help. The respondent then grabbed her by the throat with both hands and started choking her, she could not breathe. She tried to kick him and punch him. The victim then lost consciousness. This constitutes the second charge. 
     
      
    12 When the victim woke up she was lying underneath a pile of sticks and small branches. She pulled herself out from underneath the pile, took her jumper off and tied it round her waist as she was naked from the waist down. She walked to a nearby house where she arrived at about 10.15pm. The residents of the house opened the door and the victim said “I think he raped me, he knocked me out.” The police and ambulance were immediately called. The victim’s face was badly swollen. She was taken to Nepean District Hospital where she was treated for severe soft tissue swelling to her face and scratches and bruises to her body. 
     
      
    13 The respondent returned to the family home after these offences and spoke to his partner. She noticed that he was sweating. He told her that he was going to get fuel and would be back in ten minutes and that he was also going to get some cannabis. He did not return to the house. The police arrived shortly thereafter and his partner contacted him. He refused to return home to speak to the police, stating “I’m going to keep running until they put a bullet in me.” He later refused to go to the police station when contacted by police on his mobile. He went to a friend’s house and told him that he had choked and punched “a bloke” and that he thought he had killed somebody and left them at the reserve. His friend refused to let the respondent stay. 
     
      
    14 The respondent was arrested on 8 August 2005 at Toronto near Newcastle. He told police that he had been staying on the streets and went to his parents’ house for a couple of days. He said that he tried to kill himself a couple of times. He participated in an electronically recorded interview on 20 October 2005, during which he made a number of admissions although he also said that he did not recollect much of what was put to him. 
     
      
    15 He did tell police that he thought he had punched the victim. He told them that he remembered that he was “going to assault her, but I just couldn’t do it, not, not do it.” He remembered choking the victim and then told the police “then I just, sort of like come out of something, I don’t know what it was.” He denied planning the incident and told police he could not remember many of the facts, including the use of the tea towel, the tape, the threats to kill the victim and his family, pulling off the victim’s clothing, putting his finger in her vagina, masturbating or piling sticks upon her. He denied having thoughts about committing the crimes before they occurred. He said “oh, just on the night I think something, something happened just on the night. I don’t, I’m not sure, it’s really vivid and I don’t and it was just on the night, there was no plan to it.” 
     
      
       
      The remarks of the sentencing judge 
       
      
    16 The sentencing judge found that the attack on the victim was “an horrific and brutal attack.” Although there was no evidence of any long term physical consequences for the victim her Honour found there was a “significant psychological or psychiatric impact upon her as identified by her in her poignant statement.” 
     
      
    17 Her Honour found that the respondent was at the time of sentence 38 years of age. He attended school to age 16 and had experienced no learning difficulties. He was the second eldest of four children. He had been disappointed in his parents. He had worked mainly in landscaping jobs and although he had not been fired, he had worked with a variety of employers. 
     
      
    18 The respondent left home at aged 12 or 13 and resided with a known drug user. His drug problems had increased although his parents had no idea of his addiction. When he was about 19 or 20 he commenced a relationship with the victim’s mother. That relationship has now come to an end although he still has contact with his former partner when he telephones his children. 
     
      
    19 In relation to his drug use he told Dr Allnutt that his drugs of choice were initially amphetamines and alcohol commencing at about age 12. He said that at about age 25 he was prescribed Codeine for the first time for a back problem and became addicted. He was initially using about five 30 milligram tablets per day which increased until at the time of the offence he was using a hundred 30 milligram tablets per day or even more. At the age of 34 he began using cannabis daily. He also added Valium to his drug “cocktail” from time to time. 
     
      
    20 He told Dr Allnutt that for some time before the offence he would hear voices when on drugs. The voices would occur when he was either high, coming down or if he had not slept for a few nights. He also said that he had paranoid thoughts and felt that people around him wanted to do him harm. He could not remember whether he was hearing voices at the time of the offences although he did recall feeling paranoid at that time. 
     
      
    21 The sentencing judge found that although not a mitigating factor there was little doubt: 
     
      
       
        
        “that the offender, at the time he committed these offences, was suffering from a very significant degree of drug intoxication and was experiencing at least some of the psychotic phenomena described by Dr Allnutt. I am also satisfied that his capacity to reason was very much affected and that he did not fully appreciate what he was doing. His severe drug intoxication is relevant to the objective, my assessment of the objective seriousness of these offences, as it is relevant to his state of mind. As I have said though, the fact that he was a drug addict does not provide any justification for the commission of these offences. It does provide some explanation.” 
        
       
      
    22 Her Honour found that the respondent’s behaviour since being taken into custody was satisfactory. He had completed courses relating to drug and alcohol abuse and had participated in individual counselling sessions with a psychologist.  
     
      
    23 The Crown submitted that her Honour should be mindful of a number of aggravating factors. The respondent was in a position of trust in respect of his victim (s 21A(2)(k)) and the offence was part of a planned criminal activity (s 21A(2)(n)). Her Honour accepted these aggravating factors although she found that the respondent’s severe intoxication diminished his capacity to have planned the events. The Crown submitted that the respondent was motivated by a desire for revenge or retribution on his partner. In relation to this submission her Honour found “it is difficult, given the gross intoxication, to be satisfied that he cold-heartedly and clearly intended his actions to be in the nature of revenge and I do not propose to treat that as an aggravating factor.” Her Honour also found that “the incidents involved a significant degree of violence and threats of violence which is also an aggravating matter.” 
     
      
    24 In relation to matters in mitigation her Honour accepted that the respondent was remorseful and had good prospects of rehabilitation. Her Honour found that the respondent pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity which entitled him to a discount of 25%. Although her Honour acknowledged that it was possible that the respondent may experience greater hardship in custody than other offenders she did not find herself able to give the fact he will serve his sentence on protection very much weight. Her Honour also found that there were special circumstances in that “the offender needs considerable supervision on his release into the community.” 
     
      
    25 After referring to these various matters her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Taking all of those matters into account and coming to the view that the objective criminality of both offences was in the mid-range of seriousness and acknowledging that I must impose a sentence appropriate to the criminality of the offences. In my view both offences are of equal seriousness, although for different reasons and warrant the same sentence.” 
        
       
      
    26 Her Honour then proceeded to impose the sentences to which I have referred. Her Honour provided for complete concurrency and said “as (the offences) were committed as part of a single episode of criminality and considering Pearce principles of totality the sentences should be served together.” When expressing her conclusion her Honour made no reference to the fact that the 61J(2)(a) offence carried a maximum term of 20 years imprisonment whereas the s 37 offence carries a maximum term of 25 years. The s 61J offence also has a standard non-parole period of 10 years. Her Honour made no reference to the offence relating to the act of indecency. 
     
      
    27 After her Honour had passed sentence counsel reminded her of the standard non-parole period in relation to the s 61J offence and her Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I’m sorry I did not, thank you Mr Crown, I did not refer to  
        Way 
        . The reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period which attached to the first count on the indictment that because this matter arose following a guilty plea, rather than a trial the standard non-parole period acts as a guide post or a reference point and although I found the objective criminality to be around mid-range, in my view because of the matters to which I have referred, including the subjective matters and the mitigating factors that a sentence of less than the standard non-parole period is appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    28 In this later statement her Honour speaks of the objective criminality “to be around mid-range” whereas in her primary reasons she said that the objective criminality of both offences “was in the mid-range of seriousness.”  
     
      
       
      Crown submissions on the appeal 
       
      
    29 The Crown submitted that the offences committed by the respondent were of great gravity. He lured his victim, who was his step-daughter and to whom he had a position of trust and authority, to a reserve, under a pretence, and taking with him a tea towel which he attempted to force into her mouth and a roll of electrical tape, threatened to kill her and while she was protesting and crying had sexual intercourse with her. He grabbed her by the throat and choked her until she lost consciousness and then covered her body and left her semi-naked in the reserve. The Crown submitted that the respondent’s statement that he was committing the offence in order to teach the victim’s mother a lesson and as “pay back for calling the cops” indicated that he was motivated by an irrational desire for revenge and retribution. Furthermore, the offences were planned. It was submitted that in all the circumstances a significantly greater penalty than that which her Honour imposed was required.  
     
      
    30 It was submitted that her Honour had given too much weight to the respondent’s subjective circumstances and failed to impose sentences that properly reflected the objective seriousness of the offences. It was further submitted that her Honour had failed to impose an additional penalty in relation to the matter to be taken into account under the provisions of s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    31 In relation to the s 61J(1) offence it was submitted that her Honour had found that the offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness and that having regard to the fact of the respondent’s motive for the offence, that involved a significant degree of violence with very serious consequences for the victim her Honour should have found that it was an offence above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for such offences. 
     
      
    32 It was further submitted that by imposing wholly concurrent sentences for both offences her Honour failed to mark out the seriousness of each offence and failed to sentence in accordance with the principles in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. 
     
      
       
      The respondent’s submissions 
       
      
    33 The respondent submitted that the sentencing judge by referring to the standard non-parole period and making a finding that the objective criminality was “around the mid-range” adequately considered the standard non-parole period in relation to the first charge. It was submitted that the Crown submission that the respondent was motivated by revenge or retribution was expressly rejected by her Honour. Her Honour determined that the respondent’s gross intoxication precluded a finding that a motive of revenge should be treated as an aggravating factor. It was submitted that it was open to her Honour to depart from the standard non-parole period due to the early plea of guilty. It was further submitted that her Honour was entitled to reach this conclusion having regard to the significant intoxication of the respondent which affected his capacity to reason and diminished his self control. 
     
      
    34 The respondent accepted that the offences involved a degree of planning but submitted that it was open to her Honour to find that the respondent was not aware of the extreme violence that could result from the ingestion of the cocktail of drugs. The respondent emphasised that although he had a criminal history it did not include any convictions for sexual assault and did not contain an extensive history of violence. 
     
      
    35 The respondent submitted that the respondent’s drug addiction was a significant factor mitigating the seriousness of the offences. It was submitted that it was consistent with the decision of this Court in R v XY (2007) NSWCCA 72 that her Honour should find that the respondent’s intoxication was, to some extent, a mitigating circumstance. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    36 The principles which this Court will apply in relation to a Crown appeal against sentence are well known. They are referred in MD, BM, NA, JT, [2005] NSWCCA 342; 156 A Crim R 372 at [18]: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court has, on many occasions, taken care to emphasise the principles governing appeals by the Crown. They were clearly defined by Wood CJ at CL in  
        R v Wall  
        [2002] NSWCCA 42 where his Honour said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘… it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
          House v The King  
          (1936) 55 CLR 449, applies to crown appeals against sentence:  
          Dinsdale v The Queen  
          (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion as to the appropriate sentence, for that of a sentencing judge:  
          Lowndes v The Queen  
          (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error or latent or patent is shown;  
          R v Tait  
          (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388;  
          Wong & Leung v The Queen  
          (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
          Malvaso v The Queen  
          (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere;  
          R v Baker  
          [2001] NSWCCA 85. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle “for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons” per Barwick CJ in  
          Griffiths v The Queen  
          (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
          Everett v The Queen  
          (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
          Dinsdale v The Queen  
          (2000) 202 CLR 32, at para 61 and 62, and  
          Wong & Leung v The Queen  
          at para 109. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
          R v Allpass  
          (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
          R v Papazis  
          (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
          Wong & Leung v The Queen  
          at para 110. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less from that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
          R v Holder & Johnston  
          (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
          Dinsdale v The Queen  
          para 62.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Wood CJ at CL referred to  
        R v Baker  
        [2000] NSWCCA 85 where Spigelman CJ said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The authorities make it clear that Crown appeals should be rare. It may be that the present practice does not reflect that restriction, nevertheless, successful Crown appeals should be rare. This is particularly so with respect to that category of appeals in which no particular error can be identified and the sentencing process and the Crown must rely on an assertion of manifest inadequacy as a basis for a conclusion that some error of principle must have occurred.’ 
          
         
        
       
      
    37 Notwithstanding the care which must be taken before this Court will intervene in response to a Crown appeal, in the present case I am satisfied that there are a number of significant problems with the sentences her Honour imposed which require the intervention of this Court and the resentencing of the respondent. 
     
      
       
      The s 61J offence and the standard non-parole period 
       
      
    38 As I have indicated her Honour initially made the finding that both offences were in the mid range of seriousness although she later said that the objective criminality of the s 61J(2)(a) offence was “around mid range.” The need for a judge to express a finding in relation to the seriousness of the offence was emphasised by this Court in R v Witchard [2007] NSWCCA 167 at [32] and R v Oloitoa [2007] NSWCCA 177 at [28], [41]. Not only must a sentencing judge be careful in the making of that finding it is essential that the remarks on sentence clearly state the reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period before sentence is pronounced in the particular case. When, as in the present case, they are expressed as after thoughts the impression that they were not carefully identified before the appropriate sentence was determined may prove irresistible. 
     
      
    39 The circumstances of the first charge were of considerable gravity. As the Crown emphasised the respondent lured his step-daughter, in relation to whom he had a position of trust and authority to a reserve. He made preparations for the purpose of committing a sexual assault and in so doing inflicted violence upon her. To my mind, a finding that the offence fell above the mid-range of objective seriousness could not have been successfully challenged. However, I am not persuaded that her Honour’s finding that the offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness was not open. 
     
      
    40 However, apart from the fact of the respondent’s guilty plea I can see no justification in a further reduction in the non-parole period by reason of circumstances personal to the respondent. It may be accepted that he has encountered serious problems with drug and alcohol and that he was affected by drugs at the time of the offence. However, the respondent has a criminal history which, although it does not involve offences of a sexual nature, does include two offences involving violence. He has served a custodial sentence for a robbery committed a number of years ago. More recently in 2003 he was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment for inflicting actual bodily harm upon his partner, although the sentence was suspended. 
     
      
    41 In these circumstances, to my mind, the fact that the respondent was affected by drugs at the time of the offence could not justify mitigation of the appropriate sentence. He had taken drugs on many occasions and was aware of their potential impact upon him, including apparent psychotic episodes. There is no suggestion that in committing the subject offence he was affected so that his actions should be seen as “a sudden departure from his previous law abiding conduct.” (R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459) 
     
      
    42 To my mind, even bearing in mind the respondent’s guilty plea, the sentence of a non-parole period of 5½ years with an overall term of 8 years was excessively lenient. 
     
      
       
      Section 37 offence 
       
      
    43 My observations in relation to the relevance of the respondent’s drug taking, both generally and at the time of the offence are also relevant to the second charge. The s 37 offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years. Although her Honour refers to the maximum she nowhere considers what, if any, consequence it may have for the appropriate penalty in relation to this particular offence. There will be varying degrees of criminality in an offence contrary to s 37. In the present case the choking inflicted upon the victim was of such severity that she was rendered unconscious, the respondent believing that she had died. As a consequence of the harm inflicted the victim has suffered significant psychological injury. It must be remembered that the offence itself is defined as an “attempt to choke.” When that attempt results in the victim becoming unconscious the offence is one of considerable gravity. The maximum penalty provided by the statute is 25 years. To my mind the offence justified a sentence of greater severity than the sentence for the s 61J(2)(a) offence. Furthermore, it was entirely inappropriate to provide concurrent sentences for both offences. The initial physical assault and act of intercourse was very serious. However, the subsequent attempted choking of the victim which rendered her unconscious was of a different character and required an identifiable penalty. 
     
      
       
      Section 61N(2) offence 
       
      
    44 This offence carries a maximum penalty of 18 months imprisonment. In accordance with the principles in Attorney-General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 the sentencing judge was obliged to impose an additional penalty when sentencing for the s 37 offence. The failure to do so has contributed to the inadequacy of the sentence requiring the intervention of this Court. 
     
      
       
      The appropriate sentences 
       
      
    45 It is unnecessary for me to repeat the objective circumstances of each offence and subjective matters relevant to the respondent. As I have indicated I would not disturb her Honour’s finding that the offence contrary to s 61J(2)(a) was an offence in the mid-range of seriousness. The respondent is entitled to a discount of 25% for his early plea. Her Honour found that the respondent was remorseful and had good prospects of rehabilitation. Her Honour also found special circumstances and it has not been suggested that this finding was in error. The sentences which I propose fall, as they must with respect to a Crown appeal at the bottom of the available range. If sentenced at first instance they would have been significantly greater. 
     
      
    46 In my view the following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
      1. Uphold the Crown appeal and quash the sentences imposed on the respondent on 23 March 2007 in the District Court. 
       
      2. For count 1 on the indictment the offence of aggravated sexual assault without consent the respondent is sentenced to a fixed term of 6 years commencing on 8 August 2005 and expiring on 7 August 2011. 
       
      3. For count 2 on the indictment (and taking into account the matter on the Form 1) the respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of 8 years commencing on 8 August 2006 and expiring on 7 August 2014 with a further term of 3 years commencing on 8 August 2014 and expiring on 7 August 2017. 
       
      4. The overall sentence is a non-parole period of 9 years with a total term of 12 years. 
       
      
    47 BARR J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    48 BERGIN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: This matter concerns questions submitted to this Court pursuant to s.5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 by a document in the following terms signed by Zahra DCJ: 
     
      
       
        
        1. On 21 May 2007 I heard and upheld an appeal against a conviction by a magistrate of Philip Bates, (Bates), for an offence under s 8C(1)(a) of the  
        Taxation Administration Act  
        1953 (Cth). The terms of the charge of which Bates had been convicted by the magistrate were as follows:  
         
          
          On or about 7 June 2005 at Sydney in New South Wales pursuant to paragraph 8C(1)(a) of the Taxation Administration Act, 1953 you failed to furnish an approved form to the Commissioner of Taxation when and as required pursuant to a taxation law, namely section 162 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.  
          
         
         
        2. I have been requested by the Crown to submit the following questions to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to section 5B of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act  
        1912: 
         
          
          A. Did I err in determining that a notice issued under s 162 of the  
          Income Tax Assessment Act  
          1936 requiring that a nominated income tax return be given to the Commissioner of Taxation by a nominated date, required the taxpayer named in the notice to do one of two things, either give the nominated income tax return to the Commissioner of Taxation by the nominated date, or seek an extension of the time nominated in the notice?  
           
           
          B. Did I err in determining that as Bates, through his tax agent, had requested an extension of time for the lodgement of the nominated income tax return shortly after the receipt of the notice under section 162 of the  
          Income Tax Assessment Act,  
          there was evidence before me that the notice had been complied with, and consequently no offence had been committed under s 8C(1)(a) of the  
          Taxation Administration Act  
          1953 (Cth)?  
          
         
        
       
       
      STATUTORY PROVISIONS 
      
    2 Section 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        5B Case stated from District Court 
         
        (1) A Judge of the District Court may submit any question of law arising on any appeal to the District Court in its criminal and special jurisdiction coming before the Judge to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination, and the Court of Criminal Appeal may make any such order or give any such direction to the District Court as it thinks fit. 
         
        (2) At the request of a person who was a party to appeal proceedings referred to in subsection (1), a question of law may be submitted under that subsection to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination even though the appeal proceedings during which the question arose have been disposed of. The question of law must be submitted not later than 28 days after the end of the appeal proceedings, or within such longer period as the Court of Criminal Appeal may allow. 
         
        (3) The Court of Criminal Appeal may, in connection with the determination of a question of law in the circumstances referred to in subsection (2), quash any acquittal, conviction or sentence of the District Court on the appeal to the District Court. 
        
       
      
    3 The case also requires reference to provisions of the Commonwealth Taxation Legislation, namely s.162 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, and s.8C (as it was at the relevant time) and par.388-55 of Schedule 1 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953: 
     
      
       
        
        162 Further returns and information  
         
        A person must, if required by the Commissioner, whether before or after the end of the year of income, give the Commissioner, within the time required and in the approved form:  
         
        (a) a return or a further or fuller return for a year of income or a specified period, whether or not the person has given the Commissioner a return for the same period; or 
         
        (b) any information, statement or document about the person's financial affairs.  
         
         
        8C Failure to comply with requirements under taxation law  
         
        (1) A person who refuses or fails, when and as required under or pursuant to a taxation law to do so: 
         
        (a) to furnish an approved form or any information to the Commissioner or another person; or  
         
        (aa) to give information to the Commissioner in the manner in which it is required under a taxation law to be given; or  
         
        (b) to lodge an instrument with the Commissioner or another person for assessment; or  
         
        (c) to cause an instrument to be duly stamped; or  
         
        (d) to notify the Commissioner or another person of a matter or thing; or  
         
        (e) to produce a book, paper, record or other document to the Commissioner or another person; or  
         
        (f) to attend before the Commissioner or another person; or  
         
        (g) to apply for registration or cancellation of registration under the  
        A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 
        ; or  
         
        (h) to comply with a requirement under subsection 45A(2) of the  
        Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000 
        ;  
         
          
          is guilty of an offence. 
          
         
        (1A) An offence under subsection (1) is an offence of absolute liability. 
         
        (1B) Subsection (1) does not apply to the extent that the person is not capable of complying with the relevant paragraph. 
         
        (2) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(a) and (d), a person shall not be taken to have refused or failed to furnish information to the Commissioner or another person, or to notify the Commissioner or another person of a matter or thing, merely because the person has refused or failed to quote the person's tax file number to the Commissioner or other person.  
         
         
        388-55 Commissioner may defer time for lodgment 
         
        (1) The Commissioner may defer the time within which an approved form is required to be given to the Commissioner or to another entity. 
         
        (2) A deferral under subsection (1) does not defer the time for payment of any amount to the Commissioner. 
        
       
      
    4 The reference to “absolute liability” in s.8C(1A) engages s.6.2 of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth); and the evidential burden in relation to s.8C(1B) engages s.13.3 of the Criminal Code: 
     
      
       
        
        6.2 Absolute liability  
         
        (1) If a law that creates an offence provides that the offence is an offence of absolute liability:  
         
          
          (a) there are no fault elements for any of the physical elements of the offence; and 
           
          (b) the defence of mistake of fact under section 9.2 is unavailable. 
          
         
        (2) If a law that creates an offence provides that absolute liability applies to a particular physical element of the offence:  
         
          
          (a) there are no fault elements for that physical element; and 
           
          (b) the defence of mistake of fact under section 9.2 is unavailable in relation to that physical element. 
          
         
        (3) The existence of absolute liability does not make any other defence unavailable.  
         
         
        13.3 Evidential burden of proof - defence  
         
        (1) Subject to section 13.4, a burden of proof that a law imposes on a defendant is an evidential burden only.  
         
        (2) A defendant who wishes to deny criminal responsibility by relying on a provision of Part 2.3 (other than section 7.3) bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter.  
         
        (3) A defendant who wishes to rely on any exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification provided by the law creating an offence bears an evidential burden in relation to that matter. The exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification need not accompany the description of the offence.  
         
        (4) The defendant no longer bears the evidential burden in relation to a matter if evidence sufficient to discharge the burden is adduced by the prosecution or by the court.  
         
        (5) The question whether an evidential burden has been discharged is one of law.  
         
        (6) In this Code:  
         
          
          evidential burden 
          , in relation to a matter, means the burden of adducing or pointing to evidence that suggests a reasonable possibility that the matter exists or does not exist. 
          
         
        
       
       
      CIRCUMSTANCES 
      
    5 On 4 October 2006, Magistrate Reiss in the Local Court convicted Mr. Bates of an offence under s.8C(1)(a) of the Taxation Administration Act and imposed a fine of $450.00 plus court costs and witness expenses.  
     
      
    6 The evidence before him showed that a document in the following terms was served on Mr. Bates at his address for service provided to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO): 
     
      
       
        
        Final notice to lodge income tax returns 
         
         
        Our records show that we have not received your income tax returns for the periods  
         
        1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003  
         
        1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004.  
         
         
        Under section 162 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, as delegate of the Commissioner, I now require you to give the Commissioner of Taxation the income tax returns referred to above by 6 June 2005.  
         
         
        The returns must:  
         
        “ give a full statement of total income from all sources in and out of Australia, and  
         
        ” be in the approved form, signed by you or your authorised agent.  
         
         
        If posting the returns, please address them to:  
         
        PO Box 4071  
         
        HURSTVILLE NSW 2220 
         
         
        Court fines may be imposed  
         
        If you ignore this notice, you may be prosecuted and convicted of a criminal offence. If you are convicted, a court may fine you up to $2,200 for a first offence and up to $4,400 for a second offence. For any further offences you may be fined up to $5,500 or imprisoned for a period of up to 12 months, or both.  
         
         
        Penalties may apply  
         
        If prosecution action is not instituted, penalties for failing to lodge 
          
        on (illegible) may apply to late and unlodged income tax returns for the 2000 01 (sic) (illegible) year and subsequent years. Penalties range from $110 to $550 depending on the size of the entity and can increase depending on how long the document is overdue.  
         
         
        Shane Reardon  
         
        Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and  
         
        Delegate of the Commissioner of Taxation  
        
       
      
    7 Mr. Rose, the tax agent for Mr. Bates, gave evidence that he received this notice on 12 May 2005, that on that day he telephoned the ATO and left a message on the answering machine requesting that someone telephone him in relation to Mr. Bates and that no response was received. He also gave evidence that on 12 May 2005 he wrote the following letter to the ATO: 
     
     Taxpayer: Mr Philip Bates 
      
     Tax File Number: 126 087 585 
      
     Extension of time to Lodge Income Tax Returns 
    We confirm we act as taxagents (sic) for the abovementioned taxpayer Mr Philip Bates.We refer to your letter dated 7th May 2005 regarding the final notice to lodge income tax returns for our client in relation to financial years ended 30 June 2003 & 30 June 2004.Our client understands the importance of lodging tax returns however will have difficulty in complying with the lodgement due date of 6th June 2005.To allow our client adequate time to lodge accurate income tax returns we request an extension of time to 30 June 2005 to lodge the abovementioned income tax returns.Should you have any further questions please contact me immediately on (02) 9981 9361. 
     
      
       
      He gave evidence that there was no response received to that letter prior to 6 June 2005. 
       
      
    8 The return for the 2003/2004 year was not lodged until 7 November 2005, and it was the failure in respect of this return that was the subject of the charge. The return for 2002/2003 was lodged on 7 July 2005, also outside the time limited, but this was not the subject of the charge. 
     
      
    9 There was evidence that Mr. Rose advised Mr. Bates on or about 12 May 2005 that he had left a message or messages with the ATO in order to seek an extension of time, and Mr. Bates gave evidence that he contacted his bookkeeper and commenced action to comply with the notice. 
     
      
    10 There was also evidence before the Magistrate of the ATO’s taxpayer’s charter, to the effect that, if a taxpayer writes to the ATO not using its automated reply services, it would aim to provide its response within 28 days of receiving all necessary information, and if all the information was not provided, it would aim to contact the taxpayer within 14 days to ask for it.  
     
      
    11 The Magistrate relevantly gave the following reasons for finding the offence proved: 
     
      
       
        
        Certainly it is submitted on behalf of Mr Bates that ATO is a big organisation; there were references to their charter. No doubt if they had received that letter which on the balance of evidence I am prepared to accept that that letter was sent to an address which was not an inappropriate address and that something appears to have gone awry. There is no record of that letter having been received and it appears to have gone astray within Australia Post or within the ATO. These things of course can happen, they should not happen but that appears on the face 
          
        of it what happened: a not perhaps unexpected action for mail to perhaps go astray in Australia Post or the ATO hence obviously the need where there is a fairly strict and clear obligation upon a taxpayer, (1) to have returned annual returns at an appropriate date which had not been met but (2) and in particular when a final notice is issued that there must be follow up action of a very specific and clear and definite manner to ensure that any request is received and is being acted upon and that follow up action should occur clearly and properly within the notice period. Clearly the 6 June deadline has passed without any follow up action by Mr Bates or Mr Rose of the relevant kind and without any confirmation of such action, the presumption that something may be happening is a far from sufficient response by Mr Bates or Mr Rose.  
         
         
        Whilst if the ATO had received the letter there certainly is an obligation for them to respond to it within a reasonable and prompt timeframe there is no case law or statutory provision that suggests that should the Australian Tax Office be unreasonable in its dealings with a taxpayer in that regard that somehow alleviates or removes any responsibility the taxpayer has in relation to complying with the final notice. Certainly the cases referred to on behalf of Mr Bates make reference to implying aspects of reasonableness in terms of timeframes for such matters. There is certainly nothing in those cases or any case referred to on behalf of Mr Bates that talks about a general obligation to the Tax Department to behave reasonably in such circumstances. Certainly one expects that charter to be adhered to as indeed the ATO witnesses indicated that it would be reasonable to do so but there is no statutory provision or case law that in any way supports that such unreasonable action provides a defence to a matter of this kind.  
         
         
        The statutory scheme, again it is a defence of absolute liability, it places a very heavy burden upon the recipient of the notice not upon the ATO. The ATO certainly has to discharge its onus beyond reasonable doubt, in discharging that onus it does not have to establish that it is beyond reasonable doubt that it has acted fairly in every dealing with the taxpayer or recipient of that notice.  
         
         
        Whilst there is a slight suggestion, very slight indeed, from the letter, exhibit 15, that there might be some difficulty in complying with the obligation by 6 June there was no clear or specific evidence from Mr Bates or Mr Rose or from Mr Bates' bookkeeper that there was some significant or real difficulty in complying with the notice. The evidence tended to suggest that there was no real great complication, certainly matters had to be dealt with chronologically and 2003 returns needed to be brought up to date, BAS statements needed to be done but there was no evidence suggesting any great complexity or timeframes involved in so doing. It is two returns in what on the face of it appears to be no complex tax circumstances for Mr Bates; certainly no specific evidence as to a complicated and difficult tax scenario. He was dealing with a significant amount of work. It is a much different circumstance to that in Ganke where the Court was dealing with a large number of annual returns, quite a number of years six or seven I believe were involved there. Evidence suggested some complexities with the circumstances of the taxpayer in that matter.  
         
         
        I am satisfied that on the evidence before the Court it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that the timeframe that I have referred to that gave the deadline of 6 June for those two returns was reasonable in the circumstances. There is certainly no indication of any real impedient that Mr Bates had in complying with that obligation, certainly he is not entitled, even though there is not clear evidence to that effect, he is not entitled to simply delegate his responsibilities and hope that those matters are dealt with promptly by his bookkeeper or tax agent, the obligation was on him to carry out action. It seems that very minimal efforts were made by him during the relevant period to ensure that that obligation was made. There does not appear to be any issue of a mistake of fact which has caused an error but in any event ... (not transcribable) ... does not make such matter available to him even if there were such facts before the Court. 
        
       
      
    12 In allowing the appeal and quashing the conviction, the primary judge relevantly gave the following reasons: 
     
      
       
        
        Simply put, as the crown has helpfully noted in written submissions, that there are four elements that need to be proved in order to make out an offence under s.8C. They are, firstly, that the ATO had issued a final notice requiring the defendant to lodge a relevant income tax return. Secondly, that the final notice was sent to the defendant normally at his or her address for service. Thirdly, that the defendant failed to comply with the requirements of the final notice. Four, that the defendant was capable of complying with the requirements of the final notice.  
         
         
        During the course of the oral argument the element in dispute had been distilled to that third element, that is, whether the defendant failed to comply with the requirements of the final notice. It appears clear that the other elements 1, 2 and four are made out. I have not heard submissions to the contrary.  
         
         
        Turning to that third element, that is the question whether the defendant failed to comply with the requirements of the final notice, the evidence establishes that on receipt of that notice, which is exhibit, 1 the chartered accountant, Stephen Rose, who was engaged by Mr Bates, had sent a letter to the Australian Taxation Office dated 12 May 2005. The letter firstly acknowledged the receipt of the final notice dated 7 May. It sought an extension in time to 30 June 2005.  
         
         
        After considering the evidence led in the Local Court, I am of the view here that the particular notice, which is exhibit 1, required the taxpayer to do one of two things in order to comply with that notice. Firstly, either send the return to the taxation office by the due date, or to seek an extension in time. The processes of the seeking of an extension in time were the subject of evidence during the course of the proceedings before the Magistrate. What is quite clear from that evidence is that there is a well recognised procedure for the application for extensions in time for a return to be remitted.  
         
         
        I am of the view, again in the circumstances of this particular case, that upon receipt of the notice, which is exhibit 1, that the taxpayer, through his accountant Mr Rose, had sent a letter to the taxation office. That finding is consistent with the Magistrate's finding on the evidence that such a letter was sent. The evidence does support that conclusion when one, not only looks at the evidence of Mr Rose, the taxpayer, but also the contents of the letter and the context of that letter with other emails that were exchanged. It was open to the Magistrate to conclude that the letter was in fact sent. I have, after considering the evidence, also conclude that the letter was in fact sent.  
         
         
        The Magistrate did not go on to decide the question as to whether the letter was in fact received, preferring to conclude that either the letter had gone astray somewhere within Australia Post or within the Australian Taxation Office. It appears that the Magistrate did not go on to consider deciding as a question of fact whether the Australian Taxation Office had received the letter.  
         
         
        I am of the view that having come to a finding that the letter was sent that it is reasonable to conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that the letter was received by the Australian Taxation Office. I am consequently of the view that in the circumstance the taxpayer had complied with the notice in legitimately seeking an extension in time for which a return could then be filed.  
         
         
        I am of the view that consequently, as of the 6th, that it could not be said that he was not complying with the notice because, reasonably, the period of time in which he would have reasonably presumed that he was not failing to comply would include the 6th June. In determining the period of time over 
          
        which the taxpayer could be said to be legitimately complying with the notice by seeking an extension of time in this matter, I have considered the contents of the charter of the Taxation Office.  
         
         
        It is not necessary to go on to decide the relationship of the charter to the particular legislation. All I need to decide is whether the defendant failed to comply with the requirements of the notice. I am of the view that he did not so fail to comply with the requirements in the sense that he legitimately applied for an extension in time. 
        
       
       
      SUBMISSIONS 
      
    13 It was submitted for the Crown that the terms of the document sent by the Commissioner were clear and unambiguous, that nothing in it was capable of supporting a finding that it could be complied with by making a request for an extension of time, and that there was no evidence capable of supporting an inference that it could be complied with in that way. Accordingly, the Crown submitted that question 1 disclosed an error of law: see The Australian Gaslight Company v. The Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR(NSW) 126 at 138, proposition (4).  
     
      
    14 Also, in circumstances where there was no evidence that the request for an extension had been granted or the return had been lodged within the time required in the document, the facts found by the primary judge necessarily amounted to the commission of the offence; so there was also an error of law disclosed in question 2. 
     
      
    15 The Crown submitted that the Court should act on s.5B(3) and quash the acquittal, and remit the matter to the District Court to be determined in accordance with the Court’s decision. The Crown referred to R v. Sirocic [2000] NSWCCA 325 and Robinson v. Woolworths Limited [2005] NSWCCA 426, both decided before the enactment of s.5B(3).  
     
      
    16 Mr. Raphael for Mr. Bates submitted that there was evidence to support the primary judge’s finding, namely evidence that there was a protocol in place for dealing with the request for extensions and that the Commissioner’s employees sought to comply with it and saw themselves as bound by it. Mr. Bates had a reasonable expectation of a reply to his request within 28 days because of this protocol; and having regard to the protocol, it was open for the primary judge not to be satisfied that Mr. Bates had failed to furnish the form “when and as required”.  
     
      
    17 Mr. Raphael also submitted that the Court should decline to answer questions which had no precedent value: Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v. X [2000] NSWCA 199, 49 NSWLR 653 at [42] and [165]; and should not expose Mr. Bates to double jeopardy. This was particularly so, when it was open to the Court not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr. Bates was capable of complying with the notice, this being a requirement of s.8C(1B) of the Taxation Administration Act.  
     
      
       
      DECISION 
      
    18 In my opinion, the findings of the primary judge that the notice required the taxpayer to do one of two things, either give the nominated income tax return to the Commissioner of Taxation by the nominated date or seek an extension of the time nominated in the notice, and that the making of a request for an extension amounted to evidence that the notice had been complied with, did amount to errors of law. The notice document was unequivocal, and could not be read as requiring anything other than the giving of the nominated tax returns to the Commissioner of Taxation by the nominated date.  
     
      
    19 However, I would add that this of itself would not be conclusive as to the commission of the offence. The relevant provisions (s.162 of the 1936 Act and s.8C of the 1953 Act) do not in terms require compliance with the terms of a written notice, and there is no section in the relevant legislation giving conclusive effect to such a notice. Each of the sections poses a question of fact as to what is required by the Commissioner; and although a notice given by the Commissioner is very powerful evidence of what is required by the Commissioner, it is not necessarily conclusive. Thus, for example, if there were a practice of suspending the requirements of the notice upon receipt of a request of an extension of time, and then either reinstating them if the extension is refused a reasonable time before the date specified in the notice, or otherwise substituting a different time, it would be arguable that, in the light of this practice, once a request had been made, what was required by the Commissioner was no longer as set out in the notice. 
     
      
    20 I am not saying that this argument would succeed on the facts of this case; but I am saying that it seems there could still be a question of fact to be addressed if the acquittal were quashed and the matter remitted to the District Court.  
     
      
    21 The other question raised by Mr. Raphael, as to whether it was established that Mr. Bates was capable of complying, carries little weight, in my opinion. As the Magistrate said, there was no clear or specific evidence from Mr. Bates or Mr. Rose or Mr. Bates’ bookkeeper that there was some significant or real difficulty in complying with the notice; and the Magistrate was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was capable. The primary judge saw no problem with that conclusion, and neither do I.  
     
      
    22 In Robinson, Basten JA doubted the view expressed in Sirocic to the effect that s.5B of the Criminal Appeal Act conferred power to overturn an acquittal. However, both those decisions were before the passage of s.5B(3); and in my opinion, s.5B(3) makes it clear that the Court has that power.  
     
      
    23 There is still a question whether, having regard to the double jeopardy principle, this Court should exercise the power. If the matter were sent back, it seems there could still be the question of fact to be addressed as to what was the requirement of the Commissioner, in the light of his protocols and practices. On the whole, having regard to the double jeopardy principle, I do not think the acquittal should be quashed and the matter sent back.  
     
      
    24 In my opinion the questions raised could be significant in other cases, and the primary judge’s decision should not stand as a precedent; and for those reasons, it is appropriate to answer the questions. However, for the reasons given, I would not make any further order. 
     
      
    25 Accordingly, I propose that both questions in the stated case be answered yes.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Graeme Frederick Connelly appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty to a serious offence. It is an offence of breaking and entering premises and then committing a serious indictable offence. The serious indictable offence committed was an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The offence is aggravated by the circumstance that at the time Mr Connelly broke into the premises he knew that the place was occupied. These events all occurred on 22 March 2007. On that day the offender was drinking heavily. He was also consuming drugs. In the evening he committed not only the offence for which he is to be specifically sentenced, but also other offences on a Form One which he asks me to take into account. 2 The first offence is one of the matters on the Form One. That occurred at about 9.10pm on 22 March 2007. Two gentlemen, a Peter Cullen and Mitchell Self, were at home. Mr Self is the offender’s brother-in-law. Mr Cullen is cared for by Mr Self. It appears that Mr Cullen is an epileptic. They are the only details I know about why it is that Mr Cullen has a carer. For reasons that are not all apparent, but which are clearly related to the offender’s intoxication, he and others forced open the front door of the premises where Mr Cullen and Mr Self lived. The offender was armed with a black metal pole and he had three other men with him. He handed the pole to one of those men and walked towards Mr Cullen. He swung a punch at Mr Cullen, but that did not connect. He said, “Where’s the money? Where’s the pot? Where’s the alcohol?” and then said, “If you call the police, I’ll kill yous. We’ll be back later for the rest.” The four of them then left leaving behind, no doubt, a frightened Mr Cullen and Mr Self. They, quite sensibly, called the police. That offence that I have just described is the first of the matters on the Form One.3 The offender returned later on that evening at 10.50pm. Again Mr Self and Mr Cullen were in their home. They heard the offender say, “I’m coming in this time” and then the back door of the premises was kicked in. The offender came in, turned the light on and walked in with other men behind him. Again he was carrying the black metal pole. He walked towards Mr Cullen who stood up. All that did was result in the offender head-butting Mr Cullen causing him to fall back onto the bed and hit his head on the wall. The offender addressed those who were with him by saying, “Come in boys and get everything.” After that, money was taken out of Mr Cullen’s wallet and Mr Self’s wallet. The offender was not finished, however. He punched Mr Cullen to the right and left side of his face. It seems that Mr Cullen was knocked unconscious. 4 The offender then left the premises, but returned with the other men. At this stage he grabbed a black pedestal fan and went to swing it at Mr Cullen who appears to have regained consciousness. Mr Cullen dived towards the offender and tackled him to the floor. They struggled it seems, but that cannot have lasted very long because Mr Connelly hit Mr Cullen to his face, again causing him to lose consciousness. Mr Self left the premises, no doubt afraid of what would happen to him. He ran out the back door and hid in the grass. Mr Cullen’s next recollection is being woken up by police.5 The other matter on the Form One relates to the fact that Mr Self’s mobile telephone was stolen during the home invasion. That phone was returned after he, that is, Mr Self rang his own number in an attempt to identify who had the phone. His sister, the offender’s de facto wife, answered the telephone. Mr Self heard the offender in the background saying, “I’ll pay the money back. I’ll replace the smokes. I’ll replace everything else that was damaged.” When Ms Whiting relayed this to Mr Self, Mr Self said, “It’s too late. It’s going through the police.” Mr Self did get his phone back after he went next door to his sister’s place and she gave the phone to him. The offender was arrested on 28 March, taken to Muswellbrook police station. He did participate in an interview with police, although he said that he could not recall the events of 22 March because of his high level of intoxication. He has been in custody since that date.6 The offender is twenty-four years of age. He is currently in a de facto relationship with Ms Whiting and they have four children. He has had a problem with alcohol for some considerable period of time. He was expelled at fifteen after he as Mr Booth put it, went off the rails when he was in high school once he started smoking drugs. His parents are both working and although other members of his family appear to have been in some trouble with the police, it cannot have been terribly serious trouble because the offender is the only member of his family to ever go to gaol. 7 After he was expelled, he started labouring and fruit picking which is where he met Ms Whiting. She has a commendable attitude towards drugs and alcohol. She does not take drugs, she does not drink alcohol and she does not like her husband doing either of those things. She has been in a de facto relationship with the offender since the offender was sixteen years of age. Since the offender has gone into custody it has been very difficult for Ms Whiting to visit him, especially as she has four children under eight. In fact, since he has been taken into custody he has only received two visits from Ms Whiting. That, of course, makes his time in custody harder than it would otherwise have been.8 The offender expressed remorse which I am satisfied is genuine. Not only did he say that he was sorry in court today, but he has told other people and, soon after he went into custody, prepared some letters which were sent to Mr Self and Mr Cullen in which he did express his regret for what occurred. As I have said, I am satisfied that those expressions of remorse are genuine. He understands the impact of his offence on Mr Cullen and Mr Self. He now understands also that because of his actions his wife and four children are more vulnerable to precisely the same sort of offence that he has himself committed.9 Since going into custody the offender has made attempts at rehabilitation and is now enrolled in the Phoenix Program at Cessnock gaol. It is program which takes thirteen or twenty-six weeks depending on how close the offender is to release from custody. 10 This is a very serious offence. It carries a maximum penalty of twenty years and also is one of those offences that has a standard non-parole period attached to it. Of course, the standard non-parole period is not of direct application in the present case because of the offender’s early plea of guilty, but it remains as a guidepost to the sentence that I should impose. The fact that it has a standard non-parole period I believe reflects the legislative concern at the level of sentences that have been imposed for offences such as this in the past. It is accurately described as a home invasion. Mr Cullen and Mr Self were entitled to feel safe in their home and should not have to put up with the back door of their premises being kicked in by the offender and others.11 The offence is aggravated, whether under s 112 or s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, by circumstances apart from that charged on the indictment. The offender was armed with that metal pole that I have spoken of and he was in company on each occasion that he entered the premises. I am not able to satisfy myself beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Cullen was vulnerable. There is that intriguing reference to him having a carer and I do know that he suffers from epilepsy, but that is not sufficient in my view to satisfy me that he is vulnerable as that term is used in s 21A.12 There are prospects of rehabilitation, but I am unable to say that they are good. There is a genuine desire on the part of the offender to rehabilitate himself and the offender clearly recognises the link between his consumption of alcohol and drugs and his offending, but more than genuine desire is required for the offender to achieve genuine rehabilitation. 13 There are special circumstances in this case. It is a matter where Mr Booth has asked that I make it a condition of the offender’s release to parole that he attend the William Booth rehabilitation program. That is a residential program and is in effect quasi-custody. Because of the length of the sentence I will shortly impose, it is not for me to determine the conditions of parole, but I say quite clearly that it is a recommendation of mine that it be a condition of his release to parole that he does attend the William Booth residential program. Assuming that is the case and that it results in a further period of quasi-custody upon the offender’s release from Corrective Services’ custody, I will find special circumstances resulting in a reduction of the time the offender will spend in custody and an enlargement of the period of eligibility for parole.14 There was some reference during the course of evidence to the position of the offender’s de facto wife and his four children. Clearly they will undergo hardship, but unfortunately such hardship as was referred to in evidence is not exceptional at all and I am unable to make any significant adjustment in the sentence that I would otherwise impose because of that circumstance. I do recognise, however, that the offender will do his time in custody harder. He blames himself for the predicament that he has placed his de facto wife and children in.15 Because of the offender’s plea of guilty, the sentence I will now announce is twenty-five per cent less than would otherwise have been the case. The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I impose a non-parole period of two years to commence on 28 March 2007 and a total sentence of four years. This means that the offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 27 March 2009.

    2 HOWIE J: The respondents to these Crown appeals were arraigned before the District Court on 19 February 2007, the trial date, on an indictment that contained two counts. The first count alleged an offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to section 33 of the Crimes Act. That offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. A standard non-parole period of seven years has been prescribed for that offence. The second count was in the alternative and alleged an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to section 35 of the Crimes Act. The respondents pleaded not guilty to the first count but guilty to the second count. However the Crown refused to accept the plea in full discharge of the indictment. The respondents then pleaded guilty to the first count. 
     
      
    3 They were dealt with by Judge Murrell SC (the Judge) as follows. The respondent Mitchell was sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of four years and a balance of term of four years. The sentence was to commence on 19 July 2006 and the respondent is eligible to be considered for release to parole on 18 July 2010. The respondent Gallagher was sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years and six months and a balance of term of two years and eight months. The sentence commenced on 5 March 2007. He is eligible to be released to parole on 4 September 2009. 
     
      
    4 At the date of the commission of the offence, 18 January 2006, the respondent Mitchell was aged 21 years. The respondent Gallagher was aged 20 years. The victim was aged 25. As a result of the assaults committed by the respondents upon him, the victim suffered extensive brain injury. He is confined to a wheelchair, has very limited speech and very severe cognitive problems from which he will never recover. His condition has been described, without exaggeration, as being in a “vegetative state” and “like a living death”. The effect on his parents of this catastrophic injury does not need to be described. 
     
      
    5 The facts can be briefly stated. The respondent Mitchell had a belief that the victim had sexually assaulted him some years earlier when the respondent was aged 10 or 11. Whether that belief had any basis in fact was left undetermined by her Honour. The two respondents had spent the day of the assault drinking alcohol and taking illegal drugs. As they were walking along a street, they came across the victim. The respondent Mitchell identified the victim as being responsible for the assault upon him. They attacked him, the respondent Mitchell throwing the first punch. The two became involved in a sustained attack upon the victim resulting in his being punched to the ground and then kicked to the head and body. As he lay on the ground the victim was unconscious or at least unable to defend himself. At one stage the respondent Mitchell picked up the victim and slammed him to the ground. They both continued to punch, kick and stomp on him despite calls from bystanders to desist. The Judge described the attack as “vicious”. The respondent Mitchell was the primary offender but Gallagher also punched the victim to the head and kicked him as he lay on the ground. The respondent Gallagher was the first to abandon the assault but this occurred when the two were confronted by bystanders who came to assist the victim. 
     
      
    6 Her Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I accept that both offenders were very, very intoxicated. I accept that neither intended to cause physical injury to the extent to which injury was sustained. I accept that neither would have become involved except that each was heavily under the influence of alcohol and drugs and except that each believe that the victim had sexually assaulted Mr Mitchell when Mr Mitchell was a child” 
        
       
      
    7 In reference to the seriousness of the offence, the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The injuries which were suffered by the victim could hardly have been worse. He was not killed, but his condition is like a living death. It is relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence, that the injuries sustained by the victim are of the most serious kind. The assault was a brutal, sustained attack. 
        
       
      
    8 Later her Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        There are some matters which mitigate, to some extent, the objective seriousness of the offence. Alcohol and drugs were strong contributing factors. There was no premeditation. It was by sheer bad luck that the offenders encountered the victim when they were seriously intoxicated. The assault was fuelled not only by alcohol and drugs but also by the firm conviction on Mr Mitchell's part, which he had shared with his best friend, Mr Gallagher, that the victim was a child molester and had attacked him. The factors of alcohol, drugs and this belief operated on Mr Mitchell's mind to cause him to, in effect, explode. There was no weapon used in the offence but the attack with feet, which involved kicking and stomping directed particularly to the victim's head was vicious in the extreme. Mr Gallagher was wearing thongs and/or bare feet at the time, but he is a big man and it is not much to the point that he did not have shoes or boots on at the time. That the offence was committed in company is a factor which aggravates it. 
        
       
      
    9 The respondent Mitchell was aged 22 at the date of sentence. He had a criminal record including an offence of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm dealt with in the Children’s Court and for which he had been subject to a control order. In June 2005 he was placed on a bond for an offence of assault arising from an act of retaliation to a perceived threat made to him by the person assaulted. That bond was current at the time of this offence. In 2006 he was sentenced for offences of break, enter and steal and had been given a non-parole period of 6 months. He was due for release on 17 July 2006 but remained in custody on remand for the present offence. 
     
      
    10 There was little in his background of relevance, except that he had sought treatment in respect of the effects of the alleged sexual assault by the victim but had failed to keep appointments with a treating psychologist. He had been abusing alcohol and cannabis and also using amphetamines and ecstasy on occasions around the time of the offence. The Judge found that he was remorseful. Before going into custody he had been an apprenticed panel beater. He has been in protective custody since he was incarcerated in January 2006. His father had noticed a change in his attitude since he had been placed into custody. 
     
      
    11 The respondent Gallagher was aged 21 at the date of sentence. He had no prior convictions and was considered by his employer as honest and reliable. He was employed as an apprenticed chef. He had also been involved in community works such as Meals on Wheels. He had a disruptive childhood because of the inability of his mother to cope with him as a baby. There was evidence that his father had physically abused him. However he enjoyed the love and support of his grandparents with whom he had lived in the period before the offence. Although he had a short temper, that had only been manifest in verbal anger. He had voluntarily undertaken an anger management course. He had a problem with alcohol and cannabis but had sought counselling in respect of both and was no longer using cannabis at the time of sentencing. The Judge found that he was very remorseful. 
     
      
    12 The Judge was of the view that the offence fell within “at least the midrange of objective seriousness”. She also said “overall it is an offence of very substantial seriousness”. The apparent contradictory nature of those two statements was taken up by the Crown at the hearing of the appeal as indicative of error. 
     
      
    13 Her Honour found that in the case of the respondent Mitchell the prior assault was not an aggravating feature. This is somewhat surprising having regard to the nature of the offence as retaliation for a perceived wrong done by the victim. This was precisely the motivation for the present offence. The Judge found that the offence was aggravated by the fact that it was committed in company, that there was gratuitous cruelty by reason of the number of kicks administered to the victim, that there was a very substantial injury sustained and that the respondent Mitchell was on conditional liberty. She found that the offence was mitigated by the circumstance that the respondent believed he had been maltreated by the victim, that there was a “good chance” that he would be rehabilitated, that he was very remorseful and the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    14 In the case of the respondent Gallagher, the Judge found that the same aggravating features were present. She found that there was mitigation in the fact that the respondent had no prior criminal record, that he had excellent prospects of rehabilitation, a high level of remorse and the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    15 Her Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “There are a number of distinctions which can be drawn between the two offenders. Some distinctions which are, to my mind, very significant for sentencing purposes, are, first, that Mr Mitchell was the instigator and the principal assailant. Mr Gallagher was not the instigator and he was not the principal assailant, but he certainly participated to a substantial degree. Mr Gallagher has no prior criminal record of any type and there is other evidence of good behaviour in relation to Mr Gallagher. I do not consider the age difference between the men to be of any significance.” 
        
       
      
    16 Her Honour saw the promotion of the rehabilitation of each of the respondents as of importance because of their age and stated that general deterrence was of less significance. She also acknowledged the importance of denouncing their conduct and the harm done to the victim and his family. She saw it as necessary, in particular, to denounce the fact that the respondents had taken the law into their own hands, a matter that she described as “inexcusable”. This finding is to my mind difficult to reconcile with the fact that the Judge found it to be a mitigating factor that the respondents believed that the victim had sexually assaulted Mitchell. 
     
      
    17 Her Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In relation to each of the offenders, taking into account the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty and the very high level of remorse which each has indicated, I intend to reduce the sentences which I would otherwise have imposed by a factor of 20 per cent.” 
        
       
      
    18 The Judge found there were special circumstances in each case to reduce the non-parole period from the statutory ratio. The Crown has not argued that that finding was not available to her Honour. The Judge took into account in relation to the respondent Mitchell that he was in protective custody and that the respondent Gallagher “may well seek protection in custody as well”. 
     
      
    19 In written submissions the Crown argued that the Judge had given too much weight to the subjective circumstances of each of the respondents in determining the sentences that she imposed upon them. It was also submitted that the Judge had failed to record any reason for departing from the standard non-parole period of seven years that applied to the offence to which the respondents had pleaded guilty. The Crown contended that little regard to the standard non-parole period is found within the reasons for sentence and that her Honour had failed to give it sufficient weight. 
     
      
    20 In oral argument before the Court the Crown extended its criticism of the exercise of the Judge’s sentencing discretion to include the fact that a discount of 20 per cent had been awarded to the respondents notwithstanding that they had pleaded guilty on the date of the trial and by taking into account their remorse. It was submitted that this was contrary to the decision of this Court in R v MAK and MSK (2006) 167 A Crim R 159. It was also submitted that the Judge had failed to determine, for the purposes of applying the standard non-parole provisions, where the offending of each of the respondents fell within the range of criminal conduct encompassed by an offence contrary to s 33. As a result of these errors and otherwise, the Crown contended that the sentences were manifestly inadequate to a degree warranting the intervention of this Court notwithstanding the youth of the respondents. 
     
      
    21 On behalf of the respondent Mitchell, Mr Dhanji reminded the Court of the principles that apply in relation to a Crown appeal and in particular the discretions available to this Court in determining whether to interfere with the sentence imposed and the extent that it should resentence the respondent if error had been established by the Crown. He quoted from the well-known passage in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 where Wood CJ at CL summarised the relevant principles. It is unnecessary to set them out again in this judgment but I acknowledge their continuing significance and the importance generally of the discretion residing in a sentencing judge. 
     
      
    22 Mr Dhanji submitted that no error had been shown in the exercise of the Judge’s discretion and that the sentence was not manifestly inadequate. In particular it was submitted that there had not been any error in the application of the standard non-parole provisions, the Judge correctly indicating that it provided a ""guidepost in terms of sentencing"". He noted that the deviation from the standard non-parole period was largely as a result of her Honour providing a discount of 20 per cent and a finding of special circumstances. It was submitted that each of these findings was within the Judge’s discretion. Mr Dhanji described the respondent Mitchell's subjective case as ""powerful"". He also referred to the fact that the Crown appeal was not launched until a month after the respondent had been sentenced, although the respondent had been notified within a week of being sentenced that the Crown was considering an appeal. 
     
      
    23 Ms Cox on behalf of the respondent Gallagher adopted the submissions that had been made both in writing and orally by Mr Dhanji. She made further written submissions with leave after the Court had reserved its decision as to the Judge’s finding in relation to where the offence stood in the range of criminal activity encompassed by s 33. She relied upon the motive for the attack as diminishing the degree of objective seriousness and relied upon R v Camilleri (NSWCCA, unreported, 2 February 1990) and R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 in support of that proposition. She also noted this Court’s reluctance to interfere with a finding made by a sentencing judge as to the objective seriousness of an offence; see R v Mirza [2007] NSWCCA 248. 
     
      
    24 In my opinion the sentences are manifestly inadequate and to a very significant degree. In addition there are clear errors in the exercise of the Judge’s discretion. It was not reasonably open to her Honour to award the respondents a discount of 20 per cent for a plea of guilty occurring on the trial date by taking into account the remorse of the respondents. It was made clear in R v MAK and MSK that no numerical discount should be given for remorse, either by itself of in conjunction with a plea of guilty. To do so is to run the risk of double counting, as remorse is a significant consideration in determining the offender’s prospects for rehabilitation and the likelihood of reoffending. The appropriate discount for the utilitarian value of the plea was no more than 10 per cent. 
     
      
    25 The Judge was also in error in a more substantial way in failing to make a specific finding as to where the offence fell in the range of offending covered by the section. It was not sufficient for her Honour merely to find that the offence was within “at least the mid range of objective seriousness”: see R v Knight [2007] NSWCCA 283. Such a finding seems to suggest that her Honour thought it was sufficient to determine whether the offence was at least of mid-range seriousness rather than to go further and indicate whether, and to what degree, it was above that range. The finding was inconsistent with the further finding that the offence was “of very substantial seriousness”. With respect the latter finding was correct: the former was not. 
     
      
    26 Her Honour attributes to the Crown Prosecutor appearing before her a submission that the offence was “at least in the mid range” and then purports to adopt that submission. In fact the prosecutor submitted at the outset of his submissions that the objective seriousness of the offence “falls squarely within the upper range”. He repeated that submission on at least one other occasion during the course of his address. With respect that submission was clearly correct and should have been adopted by her Honour. 
     
      
    27 A very important aspect of an offence under s 33 is the result of the offender’s conduct. The nature of the injury caused to the victim will to a very significant degree determine the seriousness of the offence and the appropriate sentence. This is not to underestimate the intent component of the offence, after all that is the element that makes the offender liable to a maximum penalty of 25 years as opposed to 7 years for a s 35 offence. But there is less scope for variation in the nature of the intention to do grievous bodily harm when determining the seriousness of a particular instance of the offence than there is for variation in the nature of the injury inflicted. It should be borne in mind that, if the victim had died, the respondents would have faced a charge of murder. The injury suffered by the victim was, as her Honour noted, little short of death. 
     
      
    28 The nature of the injury suffered by the victim was in the very worst category that could be envisaged for the offence. That itself brought the offence into a very serious category. There was little mitigation in the conduct of the respondents that caused that injury. The acts of the respondents were rightly described by her Honour as a sustained and vicious attack upon the victim. It continued unabated even when the victim was unable to defend himself. It ceased only because of intervention from others seeking to protect the victim. Of course the offence could have been objectively more serious. As her Honour noted, the offence was apparently not premeditated and the respondents were not armed with weapons. But had it been a planned attack with the use of weapons, it would have been approaching the worst category of an offence under s 33 and would have warranted, before any applicable discounts, a sentence approaching the maximum penalty provided notwithstanding the youth of the respondents. 
     
      
    29 With respect to her Honour, when an offence is as objectively serious as this particular offence was, there is a limited scope to ameliorate the penalty by promoting the rehabilitation of the offenders, especially in the case of Mitchell who was on a bond for an offence of violence committed in retaliation against the victim for some assumed wrong. I fail to understand why her Honour thought that general deterrence was of less significance in the circumstances of this case just because the respondents were young men. Violence on the streets especially by young men in company and under the influence of alcohol or drugs is all too common and needs to be addressed by sentences that carry a very significant degree of general deterrence. 
     
      
    30 The offence was one well above the mid-range of objective culpability. True it was not one where the respondents cold-bloodedly singled out an innocent passer-by as the subject for their drug-fuelled aggression. If such had been the case, the offence would have been aggravated by that fact. I accept that it was a relevant factor that the respondents believed that the victim had been guilty of sexual activity to the respondent Mitchell: R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47. But a grievance with the conduct of another, whether justified or not, cannot be a license to commit crime even where the conduct alleged by the victim is one of sexual assault. In the circumstances of the present case the motive of the respondents for assaulting the victim was of limited mitigating value. 
     
      
    31 The relevance of motive will vary depending upon the particular facts of the case. It may explain why the offence was committed without condoning or excusing it. The more serious the offence committed the less weight that can be given to motive as a mitigating factor, even if it might otherwise have had that effect. But as was pointed out in Swan, the existence of motive is relevant to other factors that may impact upon the sentencing discretion. In this case, particularly with respect to the respondent Gallagher, it partly explains why he committed such a serious offence notwithstanding that he had no prior criminal record and was otherwise considered a person of good character, apart from his use of illicit drugs. The existence of the motive indicated that in his case there was no need for personal deterrence. But because of Mitchell’s prior offence of violence and because he was on a bond at the time, the significance of motive in this respect was reduced and it was appropriate to consider personal deterrence as a relevant factor notwithstanding his remorse. 
     
      
    32 It is importance therefore to understand that the existence of a motive for the commission of a crime and the nature of that motive may be important factors in the exercise of the sentencing discretion but may in some cases point in different directions. It may to some degree mitigate the objective seriousness of the offence yet indicate the need for a more severe sentence in order to address issues of deterrence. In some cases, as where the use of illegal drugs explains the commission of the offence, it offers no mitigation of the objectives seriousness of the offence, yet may allow significance to be given to rehabilitation of the offender: see generally Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
     
      
    33 In Swan a significant matter was the fact that the offender was intellectually disabled. He offended against the victim not only in order to achieve personal retribution for the sexual assaults committed against him but also from a misguided view that he was dissuading the victim from assaulting other intellectually impaired persons, as he believed the victim had been doing. In considering what he did and the reason he did it, his intellectual impairment was a relevant factor. It was for this reason that the Court was able to attenuate the need to deter persons from taking the law into their own hands: see per Spigelman CJ at [60]. There was no such attenuating factor in the present case. 
     
      
    34 There was little mitigation of the objective seriousness of the offence in the fact that the respondents were intoxicated by alcohol and the use of illegal drugs and that this in some way caused their uninhibited violence toward the victim. The court cannot permit a person to rely upon the fact that he had been ingesting illegal drugs as in any way excusing offending conduct or its consequences. It may be mitigating in so far as it indicates that the offence was impulsive, unplanned and that the offender’s capacity to exercise judgment was impaired: Waters v R [2007] NSWCCA 219 at [38]. In this case its chief relevance was to the prospects of the respondents’ rehabilitation in light of the evidence that they had both been addressing that issue. 
     
      
    35 The Judge took into account as a mitigating factor that the respondents did not intend the degree of harm that was caused to the victim. That consideration would be understandable in a case where the injury far outweighed what might have been envisaged as the consequence of the behaviour causing it. Such a consideration might be relevant in the case of, for example, a single punch to the face that results in the victim falling to the ground and suffering very grievous injuries as a consequence. But in this case the respondents indulged in what her Honour described as a brutal and sustained attack upon a defenceless person by kicking or stomping on his head and body while he was lying on the ground. The fact that the respondents might not have foreseen that the consequence of such serious conduct was to have left the victim in a vegetative state is of little, if any, weight in my opinion. 
     
      
    36 This case brings into sharp focus the difficulty of applying the standard non-parole provisions in a case where the standard non-parole period specified for a particular offence does not represent a non-parole period that would normally be appropriate for an offence falling within the midpoint of the prescribed statutory maximum. There are other examples, some where the standard non-parole period is equal to, or more than, half of the maximum penalty, see R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 and some where the standard non-parole period is considerably less than half the maximum penalty. The latter category of offence was considered in R v Marshall [2007] NSWCCA 24, a case concerned with aggravated break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(2). There I wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        34 ……….. it is not an easy task to make sense of, and apply, the standard non-parole period provisions in relation to s 112(2) offences. Firstly, the standard non-parole period is 5 years as against a head sentence of 20 years. One would expect as a matter of logic and the application of ordinary sentencing principles that, if an offence was hypothetically of the mid-range of seriousness, it would carry a sentence of half the maximum penalty, that is a total term of ten years and, according to the statutory proportion under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, a non-parole period of seven and a half years. What then is to be made of the fact that the standard non-parole period is only 5 years? Does this disclose the intention of Parliament that the courts should take a more benign view of an offence under s 112(2) than the maximum penalty would seem to suggest? How does a court determine the sentence where the seriousness of the offence is somewhere above the mid-range of seriousness but below the most serious category of an offence under the section: by having more regard to the standard non-parole period or to the maximum penalty? 
        
       
      
    37 Where a particular case falls well above the mid-range of offending, the standard non-parole period will have less significance as a guidepost and more attention should be directed to the maximum penalty in determining the appropriate sentence. This must be so otherwise an offence falling within the worst category of case, and so notionally attracting the maximum penalty, would be drawn away from that point by the standard non-parole period and a court could never impose the maximum penalty. This does not mean that the standard non-parole period loses all relevance and it may still have work to do as a guide to determining the non-parole period. So, for example, with an offence of objective seriousness well above mid-range it may be unlikely that, even after a discount for the plea of guilty, or a consideration of the subjective circumstances of the offender or a finding of special circumstances the result would be a non-parole of, or below, the standard non-parole period prescribed. 
     
      
    38 Of course when the maximum penalty is the principal factor used as a guide in determining the appropriate sentence rather than the standard non-parole period, the court is then considering primarily what the total term of the sentence should be. The court determines as against the maximum penalty, and taking into account that this is the prima facie sentence for an offence falling within the worst category of offending encompassed by the section, how serious is the criminality in the particular case and how much of the maximum penalty is warranted having regard to all relevant sentencing considerations including of course those matters specified in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the purposes of sentencing as set out in s 3A of that Act. 
     
      
    39 In my opinion the Judge failed fully to determine the degree of objective seriousness of the offence as required of her when dealing with an offence to which there is a relevant standard non-parole period. This is an error that resulted in a miscarriage of her sentencing discretion and requires this Court to make that assessment itself: cf R v Muleto [2006] NSWCCA 282 and R v Mirza [2007] NSWCCA 248. 
     
      
    40 In the present case the Judge should have concluded that the offence substantially exceeded the mid-range of offending having regard to all the objective facts including in particular that the injury suffered by the victim was of the worst possible kind that could fall within the scope of the section. Her Honour ought then to have considered where in the range of offending, so far as the maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment was concerned, such an offence came. Because the offending was not premeditated and the respondents did not arm themselves with weapons and because of their subjective circumstances, in neither case did the offending fall within the worst category. However, as the objective seriousness was well above mid-range, it warranted a notional head sentence, before discount for the plea and a finding of special circumstances, at least exceeding half the maximum penalty for the offence. 
     
      
    41 The criminality of the respondent Gallagher was somewhat less than Mitchell but not to a very substantial degree. He was a party to the infliction of the injury upon the victim in a real sense and not simply by way of derivative culpability as might be the case had he simply aided and abetted his co-offender. It was too late for him to remedy the harm intentionally inflicted upon the victim or to reduce his culpability for that harm by being the first to decide that enough punishment had been meted out. On one view his culpability was greater than the respondent Mitchell because he had no personal reason to be vindictive toward the victim. However, as the Crown did not contend that her Honour was in error in differentiating between the respondents, this Court should also moderate the sentence to be imposed upon him in view of his slightly lesser criminality and his more favourable subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    42 In considering this appeal two affidavits were tendered to the Court regarding the circumstances of the respondents since being sentenced. The respondent Mitchell is still being held in protection although he says nothing about the nature of that protection or how it impacts upon him. He has expressed a wish to do as many courses as are available to him. He claims to be suffering from a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the abuse inflicted upon him. He is also depressed as a result of what he has done and the fact that there have been three deaths in his family while he has been in custody. In respect of the respondent Gallagher he is in protection at his own request. He is keen to undertake courses but none have so far been made available to him. He has been recently housed in Cooma and his grandparents visit him when they are able to do so. He is being treated for depression. 
     
      
    43 In my opinion the sentences are so inadequate that this Court should intervene and re-sentence the respondents notwithstanding their youth and the fact that it is their first time in custody. The sentence for Gallagher was particularly inadequate and such a discrepancy between the sentences for the two respondents cannot be justified. 
     
      
    44 The prosecutor before her Honour submitted that the discount for the pleas of guilty because of a “combination of factors” should be 15 per cent. That was an erroneous submission but the respondents should be given the benefit of it. Had her Honour discounted the sentences by that amount, the Crown would not have been heard to complain about that fact in this Court. It is too late for the Crown now to submit that the discount should have been no more than 10 per cent. 
     
      
    45 The notional head sentence before any discount should have been somewhere in the vicinity of 14 to 16 years for the respondent Mitchell and 11 to 13 years for the respondent Gallagher. Because this is a Crown appeal I am prepared to start at the lowest point in each of those ranges. A discount of 15 per cent reduces those sentences to about 12 years in the case of Mitchell and about 9 years 4 months in the case of Gallagher. The Court has been shown statistics that indicate that there has been only one sentence of more than 12 years imposed for an offence under s 33 since February 2003. That is somewhat surprising in view of the maximum penalty prescribed. However, having regard to the very serious nature of the offence, no lesser sentence could be justified for either respondent. 
     
      
    46 There should be a finding of special circumstances because of the young age of both of the respondents and the need for them to re-establish themselves after a very lengthy period in custody. The judge set a non-parole period of 50 per cent of the head sentence. I can see no justification for such a reduction in the statutory ratio in either case. A finding of special circumstances should not be used as a means to simply ameliorate the sentence. It is a finding that serves a purpose that will usually be to extend the period of supervision but may include other reasons. With a lengthy sentence a finding of special circumstances is less likely to be made because the period of parole provided as a result of applying the statutory ratio will give sufficient time for supervision and the other benefits of parole. To some extent the inadequacy of the present sentences is a result of the reduction of the non-parole periods to a point where they fail to reflect the seriousness of the crime committed by the respondents. It reflects a considerable amount of double counting of factors such as, in Mitchell’s case, the fact that he is on protection. 
     
      
    47 I doubt that on re-sentencing the respondents a finding of special circumstances is warranted given the period on parole that would be produced by the statutory ratio. However in light of the fact that this is a Crown appeal and the Crown apparently accepted that such a finding would be made, I am prepared to make that finding. However, regard must be had to the standard non-parole period which, as I have indicated, still remains a relevant guidepost to the appropriate non-parole period. In this case the sentence of Mitchell will result in a non-parole period that accords with the standard non-parole period notwithstanding that the offence committed was very much more serious than a mid-range offence. This is only because of the plea of guilty, the finding of special circumstances and the mitigation of what was otherwise the appropriate sentence having regard to the fact that this is a Crown appeal. The non-parole period that should have been imposed in the District Court should have exceeded the standard non-parole period by about 2 years. 
     
      
    48 Similarly in the case of Gallagher the non-parole period is less than should have been imposed by the Judge. The sentence that I believe now should be imposed has in his case been very considerably moderated in recognition of this being a re-sentencing after a Crown appeal. The sentence in his case was so inappropriately lenient that now to impose the sentence that ought to have been imposed upon him by the sentencing judge, even taking into account the bottom of the permissible range, would be crushing. 
     
      
    49 I propose the following orders. In respect of each respondent the Crown appeal is allowed. The sentences imposed in the District Court are quashed. In the case of the respondent Mitchell he is sentenced to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 7 years with a balance of term of 5 years to date from 19 July 2006. He is eligible to be considered for release to parole on 18 July 2013. In the case of the respondent Gallagher he is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 4 years 4 months to date from 5 March 2007. He is eligible to be considered for release to parole on 4 March 2012. 
     
      
    50 After I had written the draft of this judgment and determined what sentences should now be imposed upon the respondents, I became aware of a recent decision of this Court dealing with a Crown appeal that has considerable similarities with the present matter both in relation to the facts of the offence under consideration and the arguments raised by the Crown in criticism of the sentence imposed. None of the parties referred to this decision in their submissions either in writing or orally. The failure of the Crown to draw the attention of the Court to this decision is of particular concern, given the fact that it was a successful Crown appeal where this Court re-sentenced the respondent for the same offence as that for which the respondents were sentenced. 
     
      
    51 In R v Jione [2007] NSWCCA 170 the Crown appealed against a sentence imposed in the District Court for an offence contrary to s 33. The respondent had pleaded guilty and was sentenced to effectively a sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. The victim in that matter was beaten and kicked by the respondent, apparently because of some dispute arising between them at a hotel, causing the victim catastrophic brain injuries similar to that suffered by the victim in the present matter and leaving him in a permanent vegetative state. The sentencing judge described the offence as being in the mid-range of objective seriousness. This Court concluded that, having regard to the injuries suffered by the victim being as serious as they could be short of death, the offence was “well above the category of mid range and in the category of high seriousness”. 
     
      
    52 Grove J, who gave the leading judgment, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        12 It has been established that the standard non-parole period should be understood as having been specified for mid range offences where there has been conviction after trial:  
        R v Way 
         (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, but the prescription continues to provide a benchmark for sentencing when there has been a guilty plea. But it is not a sole benchmark and there is nothing in Part 4 Division 1A to suggest that the statutory maximum ceases to provide a reference for sentence assessment. That maximum reveals a policy of the Legislature relevant to penalty for particular offence:  
        Gibson v The Queen 
         (1991) 172 CLR 353 at p 364 and has been described as a reflection of public perception of seriousness:  
        R v H 
         [1980] 3 A Crim R 53 at p 65. 
        
       
      
    53 The respondent in that case was re-sentenced by this Court to an effective term of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years. That sentence took into account a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea from an otherwise appropriate starting sentence of 16 years. 
     
      
    54 There is little by way of statement of principle in this decision. The passage I have quoted above is very much reflected in what I had written about the relationship between the standard non-parole period and the maximum penalty. The error attributed to the sentencing judge by that Court is similar to the error I find by the Judge in sentencing the respondents: a failure to properly evaluate the objective seriousness of the respondents’ conduct and hence paying too little regard to the maximum penalty. 
     
      
    55 Of course there are differences in the facts between the offence consider by the Court in Jione and that committed by the present respondents. There are also differences in the subjective circumstances of the different respondents. The decision in Jione is a result of the exercise of that Court’s discretion and is not strictly binding on this Court. But it is a guide to the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the respondents. Having reviewed my reasons for allowing the appeal against the respondents in light of what was said by the Court in Jione and the sentences that I had proposed should now be imposed in light of the sentence imposed by this Court in that case, I am confirmed in my mind that the orders I propose are the appropriate ones. 
     
      
    56 FULLERTON J: I agree with Howie J.

      JUDGMENT – Fitness to be tried 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Mr Russell Clement Wills was convicted by a jury of the murder of Hans Hoch at Surry Hills on 16 July 2002. He was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of eighteen years with a non-parole period of fourteen years. At the time he was sentenced there was evidence before the sentencing judge of a psychiatric illness. The sentencing judge had regard to that aspect of the matter as he was required to do when imposing the sentence.  
     
      
    2 Mr Wills appealed his conviction and sentence. The matter came before the Court of Criminal Appeal before which it was submitted that having regard to the evidence of his psychiatric problems there was a question as to whether or not he was fit to be tried at the time of his trial. The Court considered that submission and in a judgment which was delivered by Beazley JA, with whom the other judges agreed, her Honour expressed the opinion that the medical evidence at sentence and the evidence before the Court of Criminal Appeal raised a question of Mr Wills' fitness to be tried, in particular, in relation to his ability to make a proper defence to the charge.  
     
      
    3 Dr Nielssen, who gave evidence before the Court of Criminal Appeal, was accepted by the court when he indicated that the appellant's lack of insight into his medical condition meant that he was not able to give instructions to his lawyers at the time of the trial. The court of course did not determine whether he was unfit to be tried but nevertheless the question having been raised in the court, and the court being satisfied that there may have been the relevant difficulty, concluded that as the evidence stood the court was not satisfied that Mr Wills would have been found fit for trial had the matter been raised at his trial. The court proceeded to quash the conviction and order that a fitness hearing be conducted in pursuance of an order which the court made that there be a new trial.  
     
      
    4 The required fitness hearing has been conducted before me. As it transpires the evidence, from both sides, is to the effect that Mr Wills is now fit to be tried. The Crown has tendered reports from Dr Rosalie Wilcox, a general and forensic psychiatrist. Apart from the reports which were available to the Court of Criminal Appeal from Dr Wilcox there is a further report dated 22 October 2007 in which she has particular regard to the requirements of the law in relation to the question of fitness and expresses the view that Mr Wills is fit to be tried.  
     
      
    5 Dr Nielssen has also given evidence before me. Apart from two earlier reports of Dr Nielssen which formed the basis for the determination in the Court of Criminal Appeal Dr Nielssen has given oral evidence. It was Dr Nielssen who examined the appellant and gave evidence at the time of his sentence hearing raising the question of psychiatric illness. In his report of October 2006 Dr Nielssen identified that Mr Wills had an alcohol dependence and abuse which was in remission since his arrest. He also identified brain damage, secondary to trauma, and alcohol abuse and identified a condition of schizophrenia in Mr Wills. He said that at that time he believed Mr Wills had a chronic schizophrenic illness. He further believed that on the balance of probabilities Mr Wills was unfit to enter a plea and was unfit at the time of his trial when he was experiencing acute symptoms of mental illness that led him to believe that he was in danger. His illness affected his ability to follow the proceedings and prevented him giving instructions that may have offered an alternative explanation of the events or at least raised the issue of his own abnormal mental state.  
     
      
    6 In his evidence before me today Dr Nielssen said that he had conducted a further examination of Mr Wills and having regard to the tests laid down by the court in R v Presser (1958) VR 45 and Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230 he was of the opinion that Mr Wills is presently fit to plead. It would appear that the problems which Dr Nielssen previously identified were as a result of Mr Wills not maintaining his regime of psychiatric medication. It is undoubted that Mr Wills suffers from a psychiatric illness but it is the opinion of Dr Nielssen that if appropriately medicated his symptoms can be kept under control with the consequence that he would be fit to plead at a future trial. In particular, Dr Nielssen is satisfied, having regard to his recent examination of Mr Wills, that he presently has a capacity to decide the defence that he will rely upon and to instruct counsel as to the defence which he wishes to have conducted on his behalf. This was the problem which Dr Nielssen previously identified.  
     
      
    7 In those circumstances, having regard to all of the evidence, I am satisfied that Mr Wills is fit to plead.  
     
      
    8 There is one further matter which I should address. Dr Nielssen's present opinion is based upon the reintroduction of the medication regime necessary to control Mr Wills' symptoms. The medication which is being utilised with effect is Quetiapine with the commercial name of Seroquel. This medication is prescribed for Mr Wills by medical officers within the prison system. Apparently there are other medications which may achieve the same result, some of which may not have the side effects of Quetiapine.  
     
      
    9 Dr Nielssen believes that unless suitable medication is continued there is a risk that Mr Wills' condition may deteriorate with the consequence that he may have difficulties at his further trial. It will also be important that during the course of that trial having regard to the exigencies that Mr Wills will necessarily undergo being transported to and from the court, with intrusions into his usual regime, that arrangements be made to ensure that his medication is available to him and that it is taken.  
     
      
    10 To this end I recommend to the authorities responsible for his health that Mr Wills be regularly reviewed by the Parklea Mental Health Unit which should also ensure that appropriate medication is provided to him. I also recommend that the Mental Health Unit prepare a report which would be available to both the Crown and the defence at the commencement of the future trial which provides an assessment of his medical condition at that time and also provides an account of the regime which has been put in place to ensure that the medication will be both available and taken by Mr Wills during the course of the trial. The present state of Mr Wills' health could be affected unless appropriate arrangements are in place and his medication is maintained.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: One morning Ida Schmidt left her home in Cessnock to go for her daily walk; this was early in the morning. She was entitled, of course, to go about her daily activities in safety but on this occasion, on 13 May 2007, she met up with the offender who had been out drinking all night. What the offender did was, I am satisfied, directly related to his substantial level of intoxication but in the circumstances of this case it is not much of a mitigating feature because, to his knowledge, in the past he had committed offences due to his excessive alcohol consumption.2 The offender came up to Ms Schmidt and asked her the time. She said, “It’s 6.30.” The offender was acting strangely and Ms Schmidt became concerned. She thought he may have been drunk because he repeated the question, “I’m sorry but what is the time?” and his speech was indistinct. Ms Schmidt stepped onto the roadway but she was almost immediately grabbed by the offender. At this stage she did not realise that the person who grabbed her was the same person who had been asking her the time but she later learnt that it was the offender who was doing both these things.3 The offender held her tightly and walked her towards a grassed footpath area. Beyond that was a cleared paddock area. It became apparent from later events that what the offender was doing was detaining Ms Schmidt because he wanted to rape her.4 Somewhere along the grassed area Ms Schmidt lost her balance and she began to fall to the ground. The offender grabbed her by the hair and pulled her further away from the road. When Miss Schmidt landed on the ground she was dragged by the offender, who had hold of her hair. He dragged her about five or six metres before putting her against the trunk of a tree. Not unnaturally, Miss Schmidt was loudly screaming for help. The offender responded by putting his hand over her mouth and said, “Be quiet, I won’t hurt you.”5 Miss Schmidt said that she was not extremely worried at this stage because she was close to the roadway and possible passers-by. No doubt her concerns escalated when the offender lifted her up from where she was and began walking with her, holding on to her arm, in the direction of a cleared paddock behind a rural fire service building. Clearly, what the offender wanted to do was to take Miss Schmidt to somewhere private where he could carry out his intention which, I repeat, was to rape Miss Schmidt.6 He said to her, “Keep walking” and when she asked, “Where are we going to?” he said, “Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you.” Their conversation continued with the offender saying, “I have no luck with the ladies”, with Miss Schmidt, replying “I don’t think so, I don’t believe it.” The offender expressed remorse for what he was doing for the first time. He said, “I should kill myself. What am I doing here? I should kill myself. What am I doing to my family?” 7 It is to be noted that there, there are no expressions of remorse for what he was doing to Miss Schmidt although they did come later. Miss Schmidt said, “Don’t do it, it’s not worth it; you’re a young man.” The offender asked for a cuddle. 8 As she was walking with the offender, Miss Schmidt was able to move away from him. She thought about running away but decided against it as she thought he would be able to catch her, given that she was seventy-one years of age and the offender was twenty-eight. Her concerns were probably correct.9 All of a sudden the offender sat down on the ground. Miss Schmidt remained standing and noticed three people coming to her rescue. Those three people had seen Miss Schmidt was in trouble where she was being dragged by the hair. As they approached Miss Schmidt and the offender the offender remained seated on the ground. The offender curled up into a ball and yelled out, “I need help, I need help, I need help.” As the three rescuers got to Miss Schmidt the offender said, “I need help, I need a flogging.”10 Police were called and whilst they were coming the offender said a number of other things expressing his remorse for what he was doing: “I need help, I need help, I need a good flogging. I can’t believe this, I can’t believe the things I have done.” He said, “Kill me, kill me now. What have I done?”11 One of the rescuers said, “What the fuck were you doing dragging her into the bush? You were going to fucking rape her, weren’t you?” to which he replied, “Yes, what am I doing? I was going to rape her. I need help.” He said, “Kill me, hit me, shoot me. I’m sick in the head and need help. If you don’t kill me, I’ll kill myself.” He also said at one stage, “Charge me and throw away the key.” 12 This is a most unusual offence in that the offender has voluntarily abandoned his most serious criminal activity. There is no suggestion in the facts that he only did so after becoming aware of the imminent approach of the three rescuers. I am satisfied and I will sentence Mr Ayerst on the basis that he himself realised the wrongfulness of his conduct and voluntarily abandoned it. Of course, however, the offence remains a very serious one.13 Miss Schmidt was a vulnerable person. She was, as I have mentioned a couple of times, seventy-one years of age, on a street in the early hours of the morning. The offence was detaining Miss Schmidt, accompanied by actual violence, in particular that which occurred when the offender dragged Miss Schmidt some distance. There is no evidence of any significant harm being occasioned to Miss Schmidt but no doubt she was concerned at what might happen to her.14 The offender has repeated in his evidence today his deep feelings of remorse. I am satisfied that they are genuine. I am satisfied that he is truly ashamed of what he did whilst he was intoxicated. 15 The offender is twenty-eight years of age. He has a problem with substance abuse. He began drinking at the age of thirteen, after he began associating with a friend whose parents owned a pub. He soon developed a pattern of binge drinking. That led to many blackouts and what Dr Neilson says are social complications in the form of criminal charges and the loss of friendships.16 As well as his problems with alcohol, the offender has also a problem with drugs. He began smoking cannabis from the age of thirteen and abused amphetamine from the age of fifteen. He tried smoking heroin but soon gave that up. 17 The offender comes from a family who all support him. The offender has completed an apprenticeship as a sheet metal worker and has been working in the past. He was in the process of moving to Western Australia to take up employment there when the offence occurred.18 He has a criminal history, as Dr Neilson adverted to but he has never served a sentence of imprisonment and there has not been any serious offence in his past, apart from a break, enter and steal for which he received a community service order and there is a significant gap between his last offence and today when he appears for sentence.19 Not surprisingly, the offender is serving his sentence on protection. It is no longer assumed that a sentence served on protection automatically is associated with conditions of custody which are harsher than those in the general prison population, nor is it automatically assumed in every case that the entirety of an offender’s sentence will be served on protection just because the offender is on protection at the time of sentence. But in this case I am satisfied that it is highly likely that the offender will serve the entirety of his sentence on protection and it is also highly likely that this will lead to harsher conditions of custody. I have, therefore, taken this matter into account in formulating the appropriate sentence.20 Consistent with the offender’s remorse, he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so I will discount the sentence I would have otherwise imposed by 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea.21 It was submitted by Mr Healey that there are good prospects of rehabilitation and, indeed, that matter was conceded by the Crown. I cannot agree. Of course, there are some prospects of rehabilitation and, of course, there is a genuine desire on the part of the offender to never drink again and to never take drugs again but the experience of the courts is that the road ahead for people such as the offender is not an easy one, so although there are some prospects of rehabilitation I cannot say that they are good.22 A similar thing needs to be said about the likelihood of the offender re-offending. In the past he has drunk to the extent that he has committed criminal offences. His prospects of re-offending depend very much on him abandoning and overcoming his substance abuse problems.23 This is a case where there needs to be an element of personal deterrence. No doubt, the sentence I will shortly announce upon the offender will serve as a reminder to him in the event that he is tempted to consume alcohol in the future. He should remember that if he consumes alcohol and, as is quite likely, he then commits a criminal offence, he will go to gaol for a lengthy period of time.24 This was an offence which was not planned and appears to have been highly opportunistic. Whether or not he was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions is difficult to say, although I will make that finding in the offender’s favour. I make that finding because of the obvious level of the offender’s intoxication.25 It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence needs to reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct and that is a constraint on how lenient a judge can be in formulating the appropriate sentence and appropriate non-parole period. The sentence I choose must bear a reasonable relationship to the objective seriousness of the offender’s conduct. I repeat, this was a very serious offence involving the kidnapping of a vulnerable victim so that the offender could in turn commit a very, very serious offence upon her.26 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 13 May 2007 and I set a head sentence of three years. The non-parole period will expire on 12 November 2008, on which day the offender is to be released to parole.

     Brett Ronald PRITCHARD v Regina  
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
       
      
    1 HANDLEY AJA: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: I agree.  
     
      
    3 PRICE J: The applicant Brett Ronald Pritchard seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court at Penrith on 2 February 2007. 
     
      
    4 The applicant had been indicted before a jury on 1 November 2006 on one count of wound with intent to commit murder under s 27 of the Crimes Act 1900 and an alternative count of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm under s 33 of the Crimes Act. On 10 November 2006, the applicant was found “not guilty” of both charges by the jury but guilty of the statutory alternative offence of malicious wounding under s 35 of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    5 The sentencing Judge sentenced the applicant on 2 February 2007 to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months. As the sentence was to commence on 25 December 2005, the applicant is eligible for release to parole on 24 December 2008. 
     
      
    6 The application for leave to appeal identifies two grounds namely: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The Sentencing Court erred by failing to find or adequately take  
         
         into account for the purpose of assessing the applicant’s  
        
       
       objective level of criminal responsibility that the applicant acted  
       
        
         in excessive self-defence when he stabbed the victim; 
        
       
       
        
        2. That the sentence imposed was, in all circumstances, manifestly  
        
       
       excessive.  
       
      
    7 It is for present purposes necessary only to refer to the first ground of appeal.  
     
      
    8 The issue of self-defence was raised by the applicant at the trial.  
     
      
    9 During the trial, the applicant gave evidence that he was attacked by Mr Kane (Kane) who punched him in the head thee times and told him he was just getting started. The applicant said he found a kitchen knife which he held up so that Kane could see it. Kane saw the knife but seemed to get more angry and came straight towards him. A struggle then ensued. He did not actually remember stabbing Kane but had to defend himself or otherwise he was going to cop a hiding. He said he genuinely feared for his life.  
     
      
    10 Kane was stabbed three times, one stab wound severing the mammary gland resulting in the loss of a considerable quantity of blood. 
     
      
    11 Various accounts of what had occurred at the time of the stabbing were given by witnesses called by the Crown during the trial. Lisa Clifford in her evidence described the applicant screaming and throwing a wine cask into Kane’s face, then jumping on him, “having” Kane by the head until somebody screamed out he had a knife. Bianca Lee Rose recounted that the applicant threw a wine cask hitting Kane in the face, that he charged at Kane and then grabbed him by the face. She said she tried to get them apart when it was realised that the applicant had a knife. Michael Turner said that the applicant was holding Kane down on the counter with his left hand whilst the knife was in his right hand. The applicant had thrown a cask of wine and had ended up together with Kane being pinned down on the bench. Kane recounted the applicant grabbed him from behind. He said he turned around and pushed the applicant off. He asked the applicant why he was grabbing him when he next remembered looking down and feeling “warmth moist” coming from his chest. 
     
      
    12 During the proceedings on sentence, it was accepted that the Crown must have eliminated self-defence as an issue at trial by proving beyond reasonable doubt that the stabbing was not done by him in self-defence. Counsel for the applicant submitted, however, that it was not inconsistent with the verdicts that the jury accepted the applicant acted in self-defence but that in all the circumstances his self-defence was excessive. 
     
      
    13 This submission arose as the Crown could eliminate self-defence as an issue by proving beyond reasonable doubt either: 
     
      
       
        
        1. That the applicant did not believe at the time of the stabbing that it was necessary to do what he did in order to defend himself; or  
        
       
       
        
        2. If it is reasonably possible that he did have such a belief, that nevertheless the stabbing was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them.  
        
       
      
    14 During his Honour’s ex tempore remarks on sentence, the sentencing Judge said (ROS at 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “It has been suggested to me by the Crown, and indeed, in my – and that a jury could not have found that Mr Pritchard acted in self-defence. Mr Wendler has said that the evidence that the jury must have accepted was that Mr Cain (sic) was the initiator of any physical contretemps because he punched – he said the jury must have accepted that he was punched in the face by Mr Cain (sic) – that is to say, the offender was – whereas, the crown suggest that the jury must have rejected self-defence because it was, and as I noted, it was strongly put by Mr Wendler that if the jury finds that there was self-defence, that it – that he should be found not guilty to all charges, including the statutory one. Mr Wendler before me today has said that it is possible that the jury did accept that he was acting in self-defence, but his – that his self-defence over reached the degree of danger to himself and therefore, that self-defence would not have – could not be sustained. 
        
       
       
        
        I, of course, on the – I have to find, at least as well as I can, what the jury found on the basis of beyond reasonable doubt……….” 
        
       
      
    15 Although the sentencing Judge made reference to these arguments, no findings were made as to whom had been the aggressor. He did not determine whether the victim had punched the applicant and had continued to act aggressively. It appears that his Honour did not consider whether the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was not attacked and did not fear for his safety or whether it was reasonably possible that the applicant feared for his life and believed at the time it was necessary to do what he did in order to defend himself, although the stabbing was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them to be. 
     
      
    16 The finding of the relevant facts is critical to the determination of an appropriate sentence. It is the duty of the sentencing Judge to find the relevant facts: GAS v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198 [at 30] and to clearly identify during the remarks on sentence the facts found. 
     
      
    17 The finding of facts, to which I have referred, is relevant to the assessment of the applicant’s culpability for his offending. Without these facts being found and identified neither the applicant nor this Court can properly understand how the sentence imposed was arrived at. The principles of fact finding following a guilty verdict by a jury are well established: see for example R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 and do not need to be repeated here. 
     
      
    18 I propose that: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal be granted; 
       
        
         
        (ii) Appeal allowed; 
        
       
      
     (iii) Sentence quashed; 
     
      
     (iv) The matter be remitted to the sentencing Judge to hear and  determine the sentence proceedings according to law.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is a Crown appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against sentences imposed upon the respondent in relation to 14 charges of obtaining a financial benefit by deception contrary to the provisions of s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for each offence was imprisonment for a term of 5 years. The sole ground of appeal is that the sentences imposed are manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    2 The respondent pleaded guilty to the offences which were described in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “That on various dates between 17 June 2003 and 7 December 2005, at Northbridge, Winston Hills and Castle Cove, he dishonestly obtained a financial benefit from each of Nick Ross, Steven Armbrister, Keith Logan, Gerald Steinmann, Tim Kamsler, and Simon Kelly; 
        
       
       
        
        (i) Count 1: On 17 June 2003, $50,000 from Nick Ross; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Count 2: On 11 August 2003, $100,000 from Steven Armbrister; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Count 3: On 19 August 2003, $50,000 from Nick Ross; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) Count 4: On 18 December 2003, $549,722 from Nick Ross; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) Count 5: On 3 August 2004, $15,000 from Keith Logan; 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) Count 6: On 23 September 2004, $30,000 from Keith Logan; 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) Count 7: On 19 November 2004 $10,000 from Gerald Steinmann; 
        
       
       
        
        (viii) Count 8: On 1 December 2004, $211,500 from Nick Ross; 
        
       
       
        
        (ix) Count 9: On 16 March 2005, $250,000 from Nick Ross; 
        
       
       
        
        (x) Count 10: On 11 August 2003, $30,000 from Steven Armbrister; 
        
       
       
        
        (xi) Count 11: On 27 October 2005, $100,000 from Tim Kamsler; 
        
       
       
        
        (xii) Count 12: On 7 December 2005, $30,000 from Tim Kamsler; 
        
       
       
        
        (xiii) Count 13: On 8 December 2005, $35,000 from Simon Kelly; and 
        
       
       
        
        (xiv) Count 14: On 30 September 2005, $30,000 from Steven Armbrister.” 
        
       
      
    3 At the same time as he was sentenced for count 4 the respondent asked his Honour to take into account pursuant to the provisions of s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, 12 further offences of obtaining a financial benefit by deception from Nick Ross.  
     
      
    4 On 30 March 2007 the sentencing judge taking into account the further offences sentenced the respondent as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) For Count 1: a fixed term of imprisonment for 4½ months commencing on 8 June 2006 and expiring on 23 October 2006; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) For each of Counts 2 and 3: concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for 9 months commencing on 8 August 2006 and expiring on 7 March 2007; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) For Count 5: a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months commencing on 8 October 2006 and expiring on 7 April 2007; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) For Count 6: a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months commencing on 8 December 2006 and expiring on 7 June 2007; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) For Count 7: a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months commencing on 8 February 2007 and expiring on 7 August 2007; 
        
       
       
        
        (f) For Count 10: a fixed term of imprisonment for 9 months commencing on 8 April 2007 and expiring on 7 January 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        (g) For Count 8: a fixed term of 15 months commencing on 8 June 2007 and expiring on 7 September 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        (h) For Count 9: a fixed term of 15 months commencing on 8 September 2007 and expiring on 7 December 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        (i) For Count 11: a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 8 December 2007 and expiring on 7 December 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        (j) For each of Counts 12, 13 and 14: concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment for 9 months commencing on 8 February 2008 and expiring on 7 November 2008; and 
        
       
       
        
        (k) Taking into account the offences that she was asked to take into account, for Count 4: a non-parole period of 21 months commencing on 8 June 2008 and expiring on 7 March 2010 and a parole period of 15 months commencing on 8 March 2010 and expiring on 7 June 2011.” 
        
       
      
    5 The sentencing judge found special circumstances. The aggregate non-parole period fixed by her Honour for all of the offences was 3 years and 9 months and the total parole period was one year and 3 months. The total sentence was a term of 5 years. 
     
      
    6 On 14 May 2007 her Honour relisted the matter. The transcript records her Honour as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “I listed Matter because I realised when I got the remarks to correct that I hadn’t put into effect my finding of special circumstances and so I would like to well, I propose unless I am persuaded to the contrary to amend the sentence to reflect my finding of special circumstances. Do either of you wish to be heard about that?” 
        
       
      
    7 Both the prosecutor and counsel for the respondent told her Honour that they did not wish to be heard. Her Honour then proceeded to vary the sentence imposed on count 4 by reducing the non-parole period from 21 months to 16 months. This had the effect that the aggregate non-parole period was reduced from 3 years and 9 months to 3 years and 3 months with the total sentence remaining the same. 
     
      
    8 After her Honour had announced the varied sentence she was asked by the prosecutor whether her Honour had previously particularised the basis of the finding of special circumstances. Her Honour said that she had and repeated the paragraph from her remarks on sentence which said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I consider it desirable to vary the statutory ratio and extend the period of parole because of the offender’s very real need for supervision upon his release, drive, alcohol, gambling and mental health issues and the hardship occasioned to his son Lachlan by his absence.” 
        
       
      
    9 The jurisdictional basis for her Honour’s decision to vary the sentence is not clear. Although it was suggested that s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 would authorise the variation this is not immediately apparent. It may be that a slip has occurred or that the order not having been perfected the proceedings could be reopened (R v Burrell [2007] NSWCCA 79). However, it is unnecessary to resolve this question the Crown conceding that there was jurisdiction in the present case. 
     
      
    10 The Crown did not appeal against the initial sentence. It was only after the non-parole period was varied that on 24 May 2007 the Director of Public Prosecutions signed a notice of appeal under the provisions of s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act. This was almost 2 months after the original sentences were imposed. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    11 I have taken the following account of the facts from the sentencing judge’s remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) In August 2002, when he employed by Investec Bank Ltd as a financial banker, the respondent was approached by Nicholas Ross and Keith Logan for Finance to establish a national helicopter rescue programme. Although the venture did not proceed, Ross and Logan kept in friendly contact with the respondent. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Count 1: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          After the respondent had left the employ of Investec Bank Ltd in December 2002, in June 2003 he contacted Ross and told him he had done so. He told Ross that he had bought gold options worth $100,000 and offered Ross a one half interest for $50,000. On 17 June 2003 Ross decided to invest with the respondent and paid him $50,000 by cheque. The respondent deposited the cheque in a bank account held jointly with his wife and converted the proceeds for his personal use; he did not buy gold or gold options with them. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (c) Count 2: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The respondent had met Steve Armbrister in 1998 when their sons were in the same year at school; the families became close and socialised together on a weekly basis. 
          
         
         
          
          Armbrister understood that the respondent was involved in investment banking while he was employed at Investec Bank Ltd and the respondent had told him that he had left Investec Bank Ltd to engage in day trading at home. On numerous occasions in 2002 and 2003 the respondent offered Armbrister an opportunity to purchase gold options. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          As a result of those offers, on 11 August 2003 Armbrister paid the respondent $130,000 by cheques for the purchase of gold options. The respondent withdrew the funds and converted them for his personal use. He did not buy gold or gold options with them. He used $60,500 of them to pay to Ross as a return on his initial investment made on 17 June 2003. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (d) Count 3: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In mid-August 2003 the respondent told Ross that Ord Minnett, brokers, had offered him $100,000 worth of gold futures and asked him if he was interested in going fifty - fifty with  
          him in  
          the purchase of them. Believing that he had recently received a return on his original investment, and after the respondent had said that he would finance the other half, Ross decided to invest and on 19 August 2003 paid the respondent $50,000 for the purpose of investing in gold options. The respondent converted that sum to his own use and did not purchase any gold options. Ross believed that he was entering a business relationship with the respondent and asked him to put the terms of that relationship into a partnership agreement for them both to sign. On 1 September 2003 Ross and the respondent signed a document entitled ""Memorandum of Understanding"", dated that day, which the respondent represented to Ross had been drawn by a Sydney law firm. From then on Ross and the respondent communicated on a daily basis to discuss strategy for trading in gold futures and. on many occasions the respondent sent Ross a summary of transactions that: he purported to have undertaken on their behalf. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (e) Count 4: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In late 2003 the respondent told Ross that he had been offered a large number of gold options and asked if Ross was interested in funding half. Ross decided to invest the return on the sale of his house with the respondent in gold and gold options. The respondent told Ross that he had sold a property and that he had received a profit of about $400,000 on its sale. Believing that they would be making equal contributions, Ross sent the respondent $549,722 by cheque. The respondent converted that money to his personal use. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          On 24 December 2003 the respondent sent Armbrister $160,225, as a purported return on his investment out of moneys received by him in October and November 2003 from the sale of properties. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Between 23 April 2004 and 30 June 2004 Ross spoke to the respondent about setting up their relationship as a company so that they could keep relevant paperwork up to date and improve tax benefits, and the respondent said that he would set up a company in the name of NRGH Nominees Pty Ltd and open a bank account for it. Ross signed documents prepared by the respondent purportedly for this purpose. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In June 2004 Ross expressed a concern to the respondent that should the respondent die, he might have difficulty in retrieving what he believed to be his share of the trading profits and on 30 June 2004 the respondent sent Ross a copy of a letter which he said he had sent to Messrs Minter Ellison, solicitors, about amending his will in favour of Ross. He sent no such letter and Messrs Minter Ellison did not hold his will at the time. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (f) Count 5: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In August 2004 after speaking to Ross about the profit that Ross thought he was making from gold trading, Keith Logan decided to invest money in the respondent and spoke to him at Neutral Bay about participating in the scheme. The respondent told Logan that he could invest $15,000 to purchase gold for which he claimed to have options. Logan transferred $15,000 to the respondent's bank account which the respondent used for its own purposes. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (g) Count 6: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          On 23 September 2004 at a meeting at Neutral Bay, Logan paid the respondent $30,000 by cheque asking that it be invested in the share trading portfolio of Ross and the respondent. The respondent used the money for his own personal use. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (h) Count 7: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          From about 1998 the respondent and Gerald Steinmann were acquainted through the respondent's sons being in bands of which Steinmann was bandmaster; Steimmann believed that the respondent worked in the investment industry, and on regular occasions the respondent and Steinmann discussed business matters. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In October 2004 the respondent told Steinmann that he was making money investing for himself and other people and offered Steinmann the opportunity to be involved in his investment scheme. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          On 3 November 2004 by e-mail the respondent sent Steinmann an outline of his current financial trading portfolio and asked Steinmann if he wished to invest. On 19 November 2004 Steinmann paid the respondent $10,000 by cheque as an investment in the share portfolio. The respondent did not purchase options with the money. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (i) Count 8: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          On 1 December 2004, as a result of a conversation with the respondent, Ross sent him a cheque for $211,500 for the purpose of investing in further share options. The respondent converted the money for his own use and did not purchase shares with it. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          On 15 December 2004 the respondent deposited in Logan's account $5,000 obtained from other victims of his fraudulent activity. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (j) Count 9: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In late 2004 the respondent and Ross discussed the possibility of cashing in their superannuation schemes and depositing the proceeds in the NRGH and Nominees trading account. Ross believed that the proposal was to provide the share trading scheme with extra liquidity for share purchases. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          On 14 February 2005 Ross sent the respondent $250,000 from his superannuation fund by cheque payable to NRGH Nominees Pty Ltd. Since there was no bank account in that name, the cheque could not be deposited; the respondent asked for a further cheque for the same amount, and Ross provided it to the respondent. Ross understood that the respondent would use the funds to invest in share purchases. The respondent deposited the cheque in a sub account of the personal account of the respondent in 
            
          the name of the respondent and NRGH Nominees Trading which was set up on 31 March 2005 with an initial deposit of that cheque. The respondent converted the money for his personal use and did not purchase shares with it. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (k) Count 10: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          On 29 September 2005 the respondent left messages on Armbrister's telephone asking to speak to him. On 30 September 2005 the respondent told Ambrister that he had an investment opportunity in the oil options and asked Armbrister if he wished to contribute. He told Armbrister that he would have to provide the funds by 2 p.m. that day and that the scheme involved a guarantee. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Armbrister paid the respondent $30,000 in cash and by cheque. The respondent did not buy oil or oil options with the money. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (1) Count 11: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In about 2006 Tim Kamsler met the respondent through their sons being in the same class at school. Kamsler understood that the respondent was a successful market trader and they spoke about the stock market and trading in gold share. The respondent had told Kamsler that he was involved in investing shares, futures and options with Ross. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          On 26 October 2005 respondent left a message on Kamsler's mobile phone asking if he would like to invest in gold options, which, if not taken up, would lapse that day. The respondent told Kamsler that the return was about 30% over a six to seven week period with the options maturing into mid-December 2005. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Kamsler agreed to invest $100,000 and on 27 October 2005 forwarded a cheque for $100,000 to the respondent for that purpose. During a discussion about the investment later that day the respondent told Kamsler that he had enabled Armbrister, known to Kamsler, to purchase his dream home; he asked Kamsler not to speak to Armbrister because Armbrister wanted to keep the trading scheme confidential. The respondent did not purchase options of gold with the money. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (m) Count 12: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          On 7 December 2005 the respondent sent a message to Kamsler asking him if he had any more spare cash and that he had more options for a one week period with a maturity date of 14 December 2005. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Kamsler agreed to invest $30,000 and at the request of the respondent deposited that  
          sum in  
          the account of Graeme Hare, the respondent's father. The respondent converted the proceeds to his own use. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (n) Count 13: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In December 2003 Armbrister introduced Simon Kelly, a self-employed computer technician, to the respondent and over two years Kelly went often to the respondent's home to service and repair his electronic equipment. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Kelly understood from the respondent that he had retired after a successful career in finance. The respondent told Kelly that he was trading from home and making money from gambling on horses and had helped many people out of financial difficulties. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          On 7 December 2005 at his home, the respondent offered Kelly a copper option contract expiring in one month with a ""built-in upside of approximately 35%"" he told Kelly that he was going to insure the options to ensure that no loss could be incurred and that he had a capital gains loss that could be applied. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Kelly told the respondent that he had $35,000 to invest and the respondent told him he needed the answer by four o'clock the following day. The respondent told Kelly that he would take whatever share was left of the $100,000. On the following day Kelly told the respondent that he would invest in it. The respondent told Kelly that he would get Ord Minnett to email him a copy of the contract. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          At the request of the respondent Kelly deposited $35,000 into the account of the respondent's father. The respondent converted the money to his own personal use and did not purchase copper or copper options. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (o) Count 14: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          On 23 December 2005 the respondent telephoned Armbrister and told him that he had an investment opportunity in gold and guaranteed him a return on whatever he invested when the market reopened in the New Year; he told him that he would get his money back in January with a profit of 50% and that he needed cash by 2 p.m. that day. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          That day Armbrister drew $10,000 in cash and paid it to the respondent for the purpose of the best in gold. The respondent did not buy gold options with it.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    12 The further matters which the respondent asked her Honour to take into account when sentencing for count 4 were a further 12 occasions when the respondent dishonesty obtained monies from Nick Ross totalling over $850,000 by representing to him that he was making investments in which he invited him to participate, whereas in fact he was making no such investments and was applying those sums for other purposes. 
     
      
    13 The total amount by which the victims were defrauded was approximately $2 million. The respondent used part of the money obtained from his victims for the purpose of repaying monies received by him from others and at the same time telling them that the payments were returns upon their investments. The sentencing judge found that the emotional impact of the losses upon the victims would have been devastating. Her Honour found that counts 4, 8 and 9 involved a degree of planning that increased their objective seriousness. 
     
      
    14 In May 2005 the respondent told Ross that they should conclude their dealings in gold and that as a result of their profitable trading they would receive $28 million to share between them. On 23 May 2005 the respondent and Ross had a celebratory dinner and in mid-May 2005 after discussing the matter with the respondent, Ross ordered two Porsche cars for himself and his fiancée to be paid for out of the NRGH Nominees Pty Ltd account. After purchasing them Ross found that the account contained insufficient funds. The respondent sent a cheque to the vendor of the cars which released them to Ross. The cheque was dishonoured and the respondent pretended to attempt to pay the vendor for them. The vendor never received money from the respondent and Ross and his fiancée paid for them out of moneys available to them. 
     
      
    15 On 12 August 2005 Ross discovered that there were no accounts at Westpac Banking Corporation in the name of “NRGH Nominees Pty Ltd.” On 16 August 2005 as a result of civil action taken by Ross, the respondent’s assets were frozen and on 14 December 2005 the respondent, who was present, was made bankrupt in the Federal Court of Australia. Between 16 December and 22 December 2005 the respondent drew cheques in favour of Logan, and Kamsler, each of which was dishonoured. Count 14 was committed by him after the date upon which he became bankrupt. 
     
      
    16 The respondent took advantage of friendships made with the victims and obtained from each of them, and especially from Ross, substantial sums of money. He had never traded with Ord Minnett; he did not cause the incorporation of any company called NRGH Nominees Pty Ltd; he used moneys obtained by him from the victims for family and personal expenses and did not make investments as he had said he would. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    17 The respondent was aged 37 when he began these criminal activities. He had no prior convictions and the evidence before the sentencing judge disclosed that he had been a hard working family man who was active in the community. Until December 2002 he was employed in an executive position from which he earned approximately $400,000. He left this position when his employer found he was having difficulties servicing his loan which had increased to $1.5 million and was asked to repay it. To meet this obligation he sold all of the property he owned which included his own home. He nevertheless tried to maintain the lifestyle he had enjoyed when he was working. 
     
      
    18 The evidence indicates that the respondent’s difficulties resulted from a cocaine dependency together with an addiction to alcohol and problems with excessive gambling. It was suggested that his addictions had resulted from problems in his marriage and more particularly the stress of caring for a son who suffers from Asperger’s Syndrome. At the beginning of 2006 he was a patient for 5 weeks in the North Side Clinic where he was treated for depression, alcohol and cocaine dependence. He was treated by a psychiatrist who diagnosed the respondent as suffering from a mood disorder, either drug induced or an underlying bipolar mood disorder, and a pathological gambling disorder. 
     
      
    19 The evidence indicated that since his arrest the respondent has stopped using drugs and with professional help had restored his mental health. 
     
      
    20 The sentencing judge accepted that the respondent has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to reoffend. He pleaded guilty and the sentencing judge allowed a discount of 25% to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas. He had shown remorse. 
     
      
    21 A significant subjective factor and one which is of particular concern in the resolution of this appeal is the situation of the respondent’s son Lachlan. Aged 13 at the time of sentencing Lachlan suffers from Asperger’s Syndrome. This has resulted, as is not unusual in people with that condition, in Lachlan becoming socially isolated with a variety of obsessive tendencies. He has developed a strong attachment to the respondent. Since the respondent entered custody Lachlan has stopped attending school and has been diagnosed with severe depression and a dissociative disorder. The evidence indicates that these conditions were a reaction to the respondent’s absence. The ideal position for Lachlan would be if he could be with his father. Her Honour treated these circumstances as of sufficient significance to qualify as special circumstances allowing for a reduction of the non-parole period. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    22 The offences which the respondent committed were of considerable gravity. They were committed against a number of victims with whom he had formed friendships. They were committed over a considerable period of time and involved very considerable sums of money. They involved a complex of falsehoods and misrepresentations created by the respondent. There can be no doubt that the offences justified the imposition of substantial penalties (see Pont (2000) 121 A Crim R 302; Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 438). 
     
      
    23 The sentence which was appropriate for count 4 was required to reflect the further 12 offences which were to be taken into account pursuant to s 33 of the Act. (see Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. 
     
      
    24 The Crown submitted that the multiplicity of short sentences imposed by her Honour reflect a failure to fix appropriate sentences for each offence as required by Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. It was submitted that each of the individual sentences was inadequate and by providing the extent of concurrency reflected in the sentences the sentencing judge failed to properly consider questions of cumulation, concurrence and totality. It was further submitted that her Honour failed to have proper regard to the fact that there was more than one victim. 
     
      
    25 It was further submitted that her Honour had given inappropriate weight to the respondent’s subjective circumstances and failed to impose sentences that properly reflected the objective seriousness of the offences. 
     
      
    26 Particular criticisms were made of the sentencing judge’s ultimate determination of the appropriate non-parole period. On the initial sentencing occasion her Honour both found special circumstances but also said “in my view no less a custody component can be imposed in this case.” Notwithstanding that finding, after her Honour had recognised that the sentences which she had imposed did not reflect the finding of special circumstances her Honour varied the non-parole period by reducing it by 6 months. 
     
      
    27 The principles relevant to the determination of a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence are well known. In MD, BM, NA, JT [2005] NSWCCA 342; 156 A Crim R 372 I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court has, on many occasions, taken care to emphasise the principles governing appeals by the Crown. They were clearly defined by Wood CJ at CL in  
        R v Wall  
        [2002] NSWCCA 42 where his Honour said: 
         
         
          
          ‘… it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence: 
           
           
          (a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
          House v The King  
          (1936) 55 CLR 449, applies to crown appeals against sentence:  
          Dinsdale v The Queen  
          (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion as to the appropriate sentence, for that of a sentencing judge:  
          Lowndes v The Queen  
          (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error or latent or patent is shown;  
          R v Tait  
          (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388;  
          Wong & Leung v The Queen  
          (2001) 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109. 
           
           
          (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
          Malvaso v The Queen  
          (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere;  
          R v Baker  
          [2001] NSWCCA 85. 
           
           
          (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle “for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons” per Barwick CJ in  
          Griffiths v The Queen  
          (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
          Everett v The Queen  
          (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299;  
          Dinsdale v The Queen  
          (2000) 202 CLR 32, at para 61 and 62, and  
          Wong & Leung v The Queen  
          at para 109. 
           
           
          (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
          R v Allpass  
          (1993) 72 A Crim R 561,  
          R v Papazis  
          (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and  
          Wong & Leung v The Queen  
          at para 110. 
           
           
          (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less from that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
          R v Holder & Johnston  
          (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
          Dinsdale v The Queen  
          para 62.’ 
           
          
         
        Wood CJ at CL referred to  
        R v Baker  
        [2000] NSWCCA 85 where Spigelman CJ said: 
         
         
          
          ‘The authorities make it clear that Crown appeals should be rare. It may be that the present practice does not reflect that restriction, nevertheless, successful Crown appeals should be rare. This is particularly so with respect to that category of appeals in which no particular error can be identified and the sentencing process and the Crown must rely on an assertion of manifest inadequacy as a basis for a conclusion that some error of principle must have occurred.’ 
          
         
         
        In  
        Dinsdale  
        Gaudron and Gummow JJ said: 
         
         
          
          ‘In the circumstances of the present case, the question for the Court of Criminal Appeal was whether the result reached by the trial judge had been “upon the facts …. Unreasonable or plainly unjust [so that] the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law imposes in the court of first instance” was the sentence manifestly wrong’.” [22] 
          
         
        
       
      
    28 In the present case in my judgment the sentences which the sentencing judge imposed were below the appropriate range. Each of the offences was serious and deprived the victim of very considerable sums of money. They were committed over a very significant period of time and involved a complex of fraudulent representations designed to obtain monies from people who had placed their trust in the respondent. The objectives of punishing the respondent and deterring others in my view required a more significant sentence. There are decisions which, as would be expected, reflect a variety of sentences imposed for similar offences. I have included as an annexure a table of matters where the sentence imposed has been reviewed by this Court. The repetition of fraudulent acts committed by the appellant and the significant sums of money involved would mean that the appropriate sentence should have been at the higher end of this range. 
     
      
    29 However, there are two factors by which I am persuaded that this Court should not intervene. Firstly, notwithstanding that the respondent was initially sentenced on 30 March it was not until after his sentence had been varied on 14 May that an appeal was lodged. At the time the sentence was varied no submission was made to her Honour which indicated that the Crown was in any way concerned with the sentence which her Honour had imposed and no submission was put in opposition to a reduction of the non-parole period. In these circumstances the respondent was entitled to believe that the sentence which had been imposed and varied would not be challenged. These circumstances significantly increased the burden of the later Crown appeal. 
     
      
    30 The other factor is the circumstances of the respondent’s son Lachlan. Those circumstances played a significant part in the ultimate sentence, particularly the non-parole period which her Honour imposed. 
     
      
    31 In my opinion her Honour was correct to have regard to those circumstances when determining the appropriate sentence. Although I am of the opinion that the result which her Honour arrived at was excessively lenient the impact of resentencing and, in particular, increasing the non-parole period would be very considerable on Lachlan. The combination of these matters leads to the conclusion that this is a matter where the discretion of which Heydon JA spoke in R v Hernando [2002] NSWCCA 489 should be invoked and the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    32 Appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted following a trial by jury of the murder of Asha Khanna on or about 23 August 1997. The offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment (s 19(1) of the Crimes Act 1900). The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 14 years commencing on 5 March 2007 and expiring on 4 March 2021 together with a balance of term of 6 years expiring on 4 March 2027. The total sentence is a term of 20 years. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    2 There are two grounds of appeal. The first ground alleges that the trial judge erred in a direction he gave to the jury in relation to circumstantial evidence. The second ground alleges that there has been a miscarriage of justice in that, it was not upon the whole of the evidence open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. 
     
      
    3 The appellant also seeks leave to appeal in relation to this sentence on three grounds: 
     
      
       
      1. The trial judge gave insufficient weight to the fact that the appellant was diagnosed as suffering from depression. 
       
       
      2. The trial judge gave insufficient weight to the fact of delay between the time of the alleged offence and the appellant’s trial. 
       
       
      3. The sentence imposed in all the circumstances was manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      The Crown case 
       
      General matters 
       
      
    4 The Crown case was circumstantial. It was alleged that the appellant murdered the deceased after she arrived home at her unit after leaving work as a nurse at Liverpool hospital at 11.30 pm on 22 August 1997. She lived alone and her home was a short distance from her place of employment.  
     
      
    5 The Crown alleged that the appellant was admitted by the deceased to her unit where he either smothered her or strangled her with a soft ligature. It was alleged that he then covered her head in a plastic bag, wrapped her body completely in heavy duty plastic garbage bags, tied them together, covered her with a doona and closed her bedroom door which he sealed with a towel to stop decomposition odours emanating from the bedroom. 
     
      
    6 The Crown alleged that the appellant then took the deceased’s Commonwealth Bank mastercard and debit card from her unit and at 4.04 am attempted to use it to obtain money from an automatic teller machine (“ATM”) at the Commonwealth Bank branch at Liverpool. The card was rejected. Another attempt was made at 4.05 am and the card was again rejected. The Crown alleged that the appellant then returned to the deceased’s flat, obtained access to her personal identification number (“PIN”) and at 4.33 am returned to the same Commonwealth Bank branch and retrieved $500 from the ATM. Further attempts were made at 4.34 am to retrieve $500 but it was rejected, 4.35 am to retrieve $300 but it was rejected. At 4.36 am a successful attempt was made to retrieve $200. 
     
      
    7 The appellant did not attend work on 22 August 1997. In his ERISP he said he took his daughter Charishma to their local general practitioner, Dr Gregory Natale, that day as she had a sprained ankle. Dr Natale’s records show that he treated the appellant’s daughter for a sprained ankle on 21 October 1997 and not 22 August. However, the doctor’s records show that on 22 August 1997 he did treat the girl for a viral upper respiratory tract infection.  
     
      
    8 The Crown alleged that the appellant later went to a number of clubs where he “laundered” the monies he had obtained by putting them into poker machines and then obtaining a cash payment for the credit balance. I have attached to these reasons a schedule which details the withdrawals from various ATMs and the occasions on which the appellant obtained a payout from a licensed club. 
     
      
    9 The Crown alleged that the appellant withdrew the entire credit balance from the deceased’s account, approximately $13,000 over the ten days following her death. The last withdrawal was made on 1 September 1997 in the sum of $20. 
     
      
    10 When the deceased’s credit card was used in Commonwealth Bank ATMs on 23 August 1997 and 24 August 1997 CCTV footage was recorded. The police extracted still photographs from that footage which were tendered in evidence. The police also carried out covert surveillance of the appellant and photographs were taken of him in September 1997 which were also tendered in evidence. The appellant was arrested for an entirely separate offence in November 1998 and was also photographed at Liverpool Police Station at that time. These early photographs were important because the appellant’s trial did not take place until this year. The Crown case was that the person in the CCTV footage and the person in the surveillance and other material was one and the same. 
     
      
    11 This Court has examined the photographs and I shall consider them when considering the appellant’s submission that the Crown failed to exclude other possible killers of the deceased. 
     
      
    12 The schedule to these reasons reveals occasions when the appellant attended at licensed clubs and received a payout on that day. It also demonstrates that the deceased’s credit card was used to retrieve money from an ATM at the club on the same day. There are also occasions where, although the credit card was used in an ATM at the club, the evidence does not confirm the appellant’s presence at the club premises at that time. The appellant accepted that he was not at work on any occasion when the credit card was used. 
     
      
    13 There was evidence that the appellant had pawned a camera which had previously been purchased by the deceased. It was the Crown case that the camera had been stolen by the appellant who later pawned it without realising that it may be traced to the deceased. 
     
      
    14 There was a daily amount that limited withdrawals from the deceased’s accounts. Steven McShane, Investigations Manager with the Commonwealth Bank, gave evidence that the maximum amount that could be withdrawn from the deceased’s account at the Commonwealth Bank ATMs was a total of $800 per day. 
     
      
       
      Cause of death 
       
      
    15 The appellant put in issue whether the deceased had been murdered or whether she had died from natural causes. Although last seen on 22 August her body was not discovered until 9 September. 
     
      
    16 The post mortem examination was carried out by Dr Bogdan Hulewicz, a forensic pathologist. He attended at the scene. The doctor was medically unfit at trial and his post mortem report and evidence at the inquest was read by the trial judge to the jury. In his report he said that apart from a small superficial cut on the right index finger of the deceased, there were no obvious injuries or marks of violence and there was no evidence of pre-existing disease. There was no evidence of the presence of projectiles or any metallic objects. However, toxicological analysis detected the anti-malarial drug, Chloroquine in the deceased’s liver. The doctor stated that the cause of death was not capable of being ascertained in the absence of any evidence of injury or disease. 
     
      
    17 At the coronial inquest Dr Hulewicz had given evidence that the possible causes of death were suffocation or smothering both of which would leave minimal signs or changes to the body. Because of the time between death and the post mortem examination the decomposition of the body would mean that any minimal signs of injury would have been destroyed. The doctor excluded head injury or manual strangulation as there were no skull fractures, no brain injury and there were no fractures to the voice box. 
     
      
    18 The deceased suffered from systemic lupus erythematosus, commonly known as lupus, a condition in which tissues and cells are damaged by the body’s immune system. She was first diagnosed with this condition in 1994. According to the deceased’s medical records she was first treated for the condition with Prednisone and her medication was then changed to Plaquenil. The evidence suggested that the deceased’s lupus, which affected her kidneys, was under control. In a report dated 15 October 1996 Dr Kenneth Howlin, a consultant renal physician, said that he was pleased with the deceased’s progress. In 1996 it was reported that she was well and tolerating the Plaquenil without major problems. 
     
      
    19 The deceased was a nurse which the Crown argued would have ensured that she would have been careful with her medication. Evidence from the quantity of tablets found at the deceased’s unit compared to the date of her prescription suggested that she had been taking her medication responsibly. It was submitted that the possibility that the deceased’s lupus condition had caused her death could be excluded. 
     
      
    20 The anti-malarial drug Chloroquine and metabolites, hydroxychloroquine, were detected in the deceased’s liver at a rate of 230 mg/kg. This can be compared with the evidence which indicated that the toxic range was at least as wide as 71 mg/kg to 724 mg/kg and fatal range from 150 mg/kg to 900 mg/kg. The scientist who carried out the toxicological analysis gave evidence that the certificate was incorrect and that he did not detect any chloroquine but only metabolites of chloroquine in particular hydroxychloroquine and desethyl-chloroquine. The evidence indicated that when carrying out a quantitative analysis for hydroxychloroquine it is necessary to use a certified reference material. The laboratory which carried out the analysis did not possess a certified reference material. The evidence indicated that chloroquine was wrongly used as the certified reference material and accordingly, although hydroxychloroquine and desethyl-chloroquine were found in the liver, the quantitative analysis did not allow identification of their amounts. 
     
      
    21 Evidence was given by Bruce Tattam, a chemist and manager of the Mass Spectrometry Analytical Facility in the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sydney. He said that it would not be an acceptable scientific method to use chloroquine to assess the quantity of hydroxychloroquine which was present. He said that if you did that it could give you an invalid result. The true result could be higher or lower. 
     
      
    22 Professor Graham Starmer, the Honorary Associate Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Sydney was asked about testing quantitatively for hydroxychloroquine by using chloroquine. Professor Starmer said “it is wrong … because if you need to measure what you are looking to measure. You can’t compare one chemical with another. He should have got an authenticated sample of hydroxychloroquine to use as his standard.” 
     
      
    23 Professor Starmer said that the taste of Plaquenil or hydroxychloroquine was extremely bitter and side effects of an overdose would be sedation and drowsiness and later cardiac disturbances which can be fatal. He also said you could get a build up of toxicity over weeks or months. However, the Plaquenil found at the unit of the deceased showed that 61 tablets were taken over a period of 64 days. The prescribed therapeutic dose was one per day. 
     
      
    24 In response to the Crown case the appellant submitted at his trial, and to this Court, that the possibility that the deceased had died from lupus or from the effects of hydroxychloroquine could not be excluded. It was suggested that the person using the deceased’s credit card may have come upon her in circumstances where the deceased had already passed away and in an endeavour to delay the time at which the body would be discovered, to allow an opportunity to exploit the credit card, had made the arrangements to cover the body and seal the bedroom door. It was submitted that the deceased may have died without the intervention of a third party, or there may have been another person who killed her, even if it was the appellant who exploited her credit card. 
     
      
       
      Analysing the schedule of withdrawals from deceased’s bank account and poker machine payouts 
       
      
    25 As I have indicated the records reveal that the person using the deceased’s credit card accessed the Commonwealth Bank ATM on the morning of 23 August 1997. The appellant received a poker machine payout at 1.09 pm on the same afternoon at the Mt Pritchard Community Club. This was for the sum of $500. The payout voucher from the Club signed by the appellant was in evidence. The type of payment is recorded as C/C. This means that the payout is not from a jackpot but is from a credit balance. A cancelled credit payout can be obtained by depositing money in the machine and then collecting it by hitting the “collect” button, obtaining a voucher from the gaming supervisors and then collecting the equivalent cash from the change booths. It was the Crown case that the appellant was laundering the money he had withdrawn that morning by depositing it in the machine and thereafter claiming the credit balance. 
     
      
    26 On the same day, 23 August 1997, the appellant went to the Auburn RSL club. On that day two amounts of $300 were withdrawn from the deceased’s account at 3.24 pm and 3.34 pm. At 4.04 pm the appellant received a poker machine payout for the sum of $300 from the club. The type of payout is nominated as cancelled credit and not a jackpot. 
     
      
    27 The evidence indicated that on this day the appellant took his daughter to coaching in Strathfield between 3 pm and 5 pm. Accordingly, it was submitted that it could not have been the appellant who used the credit card at 2.44 pm. However, there was no evidence of the time at which the appellant took his daughter to her class and it is conceivable that she had been taken earlier than the starting time. Furthermore, there is no evidence that he delivered his daughter on time. 
     
      
    28 On the following day, 24 August 1997, the deceased’s credit card is used to withdraw $500 from the Commonwealth Bank at Liverpool at 12.29 am. It is then used at 12.42 am at the Mt Pritchard Community Club to withdraw $200. An unsuccessful attempt was made to withdraw a further $200 at 1.40 am. At 3.07 am the credit card is used to withdraw $700 from the Commonwealth Bank at Liverpool. 
     
      
    29 On 25 August 1997 at 12.03 am an enquiry is made using the credit card at the Commonwealth Bank at Liverpool with respect to the balance of the account. An amount of $700 is then withdrawn from the account. At 10.51 am a withdrawal is made through the ATM at the Mt Pritchard Community Club for the sum of $400. At 11.14 am on that day the appellant received a poker machine payout of $600 and at 11.44 am a further payout of $500. The vouchers indicate that both payouts were for cancelled credit. 
     
      
    30 At 12.12 pm a withdrawal is made using the credit card from the club’s AMT for $400. At 12.35 pm there is a further payout of $500. This was also for a cancelled credit. At 1.16 pm and 1.17 pm, there were two unsuccessful attempts to withdraw $400 each time. 
     
      
    31 The schedule shows further attempts to utilise the credit card, some of which were unsuccessful but most of which were successful. On 26 August 1997 the credit card was used at the Commonwealth Bank in Westfield at Liverpool and at the John Edmondson Memorial Club, the second occasion being at 11.31 am. The appellant obtained a payout of $600 from the club at 12.08 pm. The credit card was again used at the club at 12.30 pm. The appellant obtained a further payout of $1000 at 1.25 pm. The payout vouchers indicated that the payouts were for cancelled credit. 
     
      
    32 On 27 August 1997 the credit card was used at the John Edmondson Memorial Club to obtain a total of $1,500 between 10.02 am and 10.21 am. At 1.09 pm the appellant obtained a payout of a $1,000. The voucher was noted by the code indicating cancelled credit. Later that afternoon, there were two failed attempts to withdraw $300 and $200. 
     
      
    33 On 28 August 1997 the deceased’s credit card was used to obtain money from an ATM at the John Edmondson Memorial Club. A total of $1600 was obtained between 12.32 pm and 12.42 pm. At 12.51 pm and 2.15 pm the appellant obtained payouts totalling $1,000. The vouchers for these payouts were noted by the code indicating cancelled credit. 
     
      
    34 Monies were withdrawn from the ATM at the John Edmondson Memorial Club on 29 August 1997 but there is no record of the appellant receiving any poker machine payouts. 
     
      
    35 The credit card was used at the Fairfield RSL Club ATM on 30 August 1997. The appellant obtained poker machine payouts of $1,200 at 1.40 am on that day and a further payout of $300 at 2.47 am. Both payouts were cancelled credits. The following day on 31 August 1997 and thereafter on 1 September 1997 money was obtained from the ATM at the Fairfield RSL Club and the Mt Pritchard Community Club. However, there is no record of the appellant being present on that day or obtaining a payout. 
     
      
    36 The appellant gave an ERISP interview during which he was asked about the maximum amount that he would put into a poker machine. He answered that he would normally put in $5, $10 but $20 as his maximum to play. He said that he had received jackpots of the order of $100 or $50 but none bigger than that. The evidence of the payouts which he in fact received from the various clubs on different occasions is entirely inconsistent with these answers. The appellant was asked about the poker machine payouts coinciding with withdrawals from the deceased’s accounts. His response was that someone must have been following him and that another person who had used the cards must have been there when he was in the club. 
     
      
       
      Deceased’s phone calls on 22 August 1997 
       
      
    37 Mira Kosijer worked with the deceased at Liverpool Hospital. During the shift between 3 pm and 11 pm on 22 August 1997 the deceased used the phone in the nurses station. Miss Kosijer said this was at about 3 pm. Apparently the deceased was unable to reach the person she was telephoning and rang Telecom for assistance. Miss Kosijer made a joke to the deceased about the phone number which she had overheard the deceased repeating to the Telecom operator. Miss Kosijer recognised the first numbers as being Liverpool numbers (9821 or 9826). Other evidence revealed that the appellant was not at work at this time and that his home phone number began with the numbers 9601. The appellant accordingly suggested that the deceased had not been ringing him at this time. 
     
      
    38 Miss Kosijer gave evidence that at about 8 pm on the same day the deceased again made a telephone call. She spoke to someone in what appeared to be “in her Indian language.” She had apparently also tried to use the telephone at 7.30 pm but could not get through. 
     
      
    39 At about 9.30 pm the deceased asked Miss Kosijer if she could help with swapping her afternoon shift the next day. Miss Kosijer was not able to assist and suggested she ask other nurses whether they could help. When the deceased did not show up for work the next day (and she had apparently not managed to change her shift) Miss Kosijer rang her at home but there was no answer. 
     
      
    40 Miss Kosijer described the deceased as being very reticent on 22 August and appeared desperate to have the following day off. She said of her that she was “physically with us but mentally she was far away.” Miss Kosijer said it was after the phone call in the evening that the deceased’s behaviour began to change. 
     
      
       
      Telephone call to Liverpool Hospital 
       
      
    41 On 23 August 1997 a telephone call was made to Liverpool Hospital where the deceased worked as a nurse. The caller said that the deceased had had to leave suddenly for India as her mother was sick and she would not be back for 2 weeks. It was the Crown case that this telephone call was made by the appellant for the purpose of explaining the deceased’s absence and allowing sufficient time for him to utilise her credit card without being detected. 
     
      
    42 Mr John Acs gave evidence of this phone call at the trial. He said he received a telephone call at Liverpool Hospital between 1.30 and 2.00 pm on 23 August 1997. The caller would not give his name. Mr Acs described the caller’s voice as being male, middle aged, over 35 and with an Indian accent. He later said it was a Malaysian/Indian accent. He said that he had never heard the voice of the caller before but had worked with Indian doctors and nurses from Malaysia and the caller sounded like the people he had worked with who were Indians – particularly Malaysian Indians as opposed to Indians from India. The suggestion was made that Mr Richard Naidu made this call. I discuss that matter in detail below.  
     
      
       
      Deceased’s camera 
       
      
    43 The evidence disclosed that the appellant sold a Canon camera to the Cash Converters store at Liverpool on 3 November 1997 about 11 weeks after the last sighting of the deceased. Police saw the camera at Cash Converters on 26 November 1997. Documentation at the deceased’s unit disclosed that the camera and a lens had been purchased by her and that a warranty card had been completed. It was the Crown case that the appellant took the camera on the night he murdered the deceased. 
     
      
    44 The appellant gave an explanation for his possession of the camera during his ERISP interview. He said that he purchased it for $50 from a Fijian Indian man “a couple of years ago” at the Railway Station Hotel, Liverpool. He said that he intended to give it to some relatives in India when he visited, but sold it as he needed money for some car repairs. 
     
      
       
      ERISP interview of appellant’s wife 
       
      
    45 The appellant’s wife gave an ERISP interview on 12 November 1997. During the interview a number of questions were asked of her about her husband, the clubs he attended and his personal appearance, including whether he wore a moustache. She indicated that she herself knew the deceased, they attended a prayer group together, and that the appellant had met her on one occasion at their home in June or July 1997. 
     
      
    46 The appellant listened to the cassette recording of this interview and discussed it with his wife. Accordingly, he became aware that the police were interested in him as a suspect in relation to the murder. During his own ERISP interview he initially denied knowing the contents of the interview with his wife. However, he did agree that his wife had received a copy of the cassette of the interview and was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you listen to that? 
         
        A. No sir.” 
        
       
      
    47 He was later informed that the police had installed listening devices at his home. He then admitted that he had heard the contents of the ERISP with his wife. He was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Tell me about listening to the cassette? 
         
        A. Yeah, I listened to the question about what you asked my wife.” 
        
       
      
    48 The Crown relied on this evidence as a lie evidencing a consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
       
      Anonymous letter sent to police 21 November 1997 
       
      
    49 On 21 November 1997, nine days after the appellant’s wife was interviewed, a hand written letter was sent to Liverpool police station with information about the deceased’s death. The letter was transcribed and read to the jury. It reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sir 
        
       
       
        
        I wish to bring the following to your attention regarding the death of Mrs Asha Khanna of Liverpool. I came to Australia about ten year back, some years back and meet Mr Chaman Lal Khanna at Parramatta and we become very good friends. I often go to their home at 13 Auburn Road, Parramatta and meet his wife, Mrs Asha Khanna, as I also come from north part of India. After some time Mr and Mrs Khanna had a fight and Mrs Khanna changed house to Bankstown. 
        
       
       
        
        On 22nd of August Mr Chaman Lal Khanna take me to Liverpool at 11.00 pm. He say to me he want to speak to her about money and house in India. Mrs Khanna come back from work at 11.30 pm and park her car in the garage, Mr Khanna go and speak to her and both of them go into the house and I was sitting in the car outside, at 12.15am Mr Khanna come down and sit in the car and say to me that Mrs Khanna is dead. Mr Khanna say to me that they have a [sic] argument about house in India and Mrs Khanna go to the phone to call police when Mr Khanna punch her in the head and he say she fall down and die because she was a sick womenen [sic] he bring her bank card and her house key we go to the Commonwealth Bank and withdraw money from her account. 
        
       
       
        
        On 23rd we come back at midnight and Mr Chaman Lal Khanna go into the house with the keys. He come back after one hour and say to me not to worry because he clean all finger print and covered the body and no one will find out for many days. He give me her bank card and pin number and say to me take the money in the account and not say a word about this to anyone. He say to me to draw the money in Liverpool area clubs and ATM machines. I withdraw the money out Liverpool RSL, Mt Pritchard club, Fairfield RSL, Auburn RSL and local ATM machines at Liverpool. 
        
       
       
        
        On the day the police find the body of Mrs Khanna I contact Mr Khanna and he say to me not to worry but two weeks back when I see the sketch of the person wanted by the police on TV and local paper I become very afraid [sic]. I know one I get caught and I go to gaol for not reporting the death to police and taking money from the bank account. This will bring bad name to my father and mother in India so I decided to go back to India. 
        
       
       
        
        When you get this letter next week I will no longer be in Australia. Mr Chaman Lal Khanna does not know my address in India. Sir, I am very sorry for not having reported the death of Mrs Khanna and for taking her money. I have no job and no future in Australia so I go back. I wish to say sorry again sir.” 
        
       
      
    50 The Crown emphasised that the letter contained information which was not generally known to the deceased’s friends. It was not commonly known that she had ever been married or that her husband was named Chaman Lal Khanna. It was also not known that they lived at 13 Auburn Street, Parramatta and that she had come to Australia in 1986, ten years before her death. The police had released information to the media that the deceased had arrived home about 11.30 pm but had not told the media that entry was gained without force nor that the deceased had met her death shortly after. The police had also not told the media that the deceased’s credit card was taken or where the card had been utilised nor that the person accessing the card knew her PIN. 
     
      
       
      Other suspects – Chaman Lal Khanna and Richard Naidu 
       
      
    51 The anonymous letter sent to the police on 21 November 1997 implicated the former husband of the deceased, Chaman Lal Khanna, as the murderer and another man, who was the writer of the letter, as the person who accessed the bank accounts of the deceased. The Crown said this letter was written by the appellant to divert attention away from himself. 
     
      
    52 Chaman Lal Khanna married the deceased, who was his second wife, in an arranged marriage in 1986. He had been living in Australia since 1972 and worked as a teacher at Auburn Girls High School. When the deceased came to Australia they lived together at his home in Parramatta as man and wife for two weeks and then she moved into a separate bedroom. When the deceased obtained work as a nurse at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, she moved into the nurses’ hostel. He said she first came to Australia in October 1986 and moved into the nurses’ hostel in late January or early February the following year. At her request he took her belongings in a suitcase and delivered it to the reception desk at the hostel. 
     
      
    53 Mr Khanna and the deceased were divorced in 1987 or 1988 and he gave evidence that he had never seen her again. She made no claim on him for maintenance or property settlement. He said that he did not know where she lived or where she worked at the time of her death. He denied that the letter written on 21 November 1997 was in his handwriting or that he went to the deceased’s unit and punched her head, as alleged in the letter. He denied murdering the deceased. 
     
      
    54 It was also suggested that the deceased may have been murdered by Richard Naidu. Mr Naidu is of Malaysian/Indian origin. He had been previously arrested by police on 30 January 1996 in relation to a domestic complaint. On that occasion he was arrested by Const Stephen Pretty who filled out a COPS entry in which he said that the offender had no facial hair. As I have indicated the person using the deceased’s credit card had a moustache. Although Const Pretty said on 16 September 1997 in a statement to the police that Mr Naidu had a moustache, when giving evidence at the trial he said the original COPS entry was correct. An ERISP was also conducted with Mr Naidu on 30 January 1996 and still photographs taken at that time show that he did not have a moustache. 
     
      
    55 Mr Naidu gave evidence in which he said he had never had a moustache. He said he knew the deceased as he had worked with her for a time at Liverpool Hospital until 1995 when he left. He said that he did not know where she lived. He denied telephoning Liverpool Hospital on 23 August 1997 and saying that the deceased would be away for 2 weeks as she had gone to India. He also denied that he was the person in the photographs taken at the Commonwealth Bank ATM on 23 and 24 August 1997. Mr Naidu was having an affair with another nurse at Liverpool Hospital when he was employed there. This resulted in separation and divorce from his wife who he said he rarely spoke to. He said that relations between them were cool.  
     
      
    56 Mr Naidu’s wife gave evidence. She said that she was divorced from him in 2001. She was shown the photographs of the person at the Commonwealth Bank ATM on 23 and 24 August 1997 and said they were not her former husband. She said that her former husband had never worn a moustache from the time she met him in 1972 until their divorce. 
     
      
    57 Evidence was also given by Robert Davies, who was a nurse at Liverpool Hospital when Mr Naidu worked there. He said that Mr Naidu had a moustache at least part of the time he worked with him. He said that the moustache he remembered was thick and black, sort of like Saddam Hussein’s. He agreed that he gave evidence for the first time of Mr Naidu wearing a moustache at the inquest in December 2003. He agreed with the Crown Prosecutor that when he gave his statement to the police on 10 September 1997 there was no reference to Mr Naidu having a moustache. 
     
      
    58 Shermon Naidu, the son of Richard Naidu, said he had never seen his father with a moustache. He said that the photographs taken at the Commonwealth Bank ATM were not photographs of his father. He said they were not even close. Two driver’s licences and eight photographs of Mr Naidu were tendered at the trial. They ranged over many years. None of these showed him wearing a moustache. 
     
      
       
      Ground One: His Honour erred in his direction in relation to circumstantial evidence 
       
      
    59 In his summing up, the trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Circumstantial evidence is evidence of the character which the name suggests. That is to say the crown sets out to try and prove a series of circumstances, which when placed together will convince you beyond reasonable doubt of what the crown must prove, namely the guilt of the accused. Circumstantial evidence can be contrasted with what may be called direct evidence … 
        
       
       
        
        When you are dealing with a circumstantial case, it is important that you should understand that before you can return a verdict of guilty you must be satisfied that the circumstances altogether considered there can be no rational conclusion other than the guilt of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    60 The appellant makes no complaint about these directions. However, his Honour continued saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “In other words, if there is a reasonable possibility upon the whole of the circumstances proved then the accused is not guilty, then he is entitled to the benefit of that circumstance and is entitled to a verdict of not guilty at your hands. It is really just another way of saying of what I have said to you several times now that the crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    61 The appellant submitted that this direction had a tendency to confuse the jury “as they may have thought that it was necessary for them to be able to infer that a circumstance, the subject of such a rational conclusion, in fact occurred before relying on, or making allowance for, the possibility of such a circumstance.” The appellant relied upon R v McIntyre [2000] NSWCCA 6; (2000) 111 A Crim R 211. 
     
      
    62 In McIntyre the appellant was charged with breaking and entering and maliciously damaging a property by fire. The defence case was that there was a reasonable possibility that someone else could have been the offender. Hulme J emphasised that when consideration was being given to whether there was a reasonable possibility that someone else could have been the offender it was not necessary for the jury to be able to infer that the hypothesis actually occurred (at [31]). The appellant submitted that the direction given by the trial judge in the present case may have been misunderstood by the jury who may have believed that, rather than being a possibility, they may have been required to conclude that the possible event occurred before they could have regard to it when determining the appellant’s guilt. 
     
      
    63 In my judgment the submission must be rejected. I do not accept that the jury could have been misled into believing that the hypothetical possibility must be proved. They were merely told to examine the whole of the circumstances. In the immediately preceding sentence to that complained of by the appellant the trial judge reminded the jury that they had to conclude that there was “no rational conclusion other than the guilt of the accused” before they could return a guilty verdict. In order to further explain this concept his Honour made the remarks now complained of. 
     
      
    64 Elsewhere in his summing up his Honour spoke of the nature of a circumstantial case. He repeated on a number of occasions that the onus of proof rests upon the Crown which is required to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour also directed the jury that an essential component of the Crown case was that it was the appellant who was using the ATMs on each of the occasions that have been photographed. In this respect his Honour gave the jury a Shepherd direction (see Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573). His Honour further said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The nature of a circumstantial case is such that you can only draw the ultimate inference of adverse finding against the accused if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there is no other rational inference available from the whole of the evidence other than that the guilt of the accused. Unless the evidence so satisfies you, then it is your duty to bring in a verdict of not guilty.” 
        
       
      
    65 The direction complained of and the other directions to which I have referred were given to the jury by the trial judge on the afternoon of Tuesday 27 February 2007. The matter was then adjourned to the following day when his Honour gave the jury further directions. On this occasion his Honour directed particular attention to the evidence in the case and the submissions made by trial counsel. In relation to the cause of the deceased’s death his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown argument in this case is that you would reject the other postulated possibilities of death by reason of lupus or death by reason of a lethal build up of hydroxychloroquine. If it is, of course, necessary for you to reject those as possibilities before this case even gets to first base. In other words if, as a result of your finding and deliberation upon the evidence in particular, I would refer to the evidence of Dr Hulewicz and Dr Duflou, you were unable to exclude as reasonable possibilities the death of the deceased by one or other of the disease or the ingestion of what has been called the malaria type drug then necessarily the Crown case would fail because it has not established the first element of the ingredients of the crime.” 
        
       
      
    66 These were concise directions as to the way in which the jury was to approach the evidence in relation to the cause of death of the deceased. The jury were reminded in clear terms that they had to reject possibilities which were inconsistent with the appellant being the killer before the Crown case got “to first base.” 
     
      
    67 Later his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I have pointed out to you, if the Crown has to prove something beyond reasonable doubt then if there exists a possibility to the contrary it is a matter of pure logic that proof beyond reasonable doubt has not been attained.” 
        
       
      
    68 His Honour then proceeded to deal with the arguments of counsel for the appellant. 
     
      
    69 Even if I was persuaded that the direction of which the appellant complains was confusing, and I am not, I am satisfied that the further directions provided the jury with a clear understanding of the manner in which it was to approach its task. 
     
      
    70 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground two: There has been miscarriage of justice in that, the verdicts of the jury are unsafe and unsatisfactory, as it was not upon the whole of the evidence, open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty 
       
      
    71 Although previously the expression “unsafe and unsatisfactory” was used when describing this ground it is now usual to describe it by reference to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Section 6(1) provides that a verdict of guilty should be set aside “on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.” The ultimate question for determination is “whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.” (M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494-495; MFA v The Queen (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [25] and [55]). 
     
      
    72 I summarised the principles for determining whether a jury’s verdict is unreasonable in R v Habib [2005] NSWCCA 223 at [48]-[56]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 6(1) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act  
        provides as follows: 
         
         
          
          ‘The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
          
         
         
        Although the application of the section has at times proved troublesome it was authoritatively considered by the High Court in  
        MFA v The Queen  
        (2002) 213 CLR 606,  
        M v The Queen  
        (1994) 181 CLR 487 and  
        Jones v The Queen  
        (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 493. 
         
         
        There are two joint judgments in  
        MFA.  
        Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ state that when the issue is whether the verdict of a jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported the test to be applied is that stated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in  
        M: 
         
         
          
          ‘Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.’ 
          
         
         
        … 
         
         
        In  
        MFA  
        the High Court was concerned with whether the analysis of the facts of a trial by this Court was appropriate. In carrying out the appellate task the joint judgment emphasised that it was relevant to identify whether the evidence in the Crown case was ""cogent and unequivocal, and it was not inherently implausible""[30]. The relevant question is whether ""it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt"" [36]. 
         
         
        In  
        MFA,  
        McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ joined in a separate judgment. Their Honours emphasised that it was important to focus on the language of s 6(1) which because of the inclusion of the word ""unreasonable"" ""seems to state a very broad test""[47]. However, their Honours point out that the seeming amplitude is to be restricted by the context. Being a verdict of a jury which is given a special place in the law to set it aside involves ""a serious step""[49]. The requirement of the section is that the court must determine whether there has been a ""miscarriage of justice"" notwithstanding that the jury has returned a guilty verdict. 
         
         
        Embracing the test adopted by the majority of the court in  
        M  
        the joint judgment stated: 
         
         
          
          ‘Instead of asking whether the jury 'must' or were 'bound to' have a reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt, the majority posed the question whether it was 'open to the jury' to be satisfied of the accused's guilt, applying the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, acting as a reasonable jury and reaching their verdict 'upon the whole of the evidence' [55]. 
           
          
         
        The joint judgment offered the following by way of guidance: 
         
         
          
          ‘The majority in  
          M 
           pointed out that '[i]n most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced'. In such a case of doubt, it is only where the jury's advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence can explain the difference in conclusion about the accused's guilt that the appellate court may decide that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: 
           
           
          'If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a  
          significant possibility  
          that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence'[56]. 
           
          
         
        In their conclusion their Honours acknowledge that it is not uncommon for some aspects of the evidence in a trial to be less than wholly satisfactory although juries are usually well able to evaluate conflicts and imperfections of evidence. ""In the end, the appellate court must ask itself whether it considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred authorising and requiring its intervention"" [96]. 
        
       
      
    73 The Crown case was, as I have already related, circumstantial. The jury were required to consider all of the evidence. That evidence is not to be considered piecemeal (The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13 at [48]). 
     
      
    74 In Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573, Dawson J (with whom Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed) said at 580: 
     
      
       
        
        “In Chamberlain [(1983) 153 CLR 521] Gibbs CJ and Mason J accept that evidence may have a cumulative effect and point out that it is the duty of the jury to consider all the facts together at the conclusion of the case. They say: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘At the end of the trial the jury must consider all the evidence, and in doing so they may find that one piece of evidence resolves their doubts as to another. For example, the jury, considering the evidence of one witness by itself, may doubt whether it is truthful, but other evidence may provide corroboration, and when the jury considers the evidence as a whole they may decide that the witness should be believed. Again, the quality of evidence of identification may be poor, but other evidence ma support its correctness; in such a case the jury should not be told to look at the evidence of each witness ‘separately in, so to speak, a hermetically sealed compartment’, they should consider the accumulation of the evidence.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Gibbs CJ and Mason J apply the same principle to circumstantial evidence, saying that ‘in a case depending on circumstantial evidence, the jury should not reject one circumstance because, considered alone, no inference of guilt can be drawn from it.’ They continue: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It follows from what we have said that the jury should decide whether they accept the evidence of a particular fact, not by considering the evidence directly relating to that fact in isolation, but in the light of the whole evidence, and that they can draw an inference of guilt from a combination of facts, none of which viewed alone would support that inference.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    75 To my mind the Crown case was compelling and the jury were entitled to accept, to the requisite standard that it was the appellant that killed the deceased. The challenge to that finding was argued on a number of bases. I consider each of them in turn. 
     
      
       
      The cause of death 
       
      
    76 The appellant emphasised that Dr Duflou was unable to confirm the cause of death of the deceased. His examination of the deceased could not exclude the possibility that the deceased died from lupus or from hydroxychloroquine.  
     
      
    77 Notwithstanding this evidence the physical evidence at the scene was compelling. The deceased had been wrapped in heavy duty garbage bags and was lying on her bed. A towel had been placed at the opening below the door. As a consequence there could be no doubt that at a time at least proximate to her death there had been human intervention. It was suggested by the appellant that this may have involved a person who came upon the scene after the deceased had died and in order to delay the discovery of her body had wrapped it in plastic bags and sealed the door. It was suggested that this person’s intention was to use the credit card which he or she had stolen and delay for as long as possible, the detection of the deceased’s body which would lead to inquiries being made about her bank account. 
     
      
    78 There is nothing in the evidence to support this suggestion. There was no evidence of any forced entry of the deceased’s premises with the consequence that it was reasonable to assume that the other person was admitted to the premises by the deceased. There was evidence that the deceased was careful about her dealings with strange men and accordingly it is reasonable to conclude that the person was someone whom she already knew. 
     
      
    79 The medical evidence was consistent with the possibility that the deceased was suffocated or smothered. Although the deceased was suffering from lupus the medical evidence did not suggest that this was likely to have caused her death. Having regard to her apparent careful use of her medication, poisoning from hydroxychloroquine can be discounted. In my opinion any view that the deceased died other than at the hand of a murderer could not reasonably be sustained. 
     
      
       
      Accessing the deceased’s bank account 
       
      
    80 The trial judge impressed on the jury the necessity of them being satisfied that the appellant was the person who accessed the deceased’s bank account. To my mind there can be no doubt that the jury were entitled to reach this conclusion. Although it cannot be demonstrated that the appellant was present at a club on each occasion the credit card was used there were a number of occasions when the card was used at a time when it could be established that at about that time the appellant was present. On each of these occasions the appellant is proved to have obtained cash payouts in round dollar numbers. The payouts were not consistent with poker machine winnings or jackpots having been obtained. They are consistent with someone having deposited money in a machine and then immediately seeking to retrieve it using the conventional processes of the club. It is important that on no occasion when the credit card was used was the appellant at his work.  
     
      
       
      Other killers 
       
      
    81 I am also satisfied that the jury were entitled to exclude Mr Naidu from consideration as the possible killer. Although he was a person of Malaysian Indian extraction the evidence of his family members was that he did not wear a moustache. It is true that Mr Davies, who had worked with Mr Naidu gave evidence that, on occasions, he had seen Mr Naidu wearing a moustache but it would seem that his recollection may be unreliable. 
     
      
    82 In any event, to my mind the photographic evidence is compelling. The photographs taken at the ATM on the morning of 23 August 1997 bear a striking resemblance to the surveillance photographs taken of the appellant. The person accessing the ATM is of Indian features, has a moustache, wears glasses and is smoking. 
     
      
    83 Photographs of Mr Naidu do not ever reveal a moustache and photographs taken both before and after the murder show that his hairline has receded significantly further than the hairline of the person accessing the ATM. 
     
      
    84 The trial judge was careful to warn the jury of the difficulties when considering evidence of identification, particularly evidence across cultures. No complaint is made by the appellant about these directions. The conclusion which the jury reached indicates that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who was accessing the ATMs. To my mind the evidence for this finding was strong. 
     
      
    85 I am also satisfied that the jury were entitled to exclude Chaman Lal Khanna as the possible killer. There was no reason to doubt his evidence that his relationship with the deceased was brief and had ended many years ago. Although a letter implicating him as the killer was written this could quite appropriately be viewed as an attempt by the true killer to divert the attention of the investigators. 
     
      
       
      The pawning of the camera 
       
      
    86 The appellant submitted that although the appellant had possession of the deceased’s camera the fact that he disclosed his name and other details when “pawning” it was inconsistent with him being the killer. There was evidence that the appellant was not an unintelligent person and accordingly it was submitted that it was inconceivable that, if he was guilty of the offence, he would have taken this course. It was submitted that there was no evidence of ransacking of the deceased’s premises where other items of value, particularly jewellery were found. 
     
      
    87 The difficulty with this submission is that there is no evidence that the appellant was aware that it would be possible to trace the camera back to the deceased. Accordingly, in providing his personal details the appellant ensured that his actions would not create suspicion in the minds of the pawnbroker. An intelligent person may be concerned about the possibility of creating that suspicion but not be aware that police tracking mechanisms would enable the camera to be traced to the deceased. 
     
      
       
      Other matters 
       
      
    88 It is true that there are some unexplained matters in the Crown case. The person who the deceased spoke to in the evening of 22 August 1997 whilst at work is unknown. It could have been the appellant or it could have been some other person. The reason for her agitation following the phone call on that evening is also not known. The letter received by the police on 21 November 1997 is also unexplained. It was not possible, using the sample of the appellant’s handwriting available to the police, to establish whether it was written in the appellant’s hand or exclude him as the author. It also contains details personal to the deceased which someone who was reasonably familiar with her circumstances would have known.  
     
      
    89 There was also no evidence as to how the person who used the credit card obtained the deceased’s PIN. The evidence was that the deceased was a secretive person who would have been unlikely to give her PIN to another person. There was no evidence of ransacking the deceased’s unit. 
     
      
    90 There was no evidence of the appellant having a particular need for money. Both he and his wife were in gainful employment and although they had a loan for the purchase of a motor car they had few debts and apparently were able to meet their outgoings. Furthermore, the listening device material provided no inculpatory evidence and included statements by the appellant in which he questioned why the police were interested in him as the possible killer. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    91 Notwithstanding that these matters have been left unexplained, having reviewed the whole of the evidence I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to convict the appellant of murder. There are a number of matters of critical significance to this conclusion. I have previously referred to them. 
     
      
    92 Finally, the coincidence that the appellant had possession of the deceased’s camera points significantly to him being the killer. The jury were entitled to reject his explanation as fanciful. To my mind the jury were entitled to find that the deceased was murdered. The suggestion that someone came into the deceased’s unit after she had passed away and stole her credit card cannot be reconciled with the lack of any evidence of forced entry to her unit. 
     
      
    93 An examination of the photographic material demonstrates a striking resemblance between surveillance photographs of the appellant taken close to the relevant date and the photographic material from the ATMs. This evidence has to be considered in light of the fact that there is evidence of the appellant being present and obtaining cash payouts from clubs where, at a time proximate to the appellant obtaining the payouts, ATMs are accessed using the deceased’s credit card. The coincidence of these events on more than one occasion and the fact that the appellant was retrieving cash which he had already placed in poker machines is powerful evidence of his guilt.  
     
      
    94 This evidence must be considered together with the fact that the appellant knew the deceased and that his wife had established a friendship with her. Although Mr Naidu and the deceased’s former husband also knew her, having regard to the photographic evidence and other details, particularly of Mr Naidu’s appearance, from other witnesses the jury were entitled to discard them as the potential killer. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    95 The appellant cannot suggest that he was mentally ill at the time of the murder. However, the evidence disclosed that he suffered depression in the years 2003-2004 when he was seen by the mental health team at Liverpool. He has also been diagnosed with diabetes. 
     
      
    96 Although the appellant was not charged with murder until 2007 he was charged in 1999 with various counts of obtaining money by deception relating to the use of the deceased’s credit card and two counts of stealing relating to the deceased’s camera and lens and one count of receiving in relation to his possession of the same items. A coronial inquest into the death of the deceased was conducted in 2003 and the Coroner was satisfied that there was evidence capable of sustaining a charge of murder against the appellant. It was only on 19 August 2004 that the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that an ex officio indictment be filed against the appellant. 
     
      
    97 The appellant’s wife gave evidence that her husband was mentally affected by the fraud charges and the prospect of a murder charge which was hanging over his head from 1999 until 2004. It was at her request that the appellant was seen by the Liverpool Mental Health Unit. 
     
      
    98 At the hearing on sentence the appellant’s solicitor submitted that by reason of the appellant’s depression his time in gaol would be more difficult than for a person not similarly afflicted. However, the sentencing judge considered those issues. In his remarks on sentence the trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept the evidence of Dr Krishnan concerning your diabetes status and the diagnosis of depression advanced by Dr Diment. Your poor health will make the incidents of imprisonment more onerous than would be the case if you were in a more robust condition. It is also relevant, particularly in terms of supervision and treatment, to consider this matter when setting a proportion between non parole period and total sentence.” 
        
       
      
    99 The appellant emphasised the substantial delay between the murder which occurred in 1997 and the filing of the ex officio indictment on 19 August 2004 and his ultimate trial which took place in 2007. The lengthy history of the matter was the subject of submissions before the trial judge. It is explained by the difficulty the police had in obtaining evidence relevant to the offence. Although in 1999 the appellant was charged with the counts relating to the use of the credit card and the camera and lens, it was not until 2003 that a coronial inquest assembled the evidence relevant to the alleged murder. Even then further police inquiries were necessary. The DPP finally filed the ex officio indictment in August 2004. The delay between the filing of the indictment and the appellant’s ultimate trial are explained by problems beyond the control of the prosecution together with a successful application in September 2005 by the defence to vacate the trial date. A trial commenced in October 2006 but was aborted and the matter was relisted for trial in February 2007. 
     
      
    100 When sentencing the trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The second matter is an appreciation of the effects of delay in your being brought to trial. Although, as I have said, you were a suspect within weeks of the killing in August 1997, the trial did not take place until 2007. No challenge was offered to the chronology advanced by your counsel nor the evidence of your wife that although she was interviewed in November 1997, you were not interviewed until December 1999. Of course, in the interim there was obviously a significant amount of painstaking detective work undertaken as revealed by the tracing of the use of the card on the ATMs, your presence when it was being used on occasions and the disposal by you of a camera which had been owned by the deceased. As I have mentioned, however, in December 1999 you were charged only with fraud offences. 
        
       
       
        
        From December 1999 to December 2003 you were required to attend court on between twenty and thirty occasions. The adjournments were sought by the prosecution and eventually the court (presumably the Local Court) was informed that no charge of murder would be preferred by the Director of Public Prosecutions. However, the fraud charges were not proceeded with pending the holding of an inquest into the death of Ms Khanna. This took place in December 2003 and subsequently in about August 2004 an ex officio indictment for murder was presented against you. 
        
       
       
        
        You were on bail until I committed you to custody on 5 March 2007 following the jury verdict. Nevertheless this long delay was not of your making and it is appropriate to take into account the situation of uncertain suspense in which you must have been for an uncommonly lengthy period.” 
        
       
      
    101 In these remarks his Honour appropriately recognised the part which delay in bringing the matter to trial should play in determining the appellant’s sentence. From the time of the offence until he came to trial the appellant would have been unsure as to his fate. This was, as his Honour commented, a very lengthy period. However, the appellant pleaded not guilty and it could not be suggested that during this period he had progressed towards rehabilitation which may be relevant in appropriate cases (see R v Abookahled, NSWCCA, 9 May 1991, unreported). 
     
      
    102 The appellant complains that his sentence was manifestly excessive. When sentencing his Honour had regard to the available statistical material applying to similar offences committed between 1994 and 2001. The median sentence for offences was a head sentence of 18 years and a non-parole period of 13.25 years. The range of head sentences extended between 10 years and life. His Honour accepted the statistics as a guide.  
     
      
    103 When sentencing his Honour found that the offence “manifested a callous indifference to what you did and to what you had done.” In my opinion his Honour was more than entitled to make this finding. It justified a sentence at the higher end of the available range. A sentence comprising a non-parole period of 14 years with an overall term of 20 years was, in my view well within the appropriate range. It was not manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Orders: 
       
      
    104 In my opinion the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. Although I would grant leave to appeal against sentence I would dismiss that appeal.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Arthur Maybury is now forty-one years of age. It is a matter of considerable sadness that in his evidence today he said that four of the years he had before he was ten years old were the happiest time in his life. Since then, he has never known happiness that he knew when he was cared for by foster parents who support him to this day. 2 Mr Maybury was abandoned by both of his parents at only three years of age and placed in a boys’ home. From there, he went to live with his foster parents and spent the happy time that I have referred to. However, his mother came back on the scene and she was given custody of Mr Maybury again. 3 The time that he spent with her was terrible. He was subject to repeated acts of violence from her. She was an alcoholic and so was his stepfather. His natural father was also an alcoholic. In those circumstances, it is not surprising to find that Mr Maybury also has had a long and difficult problem with alcohol leading up to the commission of a number of serious offences. 4 It is alcohol that leads Mr Maybury astray. It causes him to become violent and, to put the matters more precisely, it causes him to commit violent crimes. I have to deal with Mr Maybury today for a number of offences of violence committed whilst he was significantly intoxicated, but he well knew that he had a history of aggression and violence when drunk, so the fact that he was drunk when he committed these offences is not a mitigating feature at all in this case. 5 The matters that I have to deal with today come before me in a number of ways. Let me, firstly, deal with two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed by the offender on a man by the name of Stanley Graber. There are some similarities between the way these offences came about, and the way two other offences that I have to deal with later on in these remarks came about. 6 The offender took it upon himself to act violently towards an acquaintance of his. He was followed into his flat by the offender and punched to his face three times. That led to the offender being charged with an offence of common assault. After those acts of violence, Mr Maybury left the unit and went to another home unit. The victim s followed him, believing that Mr Maybury had left the vicinity, but when the two saw each other again, Mr Maybury got up from the lounge and again punched the victim to his face. He punched him about eight or nine times on this occasion causing his nose to bleed. 7 When the offender was interviewed, he said that he was incensed by the victim sexually propositioning him two weeks earlier. It is difficult to accept that that is the case when what the offender said to the victim while he was punching him on the initial occasion was “Stop telling Ecky’s mother rumours about me.” In truth, what has probably led to these two acts of violence is simply the offender’s excessive alcohol consumption.8 For those matters, he was placed on s 9 bonds by a magistrate. One of the conditions of the bonds was that he accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service but he failed to do so and so he was called up. The magistrate then put him on s 12 bonds suspending the execution of the sentence. The magistrate imposed a sentence of imprisonment for three months but suspended their execution for that time, however, the offender committed other offences which I will shortly deal with, representing a breach of those s 12 bonds and so he is to be dealt with for that breach. He has consented to me dealing with those breaches today so that he can have matters over and done with and look forward to the future with some certainty.9 As well as those matters, the offender has pleaded guilty to very serious offences, one of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and one of threatening to damage or destroy property with intent to injure someone else. Those offences came about in the following way.10 The offender lived in a shed at the rear of premises owned by a woman by the name of Elaine Stoddart. A man by the name of Tony Williams, who became the victim of the other two offences that I will shortly describe, lived as a border in the house. In the weeks leading up to these offences, the offender had become increasingly aggressive towards the occupants of the house, so much so that Miss Stoddart took the decision that she would ask the offender to leave. She, therefore, went with Mr Williams to Cessnock Police Station to seek police assistance to evict the offender. Thus, he was asked to leave the premises on 10 February. He pleaded to be able to remain at the house and so it was decided that he would stay one more night before leaving. The police then left but all that led to was the offender taking advantage of the opportunity, that thus presented itself, to become violent towards Mr Williams.11 The offender began by shoving Mr Williams in his chest and told him to go to the shed where he lived. Once there, he was told to sit on the couch and Mr Maybury punched the victim to his face with both fists. He said to him, 
     
      
       
      “You’re a dog and I’ll get you back before I go. I’ll burn the shed, I’ll burn the house. Don’t doubt me, arsehole”.  
      
    12 He continued to punch Mr Williams to his face until Mr Williams began bleeding. This did not cause the offender in any way to cease what he was doing. Indeed, things got worse. He picked up a knife and pressed the point of it to Mr Williams’ throat. They struggled for a while before Mr Williams released his hold and the offender threw the knife away.13 At one stage the offender used a towel to wipe the blood away from Mr William’s face but he then hit Mr Williams in the face with the towel and punched him again before kneeing him to the ribs. He poked him in the face with a broken piece of dowel. 14 These attacks led to Mr Williams suffering a number of serious injuries. He suffered a broken nose, a broken cheekbone and a broken eye socket. He suffered significant bruising, abrasions and swelling to his face. He suffered bruising to his ribs. That, however, was not enough for the offender. He wanted more. And so he demanded that Mr Williams lie down on the bed. He had earlier asked him to remove his T-shirt. At this stage, the offender poured petrol over Mr William’s body and, in particular, the shorts that he was wearing. The offender then sat on a chair next to the bed where the victim lay and lit a cigarette lighter. He threatened to light Mr Williams with the lighter. Indeed, he picked up a shirt and held the lighter to it and then to the mosquito netting above the bed. Scorch marks were later found on the shirt.15 The victim begged the offender to stop. Fortunately, the offender’s mobile phone rang and after he answered the telephone call, his demeanour changed. Indeed, he apologised to Mr Williams and left the premises. 16 Not surprisingly, Mr Williams has been left with consequences which extend beyond mere physical injury. Those consequences were entirely understandable and foreseeable. They are set out in a Victim Impact Statement tendered to me. Mr Williams has been significantly harmed by the offender’s disgraceful conduct and that is a matter I will give considerable weight to in determining the appropriate way in which I will deal with Mr Maybury.17 I mentioned something of Mr Maybury’s earlier background. After living with his mother for awhile and going to school, he ended up leaving school at year 8 but has worked regularly since then, most recently in the construction industry as a labourer. He has lost a few jobs in the past due to his alcohol consumption and the unreliability that that causes. 18 His alcoholism has, of course, interfered to a significant extent with his interpersonal relationships. He has a daughter but his former partner will not let his daughter have any access to Mr Maybury because of his abuse of alcohol.19 On top of all this, a few months before the offences involving Mr Williams, the offender started to use ICE. He has no memory of the offences involving Mr Williams but, as I said earlier, it is not a mitigating feature in this case that these offences were committed by the offender whilst intoxicated because he knew full well that if he became intoxicated to excess, he was likely to become violent and aggressive.20 I mentioned one unusual aspect of Mr Maybury’s life earlier in these remarks on sentence but there is another striking one and that is that Mr Maybury says, and anyone who heard this case would agree, that Mr Maybury going to gaol is the best thing that could have ever happened to him. He has made a significant transition from a violent alcoholic to a person who is actually regarded by the authorities as a role model whilst in prison. It is a remarkable journey and one which can be put down to the fact that Mr Maybury no longer has easy access to alcohol and is, therefore, perhaps for the first time in a very long time, able to look at the person he is and rationally think about what he wants to become.21 The offender has plans for the future which recognise the scourge that alcohol is for him. He wishes to continue the rehabilitative efforts that he has begun whilst in custody. He sees a future for himself. He wants to re-establish contact with his daughter. He wants to recommence work and he wants to become a person who is not violent. 22 Thinking straight has enabled him also to recognise the harm that he has caused, in particular to Mr Williams. He was able to express his remorse to Mr Williams who was present in court. It has to be said that there is no evidence that Mr Williams has, in any way, forgiven Mr Maybury for what happened to him, nor should he. Mr Williams has suffered what was clearly gratuitous cruelty, at the hands of the offender. It is probably not going too far to say that by throwing petrol on him and lighting the lighter, Mr Maybury was torturing Mr Williams. That this occurred after he had already broken many bones in Mr Williams’ face just shows how serious his conduct was.23 Of course, it is also an aggravating feature that these offences were committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty, those two s 12 bonds that I have earlier referred to, and it is significant that they too were for offences of violence. 24 I am satisfied that the remorse that Mr Maybury has expressed is genuine and that he is ashamed of the sort of person that he was when drunk. I am satisfied that he has a genuine desire to overcome his alcohol problem. He has already done much but there is a long way to go. Should he be successful he is unlikely to re-offend.25 I note also that the offender pleaded guilty at an early opportunity. That is evidence not only of his remorse but also has a utilitarian value which should be reflected in a discount in the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twenty-five per cent. 26 There are special circumstances in this case. One of the most important perhaps is that it is my recommendation that the offender be released to parole only after he is accepted into a long term alcohol rehabilitation program similar to the Salvation Army Lake Macquarie Recovery Services Centre Program which runs for ten months. That is a residential program and has been regarded as quasi custody in the past. It is my expectation that upon the expiry of Mr Maybury’s non-parole period, he will be required to attend such a program, and so the relationship between non-parole period and head sentence is significantly varied in view of the quasi custody which I expect will occur after the expiry of the non-parole period.27 Mr Maybury has had an appalling upbringing. He is person who is deserving of considerable sympathy. He is clearly very upset at where he finds himself today. He clearly longs for those four years that he spent with his foster parents. It is a credit to them that they still support him. But despite all the sympathy that I feel towards Mr Maybury, I must recognise that he has committed serious criminal offences. Although I am satisfied of Mr Maybury’s genuine desire to rehabilitate himself, it must be recognised that things are not going to be easy for him once he is returned to the community. For that reason, I consider that there needs to be a substantial component of personal deterrence in the sentences I will shortly announce. There needs, also, to be a substantial component of general deterrence. There are many violent alcoholics around who should know that violence caused by excessive alcohol consumption is not an excuse and that where it occurs, it will be dealt with severely. 28 I revoke the order for suspension in relation to the concurrent three month terms of imprisonment imposed by the magistrate. The offender will thus be subject to concurrent three month fixed terms from the 11 February 2007 to 10 May 2007. I will impose concurrent sentences for the matters to which he pleaded guilty at the local court and which were committed for sentence to this Court.29 On each case, I set a non-parole period of fifteen months to have commenced on 11 May 2007 and to expire on 10 August 2008 on which day the offender will be eligible to be released to parole. I set a head sentence of three and a half years. The effective non-parole period is eighteen months and it is my firm recommendation that the offender’s release on parole be conditional upon him attending and remaining at the Salvation Army Lake Macquarie Recovery Services Centre Program or a similar program until satisfactory completion of that program.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Police went to Raymond Cadd’s premises on 27 February 2007. They obviously had information that he was a drug dealer. That information turned out to be correct. When they got to his home they entered the premises and discovered three brown paper bags. Each of those paper bags contained within it a clear resealable bag with cannabis inside.2 Mr Cadd was thus arrested and taken to Singleton Police Station. The police continued searching his premises with his daughter, twenty-six years of age, observing the search. It is worth noting that also present during the search was the offender’s grand-daughter, who is four years of age. I wonder, in passing, what sort of example the offender is setting to his daughter and grand-daughter.3 Police then continued searching and they discovered more cannabis. This was in a jar on the kitchen bench. They found also some clear plastic bags containing methylamphetamine. They found some scales and a large amount of cash, indeed $5000 bundled in $1000 lots.4 When they had finished searching they interviewed the offender. Eventually, during that interview, he admitted that the drugs were his and admitted that he was supplying them. The total amount of drugs found by police was 248.7 grams of cannabis and 9.4 grams of methylamphetamine.5 This is not the first time the offender will serve a sentence of imprisonment for drug supplying. Indeed, it is the third.6 He was dealt with in Tamworth Local Court in 2001 for supplying a prohibited drug, three counts in fact, and was sent to gaol for three months. Then, in Tamworth District Court, in 2002 he was again dealt with for supplying a prohibited drug and sent to gaol for three years with a non-parole period of two years. 7 There comes a time when it is clear that personal deterrence just ceases to operate. It is clear that personal deterrence is not going to work. There is nothing significant that has changed between the offender’s situation in 2002 and now. He has, he tells me, re-established contact with a son and his daughter, Kylie. He has had another grandchild too, but these are not the sort of things which are likely to make a substantial difference to someone like Mr Cadd who, he says through stupidity, continues to commit drug supply offences despite having gone to gaol for drug supply in the past.8 When personal deterrence does not work, all the courts can really do is to keep offenders in a position where they are unable to commit crimes, that is preventative detention. Of course, that is not to say that the sentence can be increased from what would otherwise be appropriate but it is to recognise that one of the purposes of sentencing, namely personal deterrence, is probably not going to have much impact on the sentence I will shortly announce.9 The offender says that he did this to supplement his income. He was gambling at the time, he wanted to take one of his sons down to visit his mother, (that is his son’s mother who was in custody) and he wanted to supplement his Disability Pension. 10 Nothing that I have heard today would suggest that the offender will, when he wants to supplement his income again, be in a position to say to himself, “I’m not going to do it through drug supply.” There is easy money to be made through drug supply and the fact that there was $5000 cash found in the offender’s premises is testament to that.11 He said to police that he was doing what he was doing to make ends meet. No doubt he will come under financial difficulties in the future and I have got no confidence at all that the offender will have learnt any lesson at all upon his release from custody.12 As Mr Booth said, as far as the offender is concerned, he has not had a lot of luck in his life and he has suffered a few knocks. These are all detailed in a psychological report which was tendered by Mr Booth on behalf of the offender.13 The offender had an unhappy childhood with his parents’ relationship being inherently unstable. His mother finally left the home, leaving the offender in the care of his father. But his father was a heavy drinker and was always at the pub. He began associating with peers who indulged in anti-social activity and that too became his lifestyle.14 He has worked in the past and had a number of jobs before his working life was interrupted in a significant way when he was involved in a motor vehicle collision. This was in 1982 and the consequences for Mr Cadd extend to this day. He underwent a spinal fusion operation in 1986 and since then has been unable to work for any length of time. He did drive the Sackville ferry for about eighteen months but had to give it up as it was too much for him. 15 He is now on a great variety of medication, all designed to deal with his constant pain. If he was free in the community he would be more appropriately medicated but drugs which would be available to him if he were a free man are not available to him in prison because of the risks that the supply of those drugs present to the prison community. Thus, to say succinctly what the problem is, he will do his time in custody harder because of his inability to obtain optimum medication.16 However, not too much should be made of this. After all, the offender went into this with is eyes open. He must have known full well the consequences of serving a sentence of imprisonment in so far as they affect his ability to get analgesic medication.17 It is always a bit rich for an offender to rely on circumstances such as this when offenders such as Mr Cadd understand the consequences for them of their offending behaviour in the event that they are caught. Nevertheless, I will make an allowance for the fact that Mr Cadd will do his time in custody harder than would otherwise be the case.18 That is also going to be the case because of Mr Cadd’s mental condition. He suffers from depression and, unlike many people, that depression is not just simply related to his present predicament.19 The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, although he was re-arraigned today because of some defect in the committal document. I will discount the sentence I would otherwise impose by 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas.20 As I mentioned, the offender does have prior convictions for supplying a prohibited drug. In case I have not made myself clear, I will regard this as a case where the offender has displayed a continuing attitude of disobedience towards the law, particularly in relation to drug supply matters and formulate the appropriate sentence in the light of that attitude.21 As Mr Booth quite fairly recognises, there is one significant matter which makes the offender’s conduct even more serious than is often the case and that is that the offender was not a drug user himself. This is not a case where the offender was a drug addict, merely fulfilling his addiction by taking drugs for himself or herself off a larger amount that he or she supplied. This is a case where the offender went into this activity for a very cynical reason and that is solely to make money. True it is that he was not spending that money on luxury items and the trappings of wealth were not in any way apparent, but he was able to do things with the money that he would not otherwise have been able to do. The courts have traditionally regarded non-user dealers such as Mr Cadd as the most serious type of offender. 22 In so far as some of the money was spent on gambling, that hardly explains, let alone justifies, a decision to become once again a drug dealer, a decision to supply others with harmful drugs simply so that the offender could put a few dollars through the poker machines from time to time and thus forget about his unhappiness. In any case, it does not appear that this is the sort of gambling addiction which is often before the courts. The fact that the offender had $5000 in cash in his premises when the police searched them suggests that the offender was, if addicted, certainly able to control his addiction.23 The offender is clearly sorry for the consequences which must flow from his offences. He became quite tearful in the witness box when he spoke about him losing his contact with some of his children. I am, of course, satisfied that he is sorry for the consequences for him but not at all persuaded that the offender is remorseful in the sense that it is a mitigating featurem.24 Mr Booth says I should find special circumstances in this case. There are two reasons I am not going to. The first is that I can see no utility at all in the offender having an extended period of supervision on parole but the second and more important reason is that the sentence I am about to announce has a non-parole period which is as low as it can properly be. Any lower non-parole period would fail to reflect the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct.25 I will make the sentences wholly concurrent, despite the fact that there were two different sorts of drugs involved. I will impose concurrent sentences as a measure of leniency towards Mr Cadd.26 The sentences are, therefore, as follows:On each count, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of three years to date from 27 February 2007 and a head sentence of four years. The non-parole period will thus expire on 26 February 2010 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

      SENTENCE 
       
      1. I am sentencing Virginia Jabreal. She has been charged with three offences under s29B of the  
      Crimes Act 1914 
       of the Commonwealth. In addition, she has been charged with three offences under s135.1(5) of the  
      Criminal Code 1995 
       of the Commonwealth. Each of the s29B offences carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, and the s135.1 offences carry a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. 
       
       
      2. The s29B offences are offences shortly known as imposition on the Commonwealth. The offence comprises imposing upon a Commonwealth authority by an untrue representation with a view to obtaining a benefit. These cases usually concern benefits from the Social Security system, and this case is no exception. 
       
       
      3. The offences under s135.1 are shortly known as dishonesty causing a loss to another person knowing that the loss would occur. Section 135 of the  
      Criminal Code 
       effectively replaced s29B of the  
      Crimes Act 
      .  
       
       
      4. Briefly this is what Mrs Jabreal’s criminal behaviour was. She was paid various sorts of social security payments by the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency, formerly known as the Department of Social Security. At the time of receiving various kinds of benefits, she was also employed by the St Johns Park Bowling Club. There is an obligation understandably to declare paid employment to the Commonwealth agency responsible for paying a pension or a benefit. Briefly, Mrs Jabreal failed to declare her income from her employment. Had she declared her income from her employment, which was an annual salary of over $30,000.00, that would have reduced or eliminated the payments which she was receiving from the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency.  
       
       
      5. She undertook this deception over a period of some seven years. Her offending behaviour has been made the subject, as I said, of the six charges. The three charges under s29B refer to three periods. The first charge refers to the period 9 July 1998 to 14 September 1999. The second charge refers to the period 14 March 2000 to 9 May 2000. The third s29B charge refers to the period 6 June 2000 until 22 May 2001.  
       
       
      6. The first s135.1 charge refers to the period 5 June 2001 to about 26 April 2002. The second s135.1 charge refers to the period 10 May 2002 until 26 March 2004. The third s135.1 charge refers to the period 9 April 2004 to 28 January 2005.  
       
       
      7. Over that period of time Mrs Jabreal filled in various forms which posed questions such as, “Did you do any work over the relevant period?”, and she answered, “No”. At other times she received letters of advice concerning the means of calculating her entitlement. The advice letters also informed her of her obligation to notify the authorities of her employment. 
       
       
      8. The way that this behaviour of Mrs Jabreal came to light is a significant feature of this case. On 9 February 2005, that is a week or so after the closing date of the last offence, she contacted the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency by telephone. She admitted that she had been working since 2000, and that her average earnings were $450 to $500 a week. In fact, she had been working for longer than that, but she also provided them with full details of her employment and employer. 
       
       
      9. As a result of her failure to disclose her employment, as I said, she was paid at a higher rate than she ought to have been paid, or paid benefits which she ought not to have been paid at all. The overpayment has been calculated as $60,097.35. The overpayment, which is the subject of the s29B charges, is just over $19,000, and the overpayment, which is the subject of the s135.1 charges, is nearly $41,000. 
       
       
      10. Mr Nematalla, who appears for Mrs Jabreal, tendered some documents and called his client to give evidence. She gave an account of coming to Australia from Iraq in 1994. She left for various reasons, including political oppression. She arrived with her four sons and her husband followed her. However, after her husband arrived he did not undertake any paid employment. It was Mrs Jabreal who was the breadwinner in the family. Not only that but he was a gambler. He used to gamble away a good deal of the money which ought to have been expended on household items. As Mrs Jabreal said, she earned the money, he took the money, and he stayed at home. 
       
       
      11. As it happened, her husband died in September 1999. That, however, did not ease her financial pressures. She still had her four sons at home and they were, at that stage, all or mostly at school. She had to borrow something like $5000 for her husband’s funeral. She had already borrowed money from her sister in order to come to Australia.  
       
       
      12. When she was asked about her behaviour, she described it as a mistake which is, to my mind, a somewhat mild description of her criminal behaviour. However, she also told me that she had, as I indicated, provided the authorities with all the details regarding her employer. On that issue, it has been submitted by Ms McKenzie, who appears for the prosecutor, that the disclosure by Mrs Jabreal has been somewhat qualified. I can see the force in that submission but, on balance, I do not accept it. I do not accept it for this reason. Although Mrs Jabreal’s disclosure was partial, and not complete, she provided the authorities with all the information that they would need in order to ascertain how much she had been paid by her employer over the relevant period, and how much, therefore, she had been overpaid by the Agency. 
       
       
      13. As Mrs Jabreal said, when her sons had grown older, she then contacted the agency. She said that most of the additional money was spent on routine day-to-day housekeeping expenses. She was asked whether there was any greed involved, and she denied that. As Hunt J said, speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal, in  
      Regina v Purdon 
       NSWCCA, unreported, 27 March 1997, the principles of sentencing for these kinds of offences are “ 
      not based upon the fact many of the frauds are perpetrated from motives of greed rather than need. Both types of fraud are widespread. They are equally difficult to detect. If the fraud is based upon a perceived need, a custodial sentence must be expected, except in very special circumstances. If the fraud is based on greed, the custodial sentence will be longer 
      ”. I regard the circumstances of the offending, in this case, as fundamentally stemming from need rather than greed. Mrs Jabreal was in debt as a result of a couple of significant loans. She was trying to manage her household at the time that her husband was alive, when he was both not earning and spending a good deal of the money which she was earning on gambling.  
       
       
      14. I am aware of the fact - or I have not overlooked the fact - that it is only one of the offences, namely the first s29B offence, which was committed before her late husband died. The other five offences have been committed since then. Nevertheless, given the evidence about the loan, which she had to undertake for his funeral, and the fact that she was raising four children on a relatively modest income, I find that her criminal behaviour was driven by need rather than greed. I emphasise this makes no difference to the principle espoused by the Court of Criminal Appeal that these cases should be dealt with by a custodial sentence. But as Hunt J said, it is relevant to the length of that sentence. 
       
       
      15. Her sons are still at home. They are now aged twenty-five, twenty-three, twenty-two and twenty-one. A couple of them are working, and a couple of them are not working at present but expect to get some work relatively soon.  
       
       
      16. Mrs Jabreal gave evidence that she was prepared to pay back the amount which she owes to the agency. She has already paid back some $3000. She has a superannuation fund with about $32,000 in it. She is attempting to make arrangements to release those funds so that they can be paid. In those circumstances, she will have to rely upon her sons to support her instead of relying upon that fund in the future. She invites me to make an order for reparation.  
       
       
      17. In cross-examination she said that she had been working at the Bowling Club since 1997. She received in December last year a staff recognition certificate for ten years’ continuous service at the Club. Her income, she said, was barely enough to pay the rent, and when asked in cross-examination about what motivated her to effectively steal the money from the Commonwealth, she said words to the effect of, “When I needed it I took it, and I will pay it back when I can”. In re-examination she pointed out that when her husband was alive they were not able to save any funds because it all went into poker machines.  
       
       
      18. There is evidence in the form of a report from her General Practitioner who points out that she has some osteo-arthritis in her hands and associated pain in her neck and shoulder. The senior duty manager of her employer asserts that he has found her to be an honest and reliable member of staff. My understanding is that the author of that reference does not know about the current charges. 
       
       
      19. Mrs Jabreal was interviewed and assessed by officers of the Probation and Parole Service. They produced two reports, both this year, one quite recent. It confirms the history, which she gave, concerning her arrival in Australia and her marriage to her husband and her husband’s gambling habit. 
       
       
      20. The officer preparing the first report indicated that in the interview Mrs Jabreal tendered to place culpability for her offending behaviour on her husband’s gambling and lack of employment, and then she needed to continue claiming financial benefits to support her family. The officer noted that she tended to minimise her actions. He concluded that Mrs Jabreal’s insight into her offending behaviour is limited. He thought she was unlikely to benefit from or require supervision. She was unsuitable for a community service order but suitable for periodic detention. Those assessments were confirmed in the report prepared on 17 October 2007. 
       
       
      21. In the second report, the officer spoke to Mrs Jabreal’s sister who told him that Mrs Jabreal was constantly borrowing money from family to buy household necessities and to pay for school fees. This confirms my conclusion that the offending behaviour was driven by need rather than greed. The more recent report also confirmed her suitability for periodic detention but not for a community service order. 
       
       
      22. I have had the benefit of submissions by both legal representatives. I make the following observations and findings, where relevant, concerning the objective seriousness of the offending behaviour.  
       
       
      23. The overall amount involved was not insignificant. It was not a figure in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions, which some of these crimes might involve, but nor was it an amount of only $5000 or $10,000. It was, as I said, not insignificant. 
       
       
      24. The maximum penalty for the s29B offences is two years and the maximum penalty for the s315 offences is five years. Parliament obviously regarded it as important to mark the seriousness of these kinds of offences by taking the opportunity to significantly increase the penalty for the offences.  
       
       
      25. I find, as I have said, that the behaviour was motivated by need rather than greed. I note that the authorities, and once again I refer to Hunt Js judgment in  
      Purdon 
      , 
        
      “ 
      make it clear beyond any doubt that, in the case of a fraud upon the Social Security system, a custodial sentence is to be imposed unless their exists very special circumstances justifying some lesser order 
      .” As his Honour said, the rationale for that rule “ 
      is that the offence is easy to commit but difficult to detect. It is widespread, and the introduction of more checks upon applicants for social security would cause delays in the payment of benefits and, therefore, hardship to those whose need is urgent. 
      ” As his Honour said, an additional burden is placed upon all taxpayers who shoulder the heavy burden of providing the funds for the Social Security system to operate. The burden becomes even heavier because of widespread abuse to it by frauds. 
       
       
      26. One is tempted to regard Mrs Jabreal’s behaviour as understandable. She came from difficult personal circumstances in Iraq, she was supporting four children, her husband was contributing nothing to the household and, indeed, was draining the household of essential funds. But, on the other hand, it is important to appreciate that thousands of men and women in Australia who have jobs do not elect to behave as Mrs Jabreal did. They do not claim and receive Social Security benefits to which they are not entitled because they are already employed, and I add that sometimes it is a matter of being paid at a higher or lower rate. People like Mrs Jabreal who commit these sorts of frauds on the Commonwealth social security system bring about, as Hunt J said, the need for more checks upon applicants, which cause delays in the payment to applicants and, therefore, hardship upon those whose need is urgent. She has, on one view of things, stolen by deception $60,000 from the Commonwealth government. I appreciate that the offence is not one of theft, and I am using that expressing by way of a comparison or analogy. 
       
       
      27. On the subjective side, Mrs Jabreal’s voluntary cessation of her criminal behaviour and disclosure to the Department is, as I have said, significant. Mr Nematalla has drawn my attention to the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in  
      Regina v Burns 
       [2007] NSWCCA 228. The judgment of the court comprising the Chief Justice, and Simpson and Harrison JJ was delivered by Harrison J. His Honour referred to the principles relevant to the voluntary cessation of criminal activity. As his Honour said at [27], it is “ 
      well recognised as a significant factor to take it into account by a sentencing tribunal. 
      ” His Honour said at [29] that there were a number of reasons why it was a significant factor. His Honour listed four reasons which I will refer to and comment on so far as this case is concerned. 
       
       
      28. The first reason is that there is a public policy to be served in providing encouragement to offenders to cease their criminal activities. I regard this as relevant and applicable to this case. Mrs Jabreal has seen the error of her ways and voluntarily stopped her criminal behaviour. Not only that, she has disclosed that criminal behaviour to the authorities. That kind of activity is to be encouraged as a matter of public policy and I will take it into account, in her favour, in sentencing her. 
       
       
      29. The second factor mentioned by Harrison J is that specific deterrence is a matter to be given little or no weight. I will come back to comment on that shortly.  
       
      30. The third factor is that the voluntary cessation of criminal activity provides strong evidence of remorse, contrition and rehabilitation.  
       
       
      31. I comment on both those factors together so far as this case is concerned. I am not completely convinced about Mrs Jabreal’s remorse. I do regard her as somewhat remorseful. She has taken the steps to cease her criminal activity, but the impression that I get from her evidence is that she undertook the exercise over the period of time that she did because she simply needed the money. I get the impression that she made a fairly detached and calculated decision to apply for and obtain the money and that she would cease obtaining the money when she thought it was no longer needed. That is supported by her evidence that when her sons were older and had grown up she contacted the authorities. As she said in evidence in cross-examination, when she needed it she took it and she paid it back when she could. 
       
       
      32. Hence I do not regard the voluntary cessation of criminal activity, in this case, as providing strong evidence of remorse or contrition. I regard it as providing some evidence but I am not convinced, on the balance of probabilities, that her remorse is strong. I am convinced that she has some remorse. Hence also, so far as specific deterrence is concerned, I regard there still to be a place in this sentencing exercise for Mrs Jabreal to be reminded of the seriousness of what she has undertaken. My impression is that she may not have understood the seriousness of the criminal behaviour she was entering upon in embarking on the course which she did. 
       
       
      33. The final factor mentioned by Harrison J was that the voluntary cessation of criminal activity may support the proposition that the offence was committed as a result of need rather than greed. It does support that proposition in this case. As I have said, Mrs Jabreal not only ceased her criminal activity but voluntarily disclosed it, and in effect in a fulsome way, such that she provided the authorities with enough information for them to ascertain the full extent of her criminal behaviour.  
       
       
      34. Mrs Jabreal has pleaded guilty and, although not at the first opportunity and in face of an overwhelming Crown case, I do give her some credit for that plea. She has been co-operative in providing information by the means of which the authorities have been able to ascertain the extent of her criminal behaviour, as I said. She has commenced repaying the funds and undertaken to pay a substantial amount back which she owes. 
       
       
      35. I am obliged by s17A of the  
      Crimes Act 1914 
       of the Commonwealth not to pass a sentence of imprisonment unless after having considered all other available sentences, I am satisfied that no other sentence is available in all the circumstances of the case. Other sentences not involving imprisonment would be a fine or a bond or a community service order. Mrs Jabreal is unsuitable for a community service order. A fine, in my opinion, would simply be inadequate to reflect the serious nature of her offending behaviour. Not only that, but it would effectively deprive her of the capacity to repay the debt. A bond, or some form of conditional release unattached to a custodial order, in my opinion, would be also too lenient. I have that opinion because of the authorities which I have referred to,  
      Purdon 
       being just one example. The Court of Criminal Appeal has made it clear that these kinds of offences must attract a custodial sentence. Hence for those reasons, I regard no other sentence than a custodial sentence as appropriate.  
       
       
      36. I turn now to consider two things. What is an appropriate sentence and, secondly, what form the sentence should take. I have been assisted by some references to other cases where courts have sentenced for these kinds of offences and where the Court of Criminal Appeal in this State has reviewed those sentences. Ms McKenzie, in particular, has referred to  
      Regina v Martinsen 
       [2003] NSWCCA 144,  
      Regina v Hayman 
        
      [2003] NSWCCA 138,  
      Regina v Molesworth 
       [1999] NSWCCA 43 and  
      Regina v Janceski 
        
      NSWCCA, unreported, 1 March 1996. Two of those cases involved s29B offences but none of them involved s135.1 offences. Nevertheless, I have taken them into account. 
       
       
      37. I would regard a sentence of the region of two years as an appropriate sentence overall for the kind of criminal behaviour which Mrs Jabreal has engaged in. I came to that view by reference to these precedents, so to speak, to which I have referred. But I also take into account, so far as the length of the sentence is concerned, that Mrs Jabreal’s behaviour was driven by need not greed, and I also give her significant benefit for the fact that she voluntarily ceased her criminal activity and disclosed it to the authorities. I also take into account her plea of guilty. For those reasons, I propose to fix a sentence of eighteen months. 
       
       
      38. The next question is what form that sentence should take. Because of Mrs Jabreal’s age and because of the fact that will be her first sentence of imprisonment and that she has a clean record, I propose to order that her sentence be served by way of periodic detention.  
       
       
      39. I regard, and I use this expression not technically but in general terms, an appropriate minimum period during which Mrs Jabreal should serve her periodic detention as six months. That is what I have in mind: a sentence of eighteen months, to be served by periodic detention, with a minimum component of six months.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Now, I will just suspend my remarks on sentence, at this stage, to get your assistance as to - well, first to make sure I haven’t contravened any statute so far. You are probably more familiar with-- 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: The only thing that is left for your Honour to do, in my submission, is to fix a recognizance release order. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Exactly. Now is that-- 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Twenty - the recognizance provision is s21(a), that is what you default back to when you are actually fixing-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Under three years so-- 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, yes. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: --it is 19, isn’t it? 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: It’s 19. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: I’m grateful to my friend for assistance. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: No, no, you haven’t got it because I have got it. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: I haven’t got it in front of me, your Honour. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Your Honour, if you just pardon me a moment?  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I found it at lunchtime. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: It’s 19(a)(b) or (a)(c), from memory, your Honour. Somewhere in that neighbourhood. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Good, good I’ll find it. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: 19(a)(c)(1)(b): 
       
       
        
        “The court imposes a sentence not exceeding three years.” 
         
        
       
      HIS HONOUR: That’s right, the court must make a recognizance release order. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Yes. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: And I don’t fix a non-parole period. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: No. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Okay. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: And then in terms of the recognizance release order, itself, your Honour has to go back to s20(1)(b) and (a). So if, in fact, it is your Honour’s intention that Mrs Jabreal be sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen months, to be served by way of period detention but directed that she be released after serving six months, upon entry into a recognizance in whatever amount your Honour specifies, to be of good behaviour for whatever period your Honour specifies, and your Honour has to go back to s21(b) and s21(a) for the construction, if you like. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: It’s (b), isn’t it? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, (b) that deals with fixing a term of imprisonment and then-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: (a) is releasing them without-- 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: And releasing them. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: But (b) is where I sentence the person to imprisonment. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: That is correct. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: And I direct by order that the person be released - by giving security - the kind referred to in (a). 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s correct, your Honour, yes, and unlike the State regime, your Honour is actually required to express an amount of security, although it is usually in terms of without having to pay that security. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Let’s see how I go. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Your Honour, the only other thing that I would mention, if you don’t mind, is your Honour’s explicit indication that the sentences are run concurrent. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Thanks, yes, yes. Thank you for that. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s a matter for your Honour, of course. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: It is. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Only if that is what your Honour had in mind. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: No, no, what I have - no, you’re quite right. What I had in mind - and I’ll perhaps invite submissions on this - three cumulative sentences of two years for the s29B offences, and three - two months - two months. Three cumulative sentences of two months in respect of the 29B offences and three cumulative sentences of four months for the 135 offences, which reflects the different maximums, and the fact that they are separate discrete offences, each of them, so that would be two plus two plus two is six, and then on top of that four plus four plus four is 12, which is 18 months in total. Is that going to work or not? 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Your Honour, I hope I’m not appearing impertinent because-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: No, please. 
       
       
      MCKENZIE: Your Honour, I only heard you say I had in mind, words to the effect of an overall sentence of-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Eighteen months. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Eighteen months. Now, that is the only reason I mention it. I think that there may be some difficulty in spacing them out. I can’t see immediately the legal problem within the legislation. Your Honour would have to effectively sentence her, specify the date of commencing, the date of release - the date of commence, the date of release- the date of commencing, the date of release - if that is what your Honour intended. So, there would have to be a distinct pronunciation of commencement ending and so forth. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: At each of the six-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I appreciate that. I’m just wondering what is the alternative to what sentence-- 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well, another approach, in my respectful-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: --concurrent six months and concurrent 12 months. Now what were you going to say, Ms McKenzie? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well, what I was going to submit to your Honour is that if your Honour were looking at imposing the penalty of 18 months to serve six months, your Honour could do that in respect of each of the individual six offences, and just direct that they all commence today. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: The difficulty with that is that the maximum for the 135 is five years. That’s a significant difference. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: That is certainly correct. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: My own view is that it is not appropriate to give the same sentence for the 135s as it is for the 29Bs. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Well, it - because your Honour would have to look at the maximum and then say to yourself, well, where does this sit in the objective seriousness. With respect, we’ve heard all of that but, in effect, it may be seen that your Honour, as a matter of convenience, is sentencing her that way. All that I am saying is that if your Honour’s intent is an overall sentence, then either your Honour make it clear that it is to be served concurrent or as the Crown and I have already indicated, each sentence has to be specified. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: One after the other. Why couldn’t I sentence three concurrent six months in respect of the 29Bs, and three concurrent 12 months in respect of the 135s cumulative on the first lot so, I’ve got two sets of concurrent sentences? I could do that. I am inviting submissions. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Yes, with the overall intention that - to use the phrase loosely - the minimum being six months. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: It is always that. The minimum is six - the intention is the sentence is 18 months, the minimum is six months, and it is periodic detention. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Yes, your Honour, I don’t see a difficulty with that. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: So we’re just talking about the form in which I sentence. To my mind the 135 offences have to carry a heavier sentence because of the significant difference in the maximum for the cumulative thing. That’s how I-- 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Could I just clarify with your Honour? Would your Honour propose that in respect of each block of three offences, that your Honour’s maximum would be the same? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, yes. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: So 18 months, to be released after serving six months in respect of the 29B offences and-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Sorry to interrupt you. What my associate has helpfully done, because I gave her an indication before I came on to the bench of what I was thinking and what I was likely to do, is she has set out with all the dates - so if I was to - but it will date from next Friday because it is periodic detention - next Saturday - and I’ll do them all cumulatively, and then I direct the sentence is served by periodic detention. I’m not giving these orders yet, I’m just giving you an idea. And then I direct that she be released to recognizance after six months on certain conditions, which I will come to. So does anyone see a problem if I do it that way? 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: I don’t your Honour, not from my perspective. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Six cumulative sentences, release after six months. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Could I just have a moment with my friend, your Honour? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Did your Honour use the word, cumulative, or, concurrent? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Cumulative. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: That means one adding to the other to the other? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, yes, or adding up to 18 months. Two plus two-- 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: I see, but in terms of the minimums. See that’s the difficulty that the Crown and I-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, tell me? 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: If your Honour was to make the overall sentence cumulative, one on top of the other, they are 18 months times six. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: No, no, no. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Cumulative? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Four months, plus four-- 
       
       
      MCKENZIE: I see, four plus four. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Plus four, plus two, plus two, plus two. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: My mistake, your Honour I misunderstood it. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: So, there are six sentences, one for each offence. Each of the 29Bs is a two months sentence, each of the 135s is a four months sentence, and they are all cumulatively on each other. It just seems to me that that reflects (a) the maximum and (b) the-- 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Yes, and then so far as the minimum - or the period to be served is concerned, that is the difficulty that we have-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Now, what is the difficulty? 
       
      NEMATALLA: The difficulty in how the minimum - and we’re using that terminology loosely - is then to be served. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, I was wondering that. Isn’t that the subject of a s19AC order? 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: It is, so then with respect, your Honour, your Honour would be saying, for example, with respect to the first offence under 29B, she is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two months, to commence from such and such a date, expire on such and such a date, to be released on a recognizance on a particular date. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Now, that’s right. I think I’m right here but tell me if I’m wrong. You both might look at 19AC says: 
       
       
        
        “Where a person is convicted of two or more Federal offences at the same sitting--“ 
         
        
       
      Yes: 
       
       
        
        “--and the court imposes on the person Federal sentences that in the aggregate do not exceed three years--“ 
         
        
       
      Yes: 
       
       
        
        “--and at the time the sentences are imposed, a person is not already subject to a Federal sentence--“ 
         
        
       
      Yes: 
       
       
        
        “--the court must make a recognizance release order in respect of those sentences and must not fix a non-parole period.” 
         
        
       
      So what I think I can do is make one recognizance release order. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: In fact, that’s what both the Crown and I would ask your Honour to do. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: In respect of all the sentences. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Yes.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Did I state that right, Madam Crown? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, it is correct, as my friend points out. There must be a single non-release period, if I can put it that way. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, exactly, all right. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: With a single recognizance order, if that is repeating what you are saying. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, all right, we might get underway. We will have another conference shortly. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Yes. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I have just spoken to my friend. I still have a lingering concern as to what your Honour proposes is, in fact, possible in accordance with what the statute provides. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I will hear you, that’s an important point. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: But what I’ve just pointed out to my friend, and my friend is happy for me to raise this with your Honour, is that your Honour has the capacity, should your Honour desire to do so, when your Honour has in mind that someone is to be directed to serve six months or less, your Honour is not required to fix a recognizance release order. That is provided for in s19AC(3).  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Right. What is the point - what’s your point? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: That might overcome - your Honour may well be able to achieve what your Honour has in mind to achieve in terms of this conglomeration of penalties. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Without activating my concern that what your Honour proposes in terms of two, plus two, plus two, and then four, plus four, plus four. I’m just not convinced, your Honour, that that’s - I know that there is this requirement to have a single recognizance release period, but I’m not certain that the current means by which your Honour proposes to do that is not going to offend the legislation. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: And how would subsection (3) of s19AC help there because I’m imposing sentences exceeding six months. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: I wonder if your Honour would give me the opportunity to make an inquiry with my office before your Honour goes ahead and imposes judgment? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Just so I could-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, we’ve got to get it right. That’s fine, Ms McKenzie. Look I appreciate your assistance, both of you in this, and look I’m not overlooking the fact that your client, Mr Nematella, is sitting there obviously quite distressed. Unfortunately this is - as I’m sure you’ve explained - an important part of sentencing. She knows what I have in mind, what the result is going to be, but these mechanical things unfortunately just - we have to get them right or she might find herself in the Court of Criminal Appeal wanting, you know, to correct it. 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: No, without pre-empting anything, I explained what the intent of your Honour’s overall punishment will be, but it’s a matter of doing it right in terms of what needs to be on paper, your Honour, and she understands that. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: But I just acknowledge that she’s obviously distressed by this - by (a) the sentence or the news and (b) the fact that we - the process. So should I adjourn for a couple of minutes? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Would your Honour give me that indulgence? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I will. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Thank you, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I’d appreciate it. 
       
       
      SHORT ADJOURNMENT 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Well, how did we go? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: I thank your Honour for that time. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Just say that again? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: I thank you Honour for that time. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, yes. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: I’ve checked with my office and what your Honour proposed is acceptable. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Right, okay. It’s not going to breach the statute? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: But what would be required as part of that process, is that your Honour would be required, because of s19, to specify the start and end dates for each sentence. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I’ve got that. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Thank you. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: My associate anticipated that. So are we ready to go? 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: Yes, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: You’d better ask your - no, leave her there, leave here there. Mrs Jabreal, it’s all right. 
       
       
      40. I sentence you in respect of the offence of dishonestly causing a loss to a Commonwealth entity, contrary to s135.1 of the  
      Criminal Code 
        
      1995 
      , to four months imprisonment, to date from 3 November 2007 and to expire on 2 March 2008. In respect of the second offence of dishonestly causing a loss to a Commonwealth entity, contrary to the same section, I sentence you to four months imprisonment to date from 3 March 2008 and to expire on 2 July 2008. That period is to be cumulative on the first period. In respect of the third offence of dishonestly causing a loss to a Commonwealth entity, contrary to the same section, I sentence you to a further term of four months imprisonment, to date from 3 July 2008 and to expire on 2 November 2008. That is to be cumulative on the previous two sentences.  
       
       
      41. In respect of the offence of imposition on the Commonwealth, contrary to s29B of the  
      Crimes Act 1914 
      , I sentence you to two months imprisonment to date from 3 November 2008 and to expire on 2 January 2009. That is to be cumulative on all the previous sentences. In respect of the second offence of imposition on the Commonwealth contrary to the same section, I sentence you to two months imprisonment to date from 3 January 2009 and to expire on 2 March 2009. That sentence is to be cumulative on all the other sentences. In respect of the third offence of imposition on the Commonwealth, contrary to the same section, I sentence you to two months imprisonment to date from 3 March 2009 and to expire on 2 May 2009. That is to be cumulative on all the other sentences. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Now, what is the section about periodic detention, because I will make a direction? 20AB, is it? 
       
       
      42. In respect of all of the sentences which I have just imposed, I make a periodic detention order directing that those sentences be served by way of periodic detention. I fix the date of commencement of the sentence as 3 November 2007. I direct that you attend the Norma Parker Periodic Detention Centre at 1 Fleet Street, Parramatta, on Saturday, 3 November 2007, at 8.30am, and at 7pm each Friday thereafter.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Now I go to what was it 19AC? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Now the recognizance release order is a conditional one, is that right? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well, one of the automatic conditions, your Honour, I think is to be of good behaviour. It is in your Honour’s hands as to whether your Honour wishes to express any other conditions of that release. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. Is there any provision about - it’s a s19AC. Is that subsection (1)? 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: For the recognizance, your Honour, I think it is (2) - AC(2). Sorry, it is A(1), your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, A(1). 
       
       
      NEMATALLA: AC(1). 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: AC(1), yes. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: And then your Honour goes to s20(1)(b). 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: That’s right, that’s what I couldn’t remember, thanks.  
       
       
      NEMATALLA: For the conditions, yes. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: 21(b)? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: 20(1)(b), your Honour.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: 21 doesn’t exist. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: 20(1)(b), your Honour. 
       
      43. Pursuant to s19AC of the  
      Crimes Act 1914 
      , I make a recognizance release order in respect of the sentences which I have just imposed. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: And do I specify the order? 
       
       
      NEMATELLA: To commence and the conditions, yes, your Honour. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, yes, your Honour. Your Honour would indicate the period at the conclusion of which the offender is to be released upon entering into that recognizance, self, in a nominated sum. That’s at your Honour’s discretion. To be of good behaviour for the period that your Honour nominates. 
       
       
      44. Pursuant to s20(1)(b) I direct by order that Mrs Jabreal be released after she has served a period of six months imprisonment in respect of those offences. She is to be released upon giving security without surety by recognizance that she will comply with the following conditions: One, that she will be of good behaviour for a period of eighteen months from 3 November 2007.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Now, any other conditions that either of you recommend. 
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Did your Honour express the end date of that six month period? 
       
       
      45. So the specified period of imprisonment after which she is to be released, commences on 3 November 2007 and expires on 2 May 2008, at which time she is to be released by my order. 
       
       
      NEMATELLA: Your Honour, just with the order of good behaviour for the total period, did your Honour intend that, or did you intend that she be of good behaviour for the balance, because if it commences today-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: That makes more sense, doesn’t it? 
       
      NEMATELLA: So that, in my respectful submission, it would commence on the date of her release for a period of-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Twelve months. 
       
       
      NEMATELLA: Yes. 
       
       
      46. The good behaviour period is for twelve months to commence on 3 May 2008 and to conclude 2 May 2009.  
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: There was also the need for your Honour to express a monetary amount for the recognizance.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Is that usual? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: It is required under the Commonwealth legislation, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Is it? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, it is, under section 20(1)(a). It can be any amount, your Honour, there is no magic to the figure. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Where is the requirement? I’ve got your practice. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: I might have to - if I could speak to my friend, your Honour? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes.  
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Upon giving security, your Honour. It’s expressed in the terms of section 20(1)(a) and it goes on to say with or without sureties-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: But the security is the money? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: That is correct, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Well, what is a usual amount? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: It could be anything. It could be $100, it could be $1000. It’s completely in your Honour’s discretion as to the monetary amount. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: But she doesn’t have to pay it. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: She doesn’t have to pay it. 
       
       
      47. I fix that as $500, the security. 
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Now some supplementary orders you have sought? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Firstly, your Honour, as to reparation under section 21B in favour of the Commonwealth.  
       
       
      48. In addition to the penalties, which I have imposed, pursuant to s21B of the  
      Crimes Act 1914 
      , I order Mrs Jabreal to make reparation to the Commonwealth by way of money payment in respect of the balance unpaid, representing the loss suffered by the Commonwealth by reason of the offence. That reparation should be in the amount of $56,991.29.  
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: And the final remaining order, your Honour, that the Crown sought was for fingerprints to be taken pursuant to section 3ZL of the  
      Commonwealth Crimes Act 
      . 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: This Commonwealth Crimes Act needs a bit of tidying up, doesn’t it? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: I wouldn’t disagree with your Honour in that regard. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: What should she do, attend the police station to do it? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour, within - I think it is a seven day period provided for by the section. Any police station but in terms of the convenience of Mrs Jabreal, perhaps the one closest to where she resides might-- 
       
       
      49. Pursuant to s3ZL of the  
      Crimes Act 
      , I order that Mrs Jabreal attend any police station in New South Wales within one month of today to allow impressions of her fingerprints to be taken in accordance with this order. Anything else? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, thank you, your Honour, that completes the orders sought by the Crown. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Mr Nematella? 
       
       
      NEMATELLA: Nothing on behalf of the offender, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Thanks, Mr Nematella. Now, I think I have to explain to your client that periodic detention - what happens if you breach a periodic detention order? 
       
       
      NEMATELLA: Your Honour, that’s an administrative process undertaken by-- 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, it’s not actually. 
       
       
      NEMATELLA: It’s not? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: It’s not in the Commonwealth domain. What happens, your Honour, is-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I know it’s not in the Commonwealth domain. I’m just looking through  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       of New South Wales. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, it’s provided for under section 20AC, as I recall it, of the  
      Commonwealth Crimes Act 
      . 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, I remember that, that’s my power to-- 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: If there is a breach then a Court Attendance Notice will be issued. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Okay. 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: And the matter would be brought before the court and then the Judge or the Magistrate, depending on what jurisdiction you’re in, then has a number of options as enumerated by the section, one of which could be re-sentencing, one of which is to do nothing and, as I recall it, there is also a provision there for fining the offender as well. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: So basically she could be re-sentenced? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s correct, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Including full-time obviously? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Correct, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, okay. Ms Manna would you explain this to Ms Jabreal, and you can both remain seated? Mrs Jabreal, I have sentenced you to eighteen months because of the crimes which you committed. You are to serve that by way of weekend gaol, but the weekend gaol finishes after six months. After six months there will be no weekend gaol but you must be of good behaviour for the last twelve months.  
       
       
      You must attend every weekend for weekend gaol from next Saturday, 3 November. If you fail to comply with the order, you will be brought back to the court and what might happen is you could be re-sentenced and you could get a worse sentence. So, it is very important that you go to your weekend gaol. Do you understand that? 
       
       
      OFFENDER: Yes. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Okay, all right. I will just return your Crimes Act, thanks, Ms McKenzie. So nothing else? 
       
       
      CROWN PROSECUTOR: Not from the Commonwealth’s point of view, thank you, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: All right, I notice it is a quarter to 5. So can I just - the court officer is still here and the monitor. Can I thank them both very much? It has been important to me to resolve this, and these Commonwealth matters are not straight forward, and I also am grateful for your assistance, Ms McKenzie and your assistance, Mr Nematella. It has been not easy, so thank you both very much, and my associate as well, so thank you. I will now adjourn. 
       
       
       
       oOo

    SENTENCE 
    1 In any civilised society women must be able to go about their daily business free from the risk that they will be kidnapped and violated by a man intent on having sex with them. Many women, like the complainant in this case, are unable to fight back against a stronger man who has planned and prepared his crime well. What makes crimes such as those I am about to describe particularly frightening is that, realistically, there is nothing that a woman can do to avoid it, short of never being in public alone, a clearly unrealistic alternative. 2 One thing which can be done however is for the Courts to react appropriately to offences of this kind, not only to deter others who might be tempted to give in to their lustful desires by dragging a woman off the street and raping her, but also to mark in a very concrete way the right of women to be free to live their lives in safety.3 What happened to a young woman I will call Ms S happened a long time ago but I have no doubt that the offences have had, and will continue to have, an enormous impact on her life. 4 Ms S worked as a check out operator at a supermarket in Maitland. One day she went to work and, as she always did, parked her car in the Council car park near to her place of employment. On the 2nd of October 1997 there was a man waiting for her. He wasn’t waiting for her in particular but was waiting for a woman so that he could kidnap, drug and rape her. Unfortunately for Ms S it was she who was chosen. 5 She drove into the car park at about 10.15 am. The offender had been waiting for an appropriate victim for more than an hour by this time. She got out of her car and was approached by the offender. He had a rubber glove on his right hand and was carrying a black sports bag. He asked Ms S the time and when she replied, he presented a knife towards her saying “if you do what I tell you, you won’t get hurt”. She begged him, saying “don’t do this to me” but the offender simply grabbed her car keys from her hand and opened the boot of the car. He then forced her into the boot before locking it and driving Ms S away. 6 This was the beginning of a terrifying, violent, and lengthy period in which she was held captive by the offender. 7 Ms S was aware that the car was travelling for some time. In fact the offender drove to an isolated location until he stopped the car for the purposes of doing things to Ms S which would make her more compliant with what he had planned. He first began to tie Ms S using yellow duct tape, wrapping it around her forearms, ankles and lower legs. He also put the tape over her eyes. He forced some tablets into Ms S’s mouth saying, “these will help you sleep so you won’t remember as much and it won’t hurt”. He also provided her with alcohol to drink. He then gagged her with duct tape preventing her from opening her lips or calling for help. The offender explained what he was doing. He said, “I’m not going to hurt you; I just want to have sex ‘cause I have problems with girls”.8 The boot was again closed and Ms S was again trapped inside. The offender took Ms S to the garage of the home where he lived with his wife and children, they being out at the time. It was a hot day and Ms S became increasingly groggy from the effects of the tablets and alcohol she had been forced to consume. She was also very hot and sweaty in the boot and not surprisingly very terrified at what had occurred and what was about to occur. 9 Once they got to the offender’s garage the offender opened the boot of the car. The statement of facts records that at this stage Ms S “felt paralysed by fear, so great was her terror"". Unfortunately mere words such as these cannot convey adequately I am sure just what it was Ms S was feeling. 10 The offender removed the tape from Ms S’ mouth asked her if she had a boyfriend and said “kiss me like I’m your boyfriend”. He then forced his mouth onto hers and pushed his tongue inside her mouth. He then put his penis in Ms S’ mouth before placing her on her side on the floor of the garage. At this stage Ms S’ legs and arms were still bound and her eyes were still taped over so that she could not see. She knew full well what was going to happen but in order to discourage the offender she told him that she was menstruating. The offender replied that he did not care and simply removed a tampon from Ms S’ vagina. 11 Ms S has difficulty recalling precisely what it was that occurred because of the effects of the alcohol and drugs upon her but she realised that at some stage the offender had removed her underpants and that her long skirt was bunched up around her waist. She recalls that the offender pushed his penis inside Ms S’ vagina and moved it in and out for a minute or so before pulling it out. The offender then turned Ms S onto her stomach and reinserted his penis into her vagina from behind. It seems that the offender ejaculated. He then had the presence of mind to do something which was both disgustingly degrading and intended to minimise the chance that his identity would be revealed. He got a liquid, something like methylated spirits, and he used it to wipe down Ms S’ body and flush out her vagina. Clearly the offender was minimising the chances that he would leave behind anything which could identify him. 12 Later on when the offender was arrested suggestions were made that at the time he was acting in a confused state. The activity I have just described suggests, quite to the contrary, that the offender was acting very rationally indeed.13 At this stage the offender demanded to know Ms S’ mother’s telephone number as well as the pin numbers for her ATM cards. He stole jewellery from her and then reapplied the tape across her mouth. He then put her back into the boot of her car, bound and gagged, and drove off. He took the car to the Esplanade at Lorn, a quiet street near to the bridge over the Hunter River. There he abandoned both Ms S and her car. She was left trapped in the boot of her car drugged and tied up on a hot day, and it would turn out to be something in the order of 2 hours before she was eventually freed. 14 Ms S’ mother got a telephone call from the offender at 12.30 pm, the offender told her that her daughter had not turned up to work that morning. As might be expected this caused Ms S’s mother considerable anguish. She told her husband what had occurred. Ms S’ boyfriend was there as well and they began a fruitless search for Ms S or her car. Police were involved and they too began to search. Ms S' mother returned home in distress and at about 2.30 pm got another telephone call from the offender. In this call he finally told her where Ms S’ car was. Whilst Ms S’ mother called the police her aunt telephoned her husband and asked him to go to Lorn. He found Ms S’ car, telephoned police, and opened the boot. There he found Ms S bound, drugged and almost completely naked. He thought she was dead. Ms S was taken by ambulance to the John Hunter Hospital where she was examined by a doctor. She had a number of injuries which are set out in both the statement of facts and in a certificate under s177 of the Evidence Act signed by Dr Cheryn Palmer. I will return to those injuries later.15 That same night between 7.30 and 8.00 pm the offender again phoned Ms S’ home telephone. Her aunt answered the call and heard the offender ask, “did you find Emma yet”. It is easy to overlook the significance of that call. Apart from one telephone call made about 2.30 earlier that afternoon the offender had made no other steps in the intervening 5 hours or so to ensure Ms S’ release from the position that he had put her in. 16 The offender not only took property from Ms S’ person and her car but over the next few days withdrew substantial sums of money from her bank accounts. 17 Forensic analysis of Ms S’ blood determined the presence of alcohol, paracetamol, morphine and codeine. The level of codeine in Ms S’ blood was high and well outside the therapeutic range suggesting that she had ingested a very large dose. 18 About 2 weeks after she was abducted and raped Ms S made what would later turn out to be a very significant discovery. She saw what appeared to be blood in 2 areas of her car and so she took the car to Maitland police station where samples of that blood were taken. Her presence of mind ultimately led to proof that it was the offender who was responsible for committing these terrible offences.19 Police investigations in an attempt to identify the identity of the person who had abducted and raped Ms S were unsuccessful. In 1998 a man by the name of David Andrade was arrested and charged with these offences. His arrest received a great deal of publicity in the Maitland area but, fortunately, the prosecution of him for these offences was terminated by the Director of Public Prosecutions. It looked therefore as though the case would never be solved.20 That was until police received information from a woman then living with the offender, Ms Sarannah Hawkins. They both worked for a company called Regal Motors. In late 2004 that company planned a series of television advertisements and the offender was asked to participate in those advertisements. This would have meant that his face would be shown on television in the Newcastle area. He refused to participate in those advertisements. He explained to Ms Hawkins “I don’t want my face on local television. I did something a long time ago that I’m not proud of and I don’t want to be put in a position that I could be recognised”.21 Some weeks later Ms Hawkins asked the offender what it was that he had done in the past and he told her “I raped a girl from Maitland”. He then gave Ms Hawkins some information about what he remembered doing, which suggested that he had a reasonably good memory of the events. He also told her that he had the impression that his victim actually enjoyed what he was doing to her. When asked why he had done it he told Ms Hawkins that he had been bitten by a funnel-web spider and was having headaches at the time and was an angry person. It is worth noting at this stage that there is no evidence from any person close to him at the time that he was particularly angry around the time he committed this offence. Indeed the evidence from his former wife was to the contrary. The offender also told Ms Hawkins what he had done with the methylated spirits: to be precise he said, “I washed her out with metho”. When she asked him whether he was worried about being caught he told Ms Hawkins that he didn’t have to worry about that because the police had charged some bloke with his crime and he had therefore gotten away with it.22 In September 2005 Ms Hawkins gave to police an item which had on it the offender’s DNA. Forensic scientists were thus able to compare the offender’s DNA with that removed from the blood stained carpet of Mr S’ car way back in October 1997. They proved to be identical and so it was the offender was arrested on 14 December 2005 at his place of employment. He was taken to Newcastle police station where he said, “I don’t know what to say or how to say whatever but, yes, you have got the right person”. The offender again repeated his explanation that he had been bitten by a funnel-web spider whilst walking through knee length grass.23 Hospital records show that the offender was admitted to Bulahdelah Hospital on 20 September 1997 and it was thought that he had possibly suffered a spider bite. He was treated with antivenin and other drugs and transferred to Newcastle Hospital. He was discharged shortly thereafter with hospital notes quoting the offender saying that he felt normal.24 Dr Geoffrey Isbister, a Clinical Toxicologist with expertise in the effects of spider bites, has reviewed the material and has concluded that his medical presentation on 20 September 1997 was not consistent with either a bite from a funnel-web or red back spider. He also goes onto state, without challenge from the accused, that there are no reported incidents in the medical literature to suggest that a funnel-web spider bite can be responsible for extreme depression, ongoing agitation, anger and hatred.25 So it is perhaps unlikely that the offender’s condition when he was at Bulahdelah hospital on 20 September 1997 was in fact due to being bitten by a spider. In any case he returned again to hospital shortly after being discharged complaining of headache and sensitivity to light. No abnormality was detected but he was diagnosed with possibly suffering from a viral illness with meningeal irritation, he was discharged 4 days later after his symptoms resolved. Although the offender claims that he was unwell following discharge from hospital he didn’t consult his general practioner until 16 September 1998 almost a year later.26 The offender is now 41 years of age and, most importantly, has no relevant criminal history. The evidence established that these most serious offences were very much out of character for him. He appears to have been in every other respect a man of good character, a hard worker, a family man and a loving and caring father who doted on his children. His current wife and his former wife both said that he had never been violent towards him and indeed because of his father’s violence, the offender was himself very much against violence. 27 It is truly remarkable that a man such as this offender committed such terrible and serious crimes and has committed no other crime of any similar nature since then. 28 In those circumstances it is natural to look for an explanation. As I have mentioned the offender seems to focus on his belief that he was bitten by a spider shortly before he committed these offences but whether he was bitten by a spider or suffering viral meningitis there is still no reasonable explanation for his behaviour apart from the one he offered to the complainant before he raped her, namely when he said “I just want to have sex”. 29 Mr Rosser who appeared for the offender pressed upon me a finding that there was a connection between whatever illness the offender was suffering in September 1997 and his offences in early October. He relies in particular on the following passage in a report from Dr Westmore: 
     
      
       
       “the brain is… a very complex organ and medical practioners and related scientists still do not fully understand how the brain works. I am of the opinion that on the balance of probability this man’s acute brain syndrome played some role in the genesis of his offending behaviour. The absence of any subsequent or previous behaviour of such an extreme nature or that type supports that proposition and on balance I do not think that he has an anti-social personality disorder. Such a personality disorder might be associated with the offending behaviour but again one would expect the other evidence of that personality type and that does not appear to be the case with Mr Spiers”.  
       
      
    30 I do not accept Dr Westmore’s conclusion that his medical state in September 1997 “played some role in the genesis of his offending behaviour”. I will explain why. The primary reason is the absence of any evidence at all suggesting that there has ever been a connection, apart from the one postulated as probable by Dr Westmore, between spider bites or viral meningitis and terribly violent crimes such as this one. There is no evidence put before me to suggest that spider bites or viral meningitis can pre-dispose a person to commit sexual offences, or indeed to commit any offences at all. One might have expected, with viral meningitis and bites from spiders being common enough, that if there was a connection between such events and criminal behaviour it would have been identified before now. 31 Dr Westmore’s’ opinion is, as he fairly recognises, based on the proposition that this offender did something which was quite unusual for him and to look for an explanation for that. The only possible explanation according to Dr Westmore is what he describes as “acute brain syndrome” but in the absence of any explanation as to how it is that such a syndrome leads to offending behaviour such as this and in the absence of recorded examples in the medical literature Dr Westmore’s opinion cannot be accepted. What Dr Westmore has done is to look for an explanation for this offender acting out of character and hit upon the most likely medical explanation. What he ignores is that people do act out of character on occasions without there being any medical cause at all. Mr Rosser says that it is too big a coincidence for the admission to hospital and the offending to be unrelated but this is flawed reasoning. There is a natural human tendency to seek connections in events where in truth there is no connection between them. This natural human tendency is especially prominent where what is sought to be explained is aberrant behaviour. The mere fact that 2 events are temporally related to each other does not establish that one caused the other.32 So I will sentence the offender on the basis that his admission to hospital on the 20th and 22nd of September 1997, and the condition he was in at that time, does not explain these offences. The offender didn’t commit these offences because he was bitten by a spider, he didn’t commit these offences because he was suffering from viral meningitis, he committed these offences because he wanted to have sex.33 It is quite apparent that these offences were well planned. The offender was not at work being at home on sick leave. He took advantage of an opportunity which presented itself when his wife and children were not home. He obtained a knife, a glove, and duct tape all for the purposes of putting into effect his plan. 34 The offender pleaded guilty to 3 offences. They are kidnapping, using a stupefying drug with intent to commit an indictable offence and aggravated sexual assault. When I sentence him for the second of those matters he asks that I take into account 4 matters on a form 1 each arising as a result of the commission of the offences on the indictment those matters are; obtain benefit by deception, aggravated robbery, obtain benefit by deception and assault. 35 There is one important matter that I have to resolve. It concerns the maximum penalty for the kidnapping offence. That is either 14 years or 20 years imprisonment depending on whether it has been shown to me by the accused on the balance of probabilities that Ms S was released without suffering substantial injury. During the course of submissions various issues were raised, in particular whether psychological injury was sufficient or whether the rape itself could amount to an injury. It would be entirely consistent with the policy behind the differential penalty for a kidnapping offence for both psychologic injury and the rape itself to be sufficient to justify the higher penalty. After all the policy reason was that kidnappers should be encouraged to release their victims unharmed and it is difficult in the extreme to say that Ms S, who was violently raped by the offender, was not harmed by that experience. 36 However I need not resolve those matters because I am satisfied that physical injuries suffered by Ms S were substantial. When examined by a doctor after being taken to hospital the following abnormalities were detected.· Her face, especially cheeks and chin, were reddened but not tender· Her left nipple was inflamed, reddened and tender· She had superficial grazes on both elbows· Her right forearm had a linear red mark encircling her forearm· On her left forearm there were 2 linear red marks · She had multiple superficial linear grazes over her back and upper left buttock· She was bruised on her left buttock too· She had superficial grazing to both knees· On her right lower leg she had a linear red graze· And on her left lower leg she had a blood stippled graze· Her external genitalia was swollen, inflamed and tender with the labia being particularly swollen.37 Whilst perhaps those injuries that I have immediately just referred to would not, individually, amount to substantial injury when taken together I am satisfied that they do accurately fit that description. I make this finding based on my consideration of the injuries and my understanding of what the Court of Criminal Appeal has said about the meaning of substantial injury in R v Rowe (1996) A Crim R 467. In that case Hunt CJ at CL said (at 472): 
     
      
       
      “The physical injuries which the complainant suffered were minor, but an injury caused to a woman by violence inflicted during or associated with sexual intercourse without consent, and particularly when the woman is being detained against her will, is capable of amounting to serious injury within the meaning of s 90A. It was submitted that “injury”, in the context of the Crimes Act, must be a physical injury. Be that as it may, assault which produces minor physical consequences may well become substantial where the circumstances in which it was inflicted (as here) greatly affect its seriousness”. 
      
    38 The maximum penalty for the kidnapping offence is thus 20 years imprisonment.39 Having identified the maximum penalty it’s now appropriate to address some of the particular features of the offender’s conduct which make his kidnapping offence a most serious example of a most serious offence. 40 In R v Collett Unreported CCA 7 June 1979 the Court set out 4 factors which were important in assessing sentence for kidnapping offences. The first concerns the length of time which the victim is detained. In this case it appears to have been something in the order of 4 hours between the time Ms S was taken and the time she was released. This is not a case where she was detained for a matter of only minutes. 41 The next matter suggested in Collett concerns the extent of the fear or terror which was occasioned and what happened to the victim whilst she was held captive. Of course I have to be careful here not to double count because what happened to Ms S is the subject of separate offences. With that qualification it is important to remember the very great terror that Ms S would have felt and the degrading way in which she was treated. It is difficult to imagine how she must have felt being bound and locked in the boot of a car knowing that once the car came to a stop she was going to be raped. 42 The third matter suggested in Collett is the purpose of the detention. Again this is an area where I have to be careful not to double count because all this was done by the offender so that he could have sex with Ms S against her will. 43 The fourth matter suggested in Collett is whether there are other persons who underwent fear or anguish as a result of their knowledge that Ms S had been held captive. In this case that consideration is relevant. The victim’s family was made aware at about noon that she was missing and it was not until 2.30 or thereabouts that they learnt what had happened to her, and in particular that she was alive.44 Objectively this offence of kidnapping is one of the most serious examples of such an offence it is possible to imagine. 45 There is no doubt about the maximum penalty for the next offence I have to consider, that of administering a stupefying substance with intent to commit an indictable offence, that is 25 years imprisonment. The offender’s purpose seems to have been twofold, not only to facilitate the commission of his ultimate intention but also to reduce the chance that he would be detected. Thus Ms S recalls the offender telling her that he was giving her the drugs “so you won’t remember as much”. 46 The gravity of offences such as these is not only that the offender has rendered Ms S unable to resist and made it harder for her to identify him but also there must be due recognition of the fact that the offender appears to have disregarded completely any possible consequences for Ms S of having been forced to take large quantities of drugs which had not been prescribed for her. 47 Of course this offence is the one which has matters on a form 1 attached to it. One of those matters, aggravated robbery, is a most serious offence in its own right but the fact that the offender committed other offences, including one the following day, is important in assessing his overall criminality because of its relevance to the offender’s attitude to what he had done. This is not a case where the offender, having kidnapped, tied up, drugged and raped a young woman immediately felt sorry for what he had done. Instead he took the opportunity of taking as much money as he could from her bank accounts. Nor did he seem to care that she may place sentimental value on the items of jewellery he had taken. Despite telling Ms S’ father that that property would be returned that never happened.48 So now we come to the offence of aggravated sexual assault, an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. This was an offence of penile vaginal intercourse in which the offender ejaculated and, again being careful not to double count was committed by the offender in circumstances where the complainant was helpless to resist.49 As will be obvious from what I have said so far there is a great deal of overlap between the 3 offences with elements of one offence being aggravating features of another but there is only one course of conduct here, albeit a lengthy and seriously criminal one.50 I am satisfied that the offender is remorseful for what he has done. The offender admitted from the outset to police that they had the right person and pleaded guilty at an early stage recognising that by doing so the complainant would be spared the prospect of having to give evidence at a trial. The plea of guilty is not only evidence of remorse, but has a significant utilitarian benefit which should be reflected in the appropriate discount from the sentence I would have otherwise imposed. In order to reflect the utilitarian benefit of the offender’s pleas of guilty I will impose a sentence which is approximately 25% less than it would otherwise have been.51 An important factor of course in this case concerns the fact that these offences were committed almost exactly 10 years ago. This is not a case where the offender has spent every day since then in fear of the knock on the door. He clearly thought as he told Ms Hawkins, that he had got away with it. But on the other hand there was evidence to suggest that at various times in the offender’s life he had been troubled by what he had done and the prospect that eventually this day would come. 52 The delay has also enabled the offender to demonstrate that these offences are most unlikely to be repeated. The fact that there has been nothing of this nature in the last 10 years suggest not only that there are good prospects for rehabilitation but that rehabilitation has already been achieved. 53 Mr Rosser asks that I find special circumstances in this case. I will do so only for the purpose of ensuring that the statutory ratio remains for the overall sentence which necessarily involves partial accumulation. It is important to remember that not only must the head sentence reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct but so must the non-parole period. The effective non-parole period I will shortly announce is the least which I consider properly reflects the gravity of the offender’s conduct. 54 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment as follows:55 For the offence of kidnapping the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period for 4 years to date from the 29th of October 2007 and a head sentence of 6 years.56 For the offence of administering a stupefying drug with intent to commit an indictable offence taking into account the form 1 matters the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 4 years and set a head sentence of 6 years to date from the 29th of October 2008. 57 For the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 4 years to commence on the 29th of October 2009 and a head sentence of 6 years.58 Thus the overall sentence is one of consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years and a head sentence of 8 years. The non-parole period will expire on the 28th of October 2013 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Glenn Kelvin Smith appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty at an earlier stage to an offence against s 91G(2)(a) of the Crimes Act. That is an offence of using a child of or above the age of fourteen for pornographic purposes. A child is defined a person under the age of eighteen. The complainant in this case was sixteen years of age whilst the offender was fifty-seven.2 The complainant lived in the United States of America and the offender lived at Marks Point. They met over the internet, after the offender established contact with the complainant when they were both in an internet Christian chat room. They private messaged each other and a relationship developed. This relationship included them corresponding with each other through the use of email, SMS messages, letters and they also made telephone calls to each other. The relationship commenced around 8 October 2006 and continued until 10 February 2007 when the relationship was reported to police in the United States of America by a friend of the complainant’s.3 Investigations have revealed that the relationship the offender and the complainant became a sexual one quite quickly. The statement of facts records that it was the offender who began sending photos of himself, naked and masturbating, to the complainant before asking her to send similar photos of herself in response to this request. She sent about three hundred digital photographs via the internet. The statement of facts also records that the offender had quite specific requests too. He asked her not to insert objects into her vagina because he wanted to be the one to take her virginity and so he asked her to insert things into her rectum. At his request she did this and sent him photographs of what she was doing.4 Twelve photographs were tendered during the sentencing proceedings. They are photographs of a most graphic and intimate nature. 5 The offender is a fifty-eight year old disability pensioner, he clearly suffers from a significant degree of hearing loss. At the time he committed these offences he was living a somewhat isolated life, spending most of his time surfing the internet or watching television.6 In the course of his evidence before me there was at least a suggestion that the offender considered that the complainant of these offences was partially to blame for their commission. But Mr Hogan who appeared for the offender asked me to sentence the offender on the basis that the responsibility for the offence was solely the offender’s.7 At the conclusion of the first day’s hearing of this matter I raised the issue as to whether there should be a presentence report, specifically addressing the offender’s suitability for community service and periodic detention. That report has now become available. The offender is suitable for neither.8 But of more importance to the present issue is what the offender told the Probation and Parole Service. In complete contrast to the statement of facts tendered to me, without objection from Mr Hogan, the offender now seems to suggest to Probation and Parole, at least, that he was a victim in the matter. He denies that the sexual interaction was initiated by him and he denied that he received any sexual pleasure from the interactions. Given that the statement of facts records that the offender sent photographs of himself naked and masturbating, I completely reject the suggestion that the offender did not receive any sexual pleasure from the interactions. If he in fact was not receiving any sexual pleasure from the interactions, one wonders why the complainant would have continued to send photographs to him. As I have mentioned she sent about three hundred digital photographs via the internet.9 I will read perhaps the most important paragraph of the presentence report in full: 
     
      
      “Mr Smith engaged in victim blaming during the interview in that he reports it was the victim that instigated the sexual photos and actions. He denies part of the police facts in that he was masturbating or requesting that she engage in sexual acts on his behalf. He sees himself as a victim, citing that he “was used as much as he used her”. He reports he “used” her for friendship as he was lonely and depressed. Although claiming to regret his actions, he appears more motivated by being arrested and being denied a future with the victim.” 
      
    10 As Mr Hogan fairly conceded when the matter was before me again today there is much in that presentence report that does not help his client. It reveals a complete failure on the part of the offender to appreciate the seriousness of his conduct. 11 He has taken advantage of the complainant’s youth and naivety. The naivety of the complainant was obvious, she believed that she would eventually leave home, travel to Australia and marry the offender with whom she would have many children. The offender exploited the complainant’s naivety for the purpose of his own sexual gratification. There was a significant imbalance in the level of maturity of the two people involved.12 During the course of submissions I confessed to being somewhat surprised to learn that although it was not an offence for two sixteen year olds to have sexual intercourse, it was an offence if one of them took a photograph of that activity. Such are the curiosities of the Legislature’s attitudes towards the criminal law. But a case such as this demonstrates the vulnerability of sixteen years to exploitation by older men who would prey on them for their own sexual gratification. In the offender’s favour is the circumstance that he was honest with the complainant about his age. He did not pretend to be an eighteen year old by any means. But against that is the evidence suggesting that the offender acquiesced in the young girl’s fantasies, which involved her marrying him and having children with him.13 The offender pleaded guilty at an early stage so I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twenty-five percent, to reflect that circumstance. A plea of guilty can sometimes be evidence of remorse as well. But in circumstances where, as here, the Crown case is overwhelming, a judge often looks for other evidence of remorse before the offender is entitled to an appropriate reduction in sentence. I am satisfied that the offender is sorry because his misconduct has been revealed, he is sorry that he will be punished, he is sorry that he will not be able to continue his relationship with the victim, but I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that he is sorry in the sense that he recognises just how wrong his behaviour was. Indeed, I am satisfied that that is far from the case.14 The offender is not in good health, he suffers from depression, chronic anxiety and emphysema. Related to those illnesses was the circumstance that he was lonely at the time he committed these offences. I recognise that these illnesses, together with his substantial hearing deficit, will make any time in custody much harder than would otherwise be the case.15 One very important factor working in the offender’s favour, is that this is the very first offence he has ever committed. There is a substantial bank of good character on which he is entitled to rely. It tends to suggest his otherwise good character and also to suggest that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. To the contrary, however, are the contents of the probation and parole presentence report, in particular the paragraph that I have outlined. In those circumstances I cannot find that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. It may well be that he has good character in every other respect of his life, but in so far as he encouraged the sixteen year old victim in this case, to take most intimate and graphic photos of herself for his sexual gratification and fails, very importantly, to recognise that she was entirely blameless in these matters, then the offender’s character suffers from a significant deficit.16 Another factor however, working in his favour, is the fact that despite the police seizing his computer and searching it, no doubt, there appears to have been no evidence of him having any other internet relationship with another child. This was, thus, not a man who was trawling the internet for young girls prepared to send him intimate photos of themselves.17 So this case has two significant features which differ from those which appear in the press regularly: they are that the offender was honest with the young girl about his age; and that he was not, as I have said, trawling the internet for similar young girls. However, this is a case where the offender exploited the young girl for his sexual gratification and fails to realise that what he did was seriously wrong. 18 In such circumstances a sentence which would act as a significant personal deterrent is required. The contents of the probation and parole report suggest very much that the offender does not understand or does not believe that what he did was wrong. The attitude of the offender expressed in the probation and parole report is significantly different to the attitude he expressed in evidence to me when this matter was first before the Courts.19 Mr Hogan concedes that a custodial sentence is required, but asked that I impose a suspended sentence. That does have some attractions in that it could act as a deterrent to the offender from committing further offences, knowing that if he does, he will go to full time custody. But I am satisfied that suspension is inappropriate. I am satisfied that the offender needs to be punished for what he has done and that suspending a sentence of imprisonment is insufficient punishment to reflect the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct and to reflect the very great need to personally deter the offender from future offences of this nature.20 The order I make is therefore this. The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of six months to commence today. It will expire on 30 April next year and I set a head sentence of one year and three months. The offender is to be released to parole on 30 April next year.

      30077/07 Safwat ABDEL-HADY v Magistrate FREUND & Anor 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Mr Abdel-Hady was charged with three offences being an act of indecency, and one count of unlawfully causing each alleged victim (two of them) to take a stupefying drug with the intent of committing an indictable offence of indecent assault.  
     
      
    2 The charges came before her Honour Magistrate Freund for committal proceeding, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) seeking to commit Mr Abdel-Hady for trial in the District Court of New South Wales.  
     
      
    3 Criminal procedure in New South Wales now provides for committal proceedings to be dealt with by way of statements unless the accused is successful in an application to the Magistrate’s Court that the persons who had given the statement to the Police, on which statement the Crown is relying, be available for cross-examination. That application is made before the Magistrate and dealt with in accordance with the provisions to which I will come.  
     
      
    4 Application was made by Mr Abdel-Hady to her Honour the learned Magistrate that eight persons attend to give evidence at the committal hearing. Those eight persons included the two alleged victims. Of the other six, the Crown consented to a direction requiring the attendance of two of them. One further witness was required for attendance by the learned Magistrate who declined to make a direction in relation to the remaining three witnesses.  
     
      
    5 Mr Abdel-Hady seeks an order in the nature of mandamus directed to the learned Magistrate and alternatively seeks to appeal the decision of the Magistrate.  
     
      
    6 Preliminary to the order in the nature of mandamus, orders, in the nature of certiorari, quashing the decision of the Magistrate have been sought.  
     
      
    The Proceedings Below 
     
      
    7 Mr Abdel-Hady supported his application for the attendance of witnesses by a document that outlined the areas of cross-examination proposed in relation to each of the witnesses. Further, counsel on behalf of Mr Abdel-Hady filed written submissions in support of the application. Each document is before the Court.  
     
      
    8 The Crown, as stated, consented to a direction that two of the witnesses attend to give evidence at the committal. Her Honour issued directions in accordance with that consent: section 91(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Further the witness Sharon Neville was the subject of a direction, over the opposition of the Crown, that the witness attend for the purpose of cross-examination.  
     
      
    9 Her Honour refused the application for attendance in relation to each of the complainants and the proposed witnesses Leyla Marcos, Shane McNally and Catriona Gilchrist.  
     
      
    10 As is probably obvious from the nature of the charges, the Crown alleges that Mr Abdel-Hady drugged the alleged victims for the purpose of sexual misconduct. The learned Magistrate sets out the basic factual allegations for the purpose of determining the application before her.  
     
      
    11 The alleged victims, each of whom was a partner to the other, attended Barrons Bar in Kings Cross with two other friends. While in the bar they met Mr Abdel-Hady and had drinks with him for a number of hours. At approximately 4am they left the bar and Mr Abdel-Hady suggested that the victims come back to his premises. They accepted that invitation.  
     
      
    12 At the premises it is alleged that Mr Abdel-Hady mixed a drink with drugs and gave the drink to each of the complainants for the purpose of certain sexual misconduct (the details of which are irrelevant for present purposes).  
     
      
    13 Each of the complainants gives a very hazy recollection of some events that each says occurred thereafter. Neither of them had a clear memory of events for a period of some three hours between 7am and 10am on the day in question.  
     
      
    14 Each attended Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and consented to sexual assault examinations and blood tests. The results of the blood test seem to be that each of the alleged victims had ingested zolpidem (a generic name of the drug used in, for example, the sleeping tablet marketed under the brand name Stilnox) and consistent with the ingestion of one to two tablets within the twelve hours prior to the test being conducted.  
     
      
    15 The allegations are that the two victims discussed what had occurred between themselves in the taxi ride from Mr Abdel-Hady’s home to the hospital. Further it is part of the Crown case against Mr Abdel-Hady that one or more of the victims made a complaint as to the sexual misconduct at an early stage, apart from the immediate complaint to the police.  
     
      
    16 Ms Marcos and Mr McNally gave evidence about the conduct of the two victims prior to and at the bar on the night of the alleged offence. Further they give evidence of an alleged conversation that occurred the day after the event in which complaint is made. Ms Marcos (paragraph 20 of her statement) says that she was told “what had happened to them” by her partner Shane and the statement makes a number of references to the expression “they told us” in recounting a later conversation between all four persons. There is also a reference to a summary of the material by using the words “they went into much more detail of what had happened”. Mr McNally made no reference to the discussion with Ms Marcos. He does however refer to a conversation with the female victim on the telephone, recounting some but not all of the conversation and by summarising the conversation in words such as the victim “explained the process they went through”. Ms Marcos referred continually to the plural form in terms of the conversation relating to the complaint and the events that occurred at the premises of Mr Abdel-Hady.  
     
      
    17 The learned Magistrate did not detail all of these facts. That is not a criticism of the Magistrate. The facts of the matter for these purposes was generally the subject of agreement.  
     
      
    18 Her Honour noted the submission on behalf of Mr Abdel-Hady that the witnesses Mr McNally and Ms Marcos were required for cross-examination “in relation to the particularity of complaint made by the complainants to them after the alleged incident and what was said and who said what”. After reciting that summary her Honour concluded in terms that she was “not satisfied that there are substantial reasons why in the interests of justice these witnesses should attend to give oral evidence”.  
     
      
    19 In relation to the witness Ms Gilchrist, the learned Magistrate again noted that Ms Gilchrist gave evidence of complaint. She had received a text message and a telephone call from the female victim when the female victim was at Mr Abdel-Hady’s premises. (There is no issue, it seems, that each of the victims was at the premises of Mr Abdel-Hady.) Again, the learned Magistrate noted that the submissions as to the reasons for Ms Gilchrist’s attendance was for the purpose of cross-examination on the particularity of the complaint made to her and whether there was any issue of contamination of evidence bearing in mind the complainants’ haziness. Once more, the learned Magistrate then stated her conclusion that she was “not satisfied that there are substantial reasons why in the interests of justice this witness should also attend to give oral evidence”. 
     
      
    20 The learned Magistrate then deals with the evidence of the two alleged victims. The learned Magistrate states that the nature of the application was one dealing with whether the complainants should be called pursuant to the terms of “section 93 (sic) of the Criminal Procedure Act.” Noting, once more, that she had read the statements, the learned Magistrate noted that the reason for the proposed cross-examination was to deal with the amount or quantity of alcohol consumed (there being an allegation of a discrepancy as to what they say they drank compared to the level of alcohol in their blood tests and the medical reports); other opportunities for their drinks to be “spiked”; the use of cocaine during their time at Mr Abdel-Hady’s house; and, the issue of contamination of their evidence by the conversations between the complainants and between one or more of the complainants and other parties.  
     
      
    21 Notwithstanding her Honour’s reference to section 93 of the Criminal Procedure Act, her Honour notes that it is “not a matter that falls within the issue of special circumstances, but in fact substantial circumstances, which means the bar is not as high and the test is not as stringent”. Her Honour concludes, once more, that she was “not satisfied that there are substantial reasons why in the interests of justice they should be called to give evidence.  
     
      
    Jurisdiction of the Court 
     
      
    22 As previously outlined the relief claimed by Mr Abdel-Hady is the quashing of the judgment of the learned magistrate, orders that are in the nature of certiorari, and consequential orders in the nature of mandamus requiring the learned magistrate to give a direction for the attendance of the witnesses.  
     
      
    23 In the alternative, Mr Abdel-Hady seeks leave to appeal the judgment of her Honour under section 53(3) of the Crimes (Local Court Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).  
     
      
    24 The provisions of section 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) generally allow for the issue of the writ of certiorari (or orders in the nature thereof) for any error of law. By virtue of sub-section 69(4), the record, for the purposes of the issue of any such relief, includes the reasons for judgment. There is a long line of authority which confines to jurisdictional error the basis of certiorari against the Magistrate’s Court in relation to committal proceedings. While some doubt has been expressed about the correctness of that line of authority (see Mason J in Sankey v Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 83-84), it is inappropriate for me to do other than apply that authority.  
     
      
    25 However, notwithstanding the unavailability of certiorari in relation to those magistrates who have committed a person for trial, mandamus is nevertheless available. It is, however, available only in circumstances where the purported exercise of jurisdiction is nugatory and void so that there has not been an ostensible exercise of the jurisdiction conferred: see Waterhouse v Gilmore (1988) 12 NSWLR 270 at 275-276.  
     
      
    26 It is unnecessary for me to decide whether a distinction may be drawn as to the availability of certiorari for error of law between the decision to commit (or the decision to refuse to commit) and decisions made in the exercise of a jurisdictional power required to be made in the course of the committal proceeding. Similarly, it is unnecessary to determine whether mandamus will issue independently of the decision to commit (or refuse to commit), because a duty is imposed on a magistrate under the provisions of sections 91 and/or 93 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  
     
      
    The Procedure before the Magistrate 
     
      
    27 It is necessary to set out the terms of section 91 and to summarise the relevant provisions of section 93. Before doing so it is desirable to reiterate that the Criminal Procedure Act provides for committal proceedings before the Local Court with respect to indictable offences to be, essentially, conducted “on the papers”. Evidence at a committal is, according to section 74(1) of the aforesaid Act, given by written statements that are admissible as such after they have been served on the accused person (section 75).  
     
      
    28 The terms of the Criminal Procedure Act then give to the magistrate conducting the committal the power to direct the attendance at the committal proceedings of a person who has made a written statement that has been tendered. That direction may be given on the magistrate’s own motion or on the application of either the accused person or the prosecutor. Section 91 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “91(1) The Magistrate may direct the attendance at the committal proceedings of the person who made a written statement that the prosecution intends to tender as evidence in the committal proceedings. The direction may be given on the Magistrate’s own motion or on the application of the accused person or the prosecutor.  
         
        (2) The Magistrate must give the direction if an application is made by the accused person or the prosecutor and the other party consents to the direction being given.  
         
        (3) In any other circumstance, the Magistrate may give a direction only if satisfied that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence.  
         
        (3A) A direction may not be given for the reasons referred to in subsection (3) if the written statement has already been admitted in evidence. This does not prevent a direction being given merely because the written statement is tendered to the Magistrate for the purpose of determining an application for a direction under this section.  
         
        (4) The written statement may be admissible in evidence in the proceedings after the direction is given if:  
         
          
          (a) the accused person and the prosecutor consent to the statement being admitted, or  
           
          (b) the Magistrate is satisfied that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the statement should be admitted.  
          
         
        (5) A direction given on the application of the accused person or the prosecutor may be withdrawn only:  
         
          
          (a) on the application, or with the consent, of the applicant, or  
           
          (b) if the applicant fails to appear, on the application of the other party.  
          
         
        (6) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the determination of substantial reasons under subsections (3) and (4).  
         
        (7) If a person attends to give oral evidence because of a direction under this section, the Magistrate must not allow the person to be cross-examined in respect of matters that were not the basis of the reasons for giving the direction, unless the Magistrate is satisfied that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should be cross-examined in respect of those matters.  
         
        (7A) A direction may not be given under this section so as to require the attendance of the complainant in proceedings for a prescribed sexual offence if the complainant is an intellectually impaired person (within the meaning of Part 6 of Chapter 6).  
         
        (8) A direction may not be given under this section so as to require the attendance of the complainant in proceedings for a child sexual assault offence if the complainant:  
         
          
          (a) was under the age of 16 years:  
           
            
            (i) on the earliest date on which, or  
             
            (ii) at the beginning of the earliest period during which,  
             
            any child sexual assault offence to which the proceedings relate was allegedly committed, and  
            
           
          (b) is currently under the age of 18 years.  
          
         
        (9) For the purposes of subsection (8):  
         
        ""child sexual assault offence"" means:  
         
          
          (a) a prescribed sexual offence, or  
           
          (b) an offence that, at the time it was committed, was a child sexual assault offence for the purposes of subsection (8), or  
           
          (c) an offence of attempting, or of conspiracy or incitement, to commit an offence referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).  
          
         
        
        
        ""complainant"", in relation to any proceedings, means the person, or any of the persons, against whom a prescribed sexual offence with which the accused person stands charged in those proceedings is alleged to have been committed, and includes:  
         
          
          (a) in relation to an offence under section 80E of the  
          Crimes Act 1900  
          , the person who is alleged to have been the subject of sexual servitude, and  
           
          (b) in relation to an offence under section 91D, 91E or 91F of the  
          Crimes Act 1900  
          , the person under the age of 18 years who is alleged to have participated in an act of child prostitution, and  
           
          (c) in relation to an offence under section 91G of the  
          Crimes Act 1900 
          , the person under the age of 18 years who is alleged to have been used for pornographic purposes.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    29 The only restriction on the ability of an accused person to apply to cross-examine any such witness is the requirement to give notice to the prosecution: see section 92 of the Act. Section 93 is a provision dealing with witnesses who are alleged victims of the offence, where the offence is one involving violence. An offence involving violence is defined in the Act and does not include the offences here in question. Further, in circumstances where section 93 of the Act applies, the magistrate can still order attendance of the witness but it requires “special reasons why the alleged victim should, in the interests of justice, attend to give oral evidence”. 
     
      
    30 It is accepted that section 93 does not apply to the exercise undertaken by the learned Magistrate. As her Honour remarked, a section 91 direction requires satisfaction for the exercise of the power at a lower level than it would were the exercise being performed under section 93 of the Act.  
     
      
    Substantial Reasons 
     
      
    31 The comparison between the use of the term “substantial reasons” and “special reasons” is informative. The term “substantial” has been the subject of judicial pronouncement in many contexts. It was the subject of comment by the Court of Appeal in Losurdo v DPP (1998) 44 NSWLR 618 and by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kennedy v R (1997) 94 A Crim R 341.  
     
      
    32 The analysis of the use of the term “substantial” generally commences with the oft cited passage in Tillmanns Butcheries v AMIEU (1979) 42 FLR 331 at 348: 
     
      
       
        
        “The word ‘substantial’ is not only susceptible of ambiguity; it is a word calculated to conceal a lack of precision … [I]t can, in an appropriate context, mean real or of substance as distinct from ephemeral or nominal. It can also mean large, weighty or big. It can be used in the relative sense or can indicate an absolute significance, quantity or size.” 
        
       
      
    33 Usually it has two distinct meanings: either “of substance” or “in substance”. As such it has two quite distinct effects. The first of them is to use the words “substantial” to qualify “existence at all” and is used in contra-distinction to the term “nominal” or “ephemeral” and can often mean “significant” (see for example Tillmanns Butcheries, (supra); O’Brien Glass Industries Limited v Cool and Sons Pty Ltd t/a Wagga Windscreen Service (1983) 77 FLR 441). 
     
      
    34 The second or later use of the term “substantial”, meaning “in substance”, is used to qualify “totality” and is used in the sense of essential, primary examples of which would be “substantial compliance” or “substantially all” (see Bonnard v London General Omnibus (1921) 38 RPC 1; Re: Bonny [1986] 2 Qd.R 80; Re: Migliorini; ex parte Silk Brothers (1974) 22 FLR 491; Marc A Hammond Pty Ltd v Papa Carmine Pty Ltd (1977) 28 FLR 160; Palser v Grinling [1948] A.C. 291; Chatsworth Investments Ltd v Amoco (UK) Ltd [1968] 1 Ch 665; Henry Burford [1932] 2 Ch 122; A.E. Terry’s Motors Ltd v Rinder [1948] SASR 167; Commissioner for Superannuation v Scott (1987) 13 FCR 404). 
     
      
    35 In my view, and in accordance with the meaning given to the term in Kennedy, supra, and Losurdo, the words “substantial” in section 91 of the Act is used to qualify “reasons” in a way which makes clear that it is not “any reasons” but substantial or significant reasons that are required. In that sense the term is used to mean reasons other than reasons which would be described as ephemeral or nominal. In any analysis they are not required to be “special” which generally seems to imply a unique situation or one which pertains only to that individual. “Special” is defined by the Macquarie Dictionary as “relating or peculiar to a particular person, thing, instance; having a particular function, purpose, of a distinct or particular character; being a particular one; extraordinary or exceptional.” However the term “special” is often used in contra-distinction or in conjunction with the word “extraordinary”.  
     
      
    36 In the scheme of this Act, it is clear that “substantial reasons” requires reasons that are more than nominal or ephemeral and bear in mind the purpose of the Act and its promulgation.  
     
      
    37 That purpose is understood from both the legislative history of the provisions and the pronouncements made on their enactment. As Johnson J noted:  
     
      
       
        
        “[51] The provisions now contained in ss.91 and 93  
        Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
         are the statutory successors to provisions enacted initially in this State more than a decade ago. In  
        Kant v Director of Public Prosecutions  
        (1994) 34 NSWLR 216 at 225D-E, Gleeson CJ (Clarke JA agreeing) observed that the general purpose of s.48EA  
        Justices Act 1902 
         (the predecessor to ss.91 and 93) was not in doubt. The second reading speech revealed that the provision involved a restriction on cross-examination of victims so as to shorten the length of committal proceedings and to strike an appropriate balance between the rights of an accused person and the need to reduce the trauma that court proceedings impose on the victims of crime. Gleeson CJ noted the Minister’s statement that the result of the provision was that a victim would not have to suffer the trauma of giving evidence twice unless this is justified.  
        
       
       
       
        
        [52] The nature and operation of the test involving the requirement of  
        “special reasons” 
         in the  
        “interests of justice” 
         has been considered in a number of decisions:  
        B v Gould  
        (1993) 67 A Crim R 297;  
        R v Anderson  
        (Court of Criminal Appeal, 15 February 1994, unreported);  
        O’Hare v Director of Public Prosecutions 
        ;  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Rainibogi 
        ;  
        TS v George 
        ;  
        Tez v Longley  
        (2004) 142 A Crim R 122. The meaning of the term  
        “special reasons”  
        was considered in those cases against the background of the particular factual circumstances of each case. In  
        B v Gould 
        , Studdert J provides examples of circumstances where  
        “special reasons” 
         might be found:  
        
       
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) if material placed before the Magistrate suggests that there is a real possibility that, if the alleged victim is subject to cross-examination, the accused person will not be committed to trial; 
          
         
        
       
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if the alleged victim has given more than one version of an alleged offence and those versions are inconsistent.” ( 
          DPP v O’Conner 
           [2006] NSWSC 458) 
          
         
        
       
      
    38 It is noteworthy in the examples quoted from Studdert J in B v Gould above that the question of more than one version of an alleged offence is sufficient to show “special” reasons when those versions are inconsistent.  
     
      
    Grounds of Appeal 
     
      
    39 It is clear that her Honour understood that the test to be applied was whether there were “substantial reasons” and also that substantial reasons “means that the bar is not as high and the test is not as stringent”. Her Honour however proceeds to state the reasons that the witness is required and then the conclusion that her Honour is “not satisfied that there are substantial reasons”.  
     
      
    40 Where, as her Honour obviously considered in this case, the conclusion is obvious from a recital of the underlying facts, it is unnecessary to state more in the reasoning process. However, the danger in such a course is that others may not think it quite as obvious. In those latter circumstances, there is insufficient reasoning process disclosed to allow the reader of the judgment to determine how the judicial officer came to the view or conclusion stated. That is an issue in these proceedings.  
     
      
    41 Mr Abdel-Hady complains that there are no or little reasons which disclose the process by which her Honour arrived at the conclusion. I agree.  
     
      
    42 In the circumstances of this case, the statements by the witness who heard the complaint may not be as relevant as complaint evidence may sometimes be, especially in sexual offences that have occurred a significant time prior to the laying of charges. In this case complaint was made immediately to the law enforcement agencies and immediate medical tests were undertaken. Therefore the evidence of independent complaint becomes less significant. Nevertheless, it is evidence relied upon by the Crown at the committal and presumably will be relied upon by the Crown at trial.  
     
      
    43 The fundamental difficulties are that the terms of the statements, while currently inadmissible, are also ambiguous. It is unclear which of the two victims said what. These are particulars that a defendant is entitled to know because, amongst other things, it may show intentional or unintentional collusion as to the evidence that may be given and contamination of the evidence from the discussions between the victims and others. Further, the details of what was said by each of the victims is important if it reveals an inconsistency in versions of events given to the police, to independent friends and/or to the Court. Further such evidence may show, in relation to the evidence given in Court, a reconstruction of events (perhaps understandable in the circumstances).  
     
      
    44 If the magistrate committed the accused for trial in the absence of a direction for these witnesses to attend, the necessary result will be that, at trial, there will need to be a Basha inquiry, because the details of the evidence are unknown to the accused. The avoidance of a Basha inquiry must, without more, be a substantial reason in the interests of justice. It is far better for witnesses to attend at a committal hearing and be cross-examined (even in the risk that they will be cross-examined twice) than have a jury stand down for a trial within a trial with the consequent delay and inconvenience that then occurs. That inconvenience, which is to judge, practitioners and jury, is also felt by the witness, who will, in any event be cross-examined twice, and the victims who must wait around. Ultimately the evidence, and details of it, must be known to the accused.  
     
      
    45 It should also be borne in mind that if the evidence of these witnesses is sufficiently compelling, there may be a plea of guilty arising from their testimony.  
     
      
    46 The forgoing analysis relates solely to the witnesses other than the victims. The legislature has, in defined sexual offences, set a relatively high bar for the personal attendance of victims and their cross-examination in committal proceedings. Where no good reason is given for the necessity of victims (in any case) to give evidence more than once, they should not be compelled so to do.  
     
      
    47 In these proceedings, nothing seems to be gained by the attendance and cross-examination of the victims themselves. Of course, the accused or his counsel could cross-examine on credit and perhaps inconsistencies in the evidence. At this stage it is unclear that there are inconsistencies. Further the cross-examination on credit and inconsistencies becomes much more effective at trial than it would be at committal if, as I propose, an order is made for the attendance of other witnesses who may give evidence of versions which are different from the versions already given by the victims. Their recollection is admittedly hazy.  
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    48 Her Honour was dealing with an application under section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act in the context of a committal proceeding and the necessary pressures on magistrates to deal with matters quickly. Her Honour expressed her conclusions and arrived at that which, to her Honour, was an obvious result. The difficulty with that course is that it does not disclose sufficiently a transparent process of reasoning to arrive at the stated conclusion. 
     
      
    49 Further, her Honour does not disclose that her Honour has taken into account the necessary implications at trial of not requiring the witnesses to attend pursuant to section 91. In those circumstances, her Honour has failed to take into account a relevant circumstance and has erred in so doing. Failure to take into account a relevant circumstance is an error of law that strikes at the heart of the process being undertaken.  
     
      
    50 I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. The decision of her Honour Magistrate Freund given on 2 July 2007 in Director of Public Prosecution v Safwat Abdel-Hady declining to direct that the undermentioned witnesses attend to give oral evidence at the hearing of the committal proceedings be quashed. Those undermentioned witnesses are:  
       
       (a) Shane McNally 
       
       (b) Leyla Marcos 
       
      (c) Catriona Gilchrist.  
       
       
      2. An order pursuant to section 69 of the  
      Supreme Court Act 1970  
      (NSW) that the proceedings be remitted to the Local Court to be heard and determined according to law.  
       
       
      3. Any order staying the committal proceedings, until further order of this Court or otherwise, is dissolved.  
       
       
      4. Orders may be entered forthwith.  
       
       
      5. The parties have liberty to apply on the question of costs.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: These two young men stand for sentence for the killing of Dong Jun Kim, himself a young man, at an amusement parlour in Parramatta in the afternoon of 27 July 2005. One of them was under the age of eighteen at the time and, rather than using his name, I shall refer to him as the juvenile offender. He was found guilty of the murder of Mr Kim after a trial. The other offender, John Phillip Siose, was also charged with murder. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and that plea was accepted by the Crown in discharge of the indictment against him.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    2 The deceased was playing an amusement machine at the parlour in the afternoon in question when the two offenders arrived. Both of them were carrying knives. It seems that they thought it was necessary to do so for their own protection because they were afraid of some men who frequented the area, and it is not suggested that they were carrying them for any aggressive purpose. Nevertheless, the foolishness of their being armed in that way is demonstrated by the tragedy which ensued.  
     
      
    3 The offenders did not know the deceased. They were watching him playing a machine when there was an altercation, in the course of which the juvenile offender stabbed him fatally. How that altercation began is far from clear. The only explanation for it is to be found in Mr Siose’s recorded interview with the police. The juvenile offender declined to be interviewed and did not give evidence at his trial. However, relevant parts of Mr Siose’s interview were admitted in evidence against him.  
     
      
    4 Mr Siose said that on several occasions the deceased turned to look at them and said, “What?” It seems that the offenders interpreted this as a gesture of aggression. They both presented their knives, and they said to the deceased words to the effect of, “Have you got a problem?” This led to a fist fight between the deceased and Mr Siose which, according to Mr Siose, the deceased initiated and in which the deceased was getting the better of him. Eyewitness evidence at the juvenile offender’s trial does not disclose who started the fight. Certainly, eyewitnesses saw the two men exchanging blows, but their evidence does not give unqualified support to the proposition that the deceased was getting the upper hand. Indeed, some of the evidence was to the contrary. There was also eyewitness evidence that the deceased struck the juvenile offender, and that he struck the deceased with a plastic chair.  
     
      
    5 I find it unnecessary to resolve the conflicts in the evidence about the fight. I accept that, when the offenders presented their knives, they intended only to scare the deceased. It may be that it was he who threw the first punch but, in my view, little turns on this. It is clear that it was a brief incident. What is important is that, in the course of it, the juvenile offender stabbed the deceased once to the chest, penetrating the left lung and the heart. Among the matters raised at his trial was whether he was acting in self-defence or in defence of Mr Siose, and those issues were left to the jury as a possible basis for outright acquittal or for the alternative verdict of manslaughter. Clearly, the jury resolved those issues against him on both bases.  
     
      
    6 Equally clearly, the stabbing was a spontaneous act of aggression in the heat of the moment. Nevertheless, the jury must have been satisfied that the juvenile offender had the intention to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. For the purpose of sentence, the Crown prosecutor submitted that I should be satisfied of the intent to kill, given the position and obvious force of the wound. However, the spontaneity of the killing is such that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that intent. He will be sentenced upon the basis that he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm.  
     
      
    7 As to Mr Siose, it was agreed between the parties that he was to be sentenced for manslaughter on the basis that he and the juvenile offender assaulted the deceased by displaying their knives, intending to instil fear in him. (Merely to display a knife with that intention is sufficient in law to amount to an assault.) Knowing that the juvenile offender was armed with a knife, Mr Siose contemplated that he might do an unlawful and dangerous act exposing the deceased to an appreciable risk of serious injury, yet he failed to withdraw from the assault.  
     
      
       
      Victim impact statement 
       
      
    8 I received a victim impact statement by the parents of the deceased, which was read at the sentence proceedings by a family friend. The family came to this country from Korea when the deceased was just ten years old. His parents worked hard to provide him with the opportunity of a happy and fulfilled life. As one would expect, his violent, senseless and untimely death has devastated them. The statement expresses eloquently their grief and their loss.  
     
      
    9 I have regard to that statement in accordance with well-established principle. I express my deepest sympathy to them, as I did when the statement was read.  
     
      
       
      Subjective cases 
       
       
      SSA 
       
      
    10 The juvenile offender was seventeen years old at the time of the offence and is now twenty. He was arrested towards midnight on the day of the offence, 27 July 2005, and has been in custody since. He has a brief history of prior offences, dealt with in the Children’s Court, including an entry for being in custody of a knife in a public place. The record is consistent with his background, to which I shall turn in a moment, but it is not significant for the purpose of sentence.  
     
      
    11 That background is sketched in a comprehensive Juvenile Justice report, a psychological report, and a moving and enlightening statement by one of his sisters. He was born in the Philippines, and his family migrated to this country when he was an infant. He has two older sisters and a younger stepbrother. His parents divorced when he was three years old, and his background thereafter was considerably disturbed. There is no need to recite the circumstances, which are to be found in the material to which I have referred. He had been close to his maternal grandmother, and it seems that she had provided a measure of stability in his otherwise troubled upbringing. Sadly, she died in 2004.  
     
      
    12 His situation was complicated by the fact that he suffers from a condition called hypopituitarism, a hormone deficiency which has impeded his growth. The condition was diagnosed when he was four years old, and he has been treated for it over the years, but he remains of unusually short stature. It seems that this led to his being bullied at school. For that reason, and others associated with his upbringing, his educational progress was not satisfactory. There were disciplinary problems and absenteeism, and he left school in the course of year 9.  
     
      
    13 As his sister put it in her statement, he “preferred to surround himself with older and bigger peers” and “had a tendency to be easily influenced”. Mr Siose, whom he had known from high school, appears to have been his closest friend. He told the Juvenile Justice officer who prepared the report that he was “like a brother to him”. From the age of about fourteen he became involved in gangs of youths. As one might expect, he made enemies in that milieu which, no doubt, was an environment conducive to the carrying of knives for personal protection. 
     
      
    14 As one might also expect, that association led him to the use of illicit drugs. He started by using marijuana, and then progressed to methamphetamine and heroin. Through prior contact with the Department of Juvenile Justice, he had made a number of attempts to address his drug abuse, but without success. He admitted having used marijuana and heroin on the day of the offence, although it is not suggested that that had any bearing upon his culpability. After leaving school he had a number of unskilled jobs, but his employment came to be compromised by his escalating drug use. 
     
      
    15 Despite this rather bleak history, a number of members of his family assured Juvenile Justice officers that they had never known him to be violent or aggressive. In her statement his sister made it clear that she recognises the enormity of his crime and the “overwhelming” grief he has caused to the family of the deceased. Nevertheless, since his arrest she and the rest of the family have rallied to his support, and it is clear that he will continue to enjoy that support in the long term.  
     
      
    16 Much has changed during the period of over two years that he has been in custody. To the various officers who have dealt with him he has been respectful and compliant. He has participated in sport and increased his fitness. More significantly, he has furthered his education. He has completed year 10, and is currently studying year 11 subjects with a view to undertaking the Higher School Certificate. The principal of the school within the juvenile correctional centre at which he is being held has attested that his behaviour in class has been commendable and that he “presents as a steady, independent worker”. He has also completed a number of TAFE courses. All this has been achieved notwithstanding his assessment by Dr Lennings, who provided the psychological report, as having “low average to average cognitive abilities”.  
     
      
    17 Also significantly, he has undergone drug and alcohol counselling and has expressed a determination never to “touch hard drugs again”. The author of the Juvenile Justice report recommended, nevertheless, that he “participate in offence focused counselling to address drug and alcohol issues and relapse prevention, anger management and peer refusal skills”.  
     
      
    18 Since being found guilty of murder, he appears to have accepted responsibility for his actions. He expressed remorse to his sister and to an aunt, who also provided a statement. To the author of the Juvenile Justice report he said that he took full responsibility for what had happened, and that he knew that he had taken the life of a man who “had a good life and a good family”. He added, “This is going to stick with me for the rest of my life”. 
     
      
       
      Siose 
       
      
    19 Mr Siose is only a few months older than the juvenile offender. He was eighteen at the time of the offence, and he also is now twenty. Like the juvenile offender, he has a brief criminal history which brought him to the attention of the Department of Juvenile Justice, but it is of no present significance. He was arrested with the juvenile offender late on 27 July 2005, and has been in custody since. However, he was later sentenced to two months imprisonment, commencing on 28 July 2005, for an offence of dishonesty which he had committed in March of that year. For that reason, the sentence I pass will commence on 28 September 2005. 
     
      
    20 His background is to be found in a psychological report. He also was born in the Philippines. He came to this country, with his parents and his younger sister, when he was about seven years old. Like the juvenile offender, his schooling was characterised by disciplinary problems and truancy, and he left in year 9.  
     
      
    21 He confirmed an association with the young offender from his secondary school years. It seems that his poor response to schooling was the result of his mixing with “the wrong crowd”, as he put it to the psychologist, in the Parramatta area. These developments distressed his parents, who appear to have had high expectations of him. They moved to another area of Sydney, where it was hoped that he would sever his connection with his Parramatta associates and enjoy the positive influence of his extended family. He started the School Certificate at a regional TAFE but, after drifting back to his old companions, did not complete it. 
     
      
    22 He explained to the psychologist that he found it difficult to relate to his extended family, who were committed Christians and who tended to preach to him. He said that they made him feel like “the black sheep”, and he felt comfortable with his peers in the Parramatta area, who were not religious and who accepted him for who he was. After personality testing, the psychologist recorded him to be submissive, having “a tendency to be passive in his interactions with others” and a “strong need for support and attention”.  
     
      
    23 This background provides some explanation for his choice of the environment in which he moved at the time of the offence. Fortunately, it did not lead to his abuse of alcohol or drugs to any significant extent. However, it was an environment which could be threatening. He told the psychologist, as he had earlier told the police, that he and the juvenile offender were carrying knives on the day in question because they had been “heavied” by some men who were “bashing Asian guys” and who had assaulted one of his friends. 
     
      
    24 He also has matured during his period in custody. He has pursued his education, reaching a standard equivalent to year 10. He has attended classes regularly and has been described by educational officers as “a very serious student”. He is in a position to commence studying for years 11 and 12. The psychologist assessed his general intelligence as average, and expressed the view that he could undertake vocational training “at a semi-skilled to skilled level”. He hopes eventually to find employment in the computer industry or, perhaps, as an electrical engineer. 
     
      
    25 He is now on good terms with his family, who visit him regularly and are supportive of him. His mother said in evidence that he had expressed to her his remorse for his crime and his determination to achieve a stable and responsible lifestyle. To that end, the psychologist had this to say at the conclusion of her report: 
     
      
       
        
        John still needs to establish his own identity, therefore to become somewhat more assertive, able to voice his opinions and attitudes without fearing disapproval or loss of love from the people he cares about. It is thought he would benefit from counselling while in custody to develop skills in communication and assertiveness and to establish goals for the future. Any further training, in computer skills, specific vocational skills and other work related programs would be of benefit to enable John to have a wider range of employment opportunities. 
        
       
       
      Sentencing 
       
      
    26 Although the juvenile offender does not have the benefit of a plea of guilty, I accept that he now has insight into the gravity of his crime and is remorseful. Mr Siose’s plea of guilty to manslaughter is an appropriate recognition of the measure of his criminal responsibility, and I accept that he also is remorseful. Both offenders appear to have good prospects of rehabilitation, but those prospects would be enhanced by an extended period at liberty in the community under supervision and subject to the continuing sanction of parole.  
     
      
    27 None of this is to deny the seriousness of their crime. Particularly is this so of the juvenile offender, who faces sentence for murder for which a standard non-parole period of twenty years imprisonment is prescribed. That non-parole period is appropriate for an offender who has been found guilty at trial of an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. In that event, a sentencing court should set that non-parole period unless there are reasons for departing from it.  
     
      
    28 The prevalence of young people carrying knives, and the community’s abhorrence of it, hardly need to be emphasised. In the present case, two young men were in company, both armed with knives. The result was the death of another young man, caused by one tragically effective blow. However, the spontaneity of the juvenile offender’s attack and the surrounding circumstances as I have described them persuade me that his crime falls short of the mid-range of objective seriousness. In any event, his age and his subjective case would provide ample reason to depart from the standard non-parole period. Nevertheless, it takes its place in the sentencing process as a reference point or guidepost.  
     
      
    29 The special considerations governing the sentencing of juvenile offenders are well known, and there is no call for extensive reference to the authorities dealing with them. In R v E & B (2006) 164 A Crim R 208, Kirby J referred to a useful extract from a psychological report which had been quoted in a judgment of the New Zealand Court of Appeal. His Honour set out the passage in his own judgment (at [127]): 
     
      
       
        
        It is widely accepted that adolescents do not possess either the same developmental level of cognitive or psychological maturity as adults … Adolescents have difficulty regulating their moods, impulses and behaviours … Immediate and concrete rewards, along with the reward of peer approval, weigh more heavily in their decisions and hence they are less likely than adults to think through the consequences of their actions. Adolescents’ decision-making capacities are immature and their autonomy constrained. Their ability to make good decisions is mitigated by stressful, unstructured settings and the influence of others. They are more vulnerable than adults to the influence of coercive circumstances such as provocation, duress and threat and are more likely to make riskier decisions when in groups. Adolescents’ desire for peer approval, and fear of rejection, affects their choices even without clear coercion … Also, because adolescents are more impulsive than adults, it may take less of a threat to provoke an aggressive response from an adolescent. 
        
       
      
    30 Consistently with that understanding, it is settled law that considerations of retribution and deterrence remain important in sentencing juveniles for serious crimes, but those considerations are tempered by recognition of the offender’s immaturity and by the need to foster his or her rehabilitation: see, for example, R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451. I must approach the sentencing of the juvenile offender guided by those principles. They must also inform the sentencing of Mr Siose. As I have said, he was eighteen at the time of the offence but is only a few months older than his co-offender. 
     
      
    31 Such aggravating or mitigating factors under s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as are applicable are apparent from my reasons, and need not be recited. Clearly, the juvenile offender faces a much heavier sentence than Mr Siose, whose criminality is markedly less serious. I think it most unlikely that either of them would re-offend in this way. Nevertheless, general deterrence must be reflected in the sentences which I pass as this tragedy was the result of the fact, all too common, that they were armed with knives. 
     
      
    32 As I have said, it is in the interest of the community that both of them have the opportunity for an extended period of conditional liberty to foster their rehabilitation. For that reason, I find special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory ratio between sentence and non-parole period. In the case of the juvenile offender, that departure can only be modest because, notwithstanding his youth, his sentence must be lengthy and the non-parole period I set must be sufficient to reflect considerations of retribution and deterrence. I have more flexibility in the case of Mr Siose, who faces a much lower sentence, although his non-parole period also must be sufficient to mark his criminality. 
     
      
    33 Counsel for the juvenile offender provided me with a table of cases, including one decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, involving murder by a young person by the use of a knife. Some were decided before the introduction of standard non-parole periods, and some after it. Senior counsel for Mr Siose provided me with some cases of manslaughter in circumstances somewhat similar to the present case, also including a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. There is no need to set these cases out. Obviously, each of them turned on its own facts. However, in determining how these two offenders should be dealt with, I have had regard to such pattern as emerges from those cases, together with my own understanding of contemporary sentencing standards. 
     
      
    34 I have determined that the appropriate sentence for the juvenile offender is imprisonment for eighteen years with a non-parole period of thirteen years. In my view, it is desirable that he remain in Juvenile Justice detention for as long as possible to continue the progress he has made towards rehabilitation, particularly through his education. I also think that he would be vulnerable in an adult institution because of his youthful appearance and small stature. For those reasons, I am satisfied that there are special circumstances, within the meaning of s19(3)(a) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, justifying his continued detention as a juvenile offender until he turns twenty-one.  
     
      
    35 Mr Siose’s plea of guilty to manslaughter was entered at a late stage of the proceedings, although before his separate trial was due to commence. It was accepted by the Crown following representations made on his behalf to the Director of Public Prosecutions. He is entitled to a discount of sentence for the utilitarian value of that plea, which I would assess at fifteen percent. But for the plea, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment for eight years. The discount produces, in round figures, a term of six years and nine months. I would set a non-parole period of three years and nine months. 
     
      
    36 Accordingly, the formal orders I make are these: 
     
      
       
        
        The juvenile offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of thirteen years, commencing on 27 July 2005 and expiring on 26 July 2018, and a balance of term of five years, commencing on 27 July 2018 and expiring on 26 July 2023. I direct that he serve his sentence as a juvenile offender until he turns twenty-one years of age. 
        
       
       
        
        John Phillip Siose is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of three years and nine months, commencing on 28 September 2005 and expiring on 27 June 2009, and a balance of term of three years, commencing on 28 June 2009 and expiring on 27 June 2012.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: The first to sixth claimants seek leave to appeal against an order for summary judgment made by Rothman J on 19 June 2006 on an application by the New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission) for assets forfeiture orders in respect of property of the first to sixth claimants, which were subject to restraining orders made by Sully J on 19 January 2006. The claimants in these proceedings were the second to seventh defendants in the proceedings below from which leave to appeal is sought with the first defendant being a Victor Warren Ollis (Ollis). The Summons for Leave to Appeal and the appeal have been heard concurrently. 
     
      
    2 The claimants are the same claimants as in CA 40270/06.  
     
      
       
      Commission’s Notice of Motion for summary judgment 
       
      
    3 The Commission’s Notice of Motion for summary judgment sought orders that judgment be given for the Commission on its claim for assets forfeiture orders in respect of the interests of each of the claimants specified in the schedules to the Notice of Motion.  
     
      
       
      The statutory scheme 
       
      
    4 The assets forfeiture orders made by Rothman J were made pursuant to s 22 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act). That section provides, relevantly:  
     
      
       
        
        “22 Making of assets forfeiture order 
         
         
        (1) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for an order forfeiting to, and vesting in, the Crown all or any of the interests in property that are, or are proposed to be, subject to a restraining order when the assets forfeiture order takes effect. 
         
         
        (1A) An application may be made under subsection (1) before or after or at the same time as an application for the relevant restraining order but may not be determined before the restraining order is granted. 
         
         
        (2) The Supreme Court must make an assets forfeiture order if the Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person whose suspected serious crime related activity, or serious crime related activities, formed the basis of the restraining order was, at any time not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the assets forfeiture order, engaged in:  
         
         
          
          (a) a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more. 
          
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (3) A finding of the Court for the purposes of subsection (2) need not be based on a finding as to the commission of a particular offence or a finding as to any particular quantity involved, and can be based:  
         
         
          
          (a) on a finding that some offence or other constituting a serious crime related activity and punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more was committed, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) on a finding that some offence or other constituting a serious crime related activity was committed involving some quantity or other that was an indictable quantity. 
          
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (4) When an assets forfeiture order is made it must be made so as to apply to specified interests in property. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (6) The raising of a doubt as to whether a person engaged in a serious crime related activity or whether a quantity is an indictable quantity is not of itself sufficient to avoid a finding by the Supreme Court under subsection (2). 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (7) The quashing or setting aside of a conviction for a serious crime related activity or illegal activity does not affect the validity of an assets forfeiture order that was made before or after the conviction was quashed or set aside and was based on the activity. 
         
         
        (8) The making of an assets forfeiture order does not prevent the making of a proceeds assessment order under Division 2 which assesses the value of the proceeds of, or is based on, the serious crime related activity or illegal activity on which the assets forfeiture order was based. 
         
         
        (9) Notice of an application under this section is to be given to a person to whom the application relates and the person may appear, and adduce evidence, at the hearing of the application. 
         
         
        (10) The absence of a person entitled to be given notice of an application for an assets forfeiture order does not prevent the Court from making the order.” 
        
       
       
      Should the assets forfeiture orders be set aside? 
       
      
    5 The claimants submitted that the precondition for the making of an assets forfeiture order under s 22(2) of the Act, that the Court must find it more probable than not that the person whose suspected serious crime related activity which formed the basis of the restraining order was engaged in a serious crime related activity at some time during the six years preceding the making of the application for the assets forfeiture order, was not met.  
     
      
    6 The claimants argued that his Honour was in error in concluding that the Commission was entitled to summary judgment on this point relating to the serious crime related activity of Ollis. The claimants’ submissions in support of this proposition are those relied upon by Ollis in CA 40404/06. The claimants state that if Ollis’ appeal is successful, one of the preconditions for making the assets forfeiture orders was absent and therefore the orders should be set aside. The Commission likewise relied upon its arguments in respect of Ollis’ appeal. As Ollis’ appeal has succeeded, it follows that this ground of appeal must succeed.  
     
      
    7 The claimants next submitted that the precondition that the interests in property subject to the assets forfeiture order be subject to a restraining order when the assets forfeiture order takes effect: s 22(1) had not been met. The submission was based on the submissions made in CA 40270/06. The claimants state that if successful in those proceedings, the restraining orders should be set aside and, therefore, one of the preconditions for the making of assets forfeiture orders was absent, resulting in the orders of Rothman J also being set aside. Those orders have not been set aside and, accordingly, this ground may be immediately put to one side.  
     
      
    8 The claimants further submitted that his Honour erred in refusing to adjourn the Commission’s Notice of Motion for summary judgment pending the outcome of the application for leave to appeal and appeal in CA 40270/06. The claimants argued at the hearing of the Notice of Motion that his Honour should not hear the matter on two discretionary grounds. One of those grounds was that the matter should be stayed, as there was on foot an application for leave to appeal against the restraining orders themselves. The claimants state that by rejecting the claimants’ argument and giving summary judgment, his Honour’s discretion miscarried. Having regard to my conclusion that the restraining orders were properly made, this submission is no longer relevant. 
     
      
    9 It emerged in the argument on the appeal that there was also an issue in respect of this application as to whether his Honour erred in making assets forfeiture orders in respect of property described in general terms in schedules 15, 16, 17, 20, 21 and 22, and which were replicated in the schedules to the Notice of Motion. 
     
      
    10 For the reasons which I have given at [100]ff, and in particular at [115]-[124] in CA 40270/06, I am of the opinion that his Honour was, in any event, in error in making assets forfeiture orders in respect of that property.  
     
      
    11 Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted; 
       
       
      2. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      3. Set aside the orders made by Rothman J on 19 June 2006; 
       
       
      4. Dismiss the Notice of Motion for summary judgment; 
       
       
      5. Order that the respondent Commission pay the claimants’/appellants’ costs of the Summons for Leave to Appeal, the appeal and the costs of the hearing of the application for summary judgment.

     Headnote 
     
     
      
     On the application of the New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission), Sully J made ex parte restraining orders pursuant to the  
     Criminal Assets Recovery Act  
     1990 (NSW) (the  
     Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
     ) in respect of the claimants’ property on the basis that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that the property restrained was serious crime derived property. The property subject of the restraining order included land, bank accounts and all interests in property acquired using funds directly or indirectly sourced from a Mr Victor Warren Ollis (Ollis).  
      
     The application to the Supreme Court was supported by an affidavit from the Commission’s Assistant Director, Financial Investigations, deposing that the claimants’ property was derived from the serious crime related activities of Ollis. Ollis was suspected of having engaged in larceny from the Westpac Banking Corporation contrary to s 117 of the  
     Crimes Act  
     1900 (NSW). It was alleged he took advantage of a ‘glitch’ in the Auto Replenishment (ATR) function between his personal and business banking accounts by withdrawing money to which he was not entitled in the amount of approximately $11 million and thereafter provided part of this money to the claimants. 
      
     The claimants appealed from the orders of Sully J alleging, relevantly: that the property was not serious crime derived property in the hands of Ollis; even if the property was serious crime derived property, there was no evidence that there was a reasonable suspicion that it remained serious crime derived property in the claimants’ hands; and that the orders restraining the property were not specific enough so as to comply with the  
     Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
     . 
      
      
     Held per BEAZLEY JA (HODGSON AND TOBIAS JJA agreeing): 
      
      Was the property serious crime derived property? 
       
       
       (1) The evidence indicated that Ollis knew the conditions placed upon the operation of the ATR facility, that there was a ban placed on his personal account responding to this facility and that he decided to take advantage of a glitch in the facility by continuing to withdraw money: [48] 
        
        
       (2) The allegations contained in the affidavit constituted all of the elements of larceny. As a result, there were reasonable grounds upon which one could form a suspicion that Ollis engaged in a serious crime related activity for the purposes of the  
       Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
       : [49] 
        
        Ilich v The Queen  
        (1987) 162 CLR 110; [1987] HCA 1 (cited);  
        Kennison v Daire 
         (1986) 160 CLR 129; [1986] HCA 4 (followed) 
         
        
       
      Did the property remain serious crime derived property in the hands of the claimants? 
       
       
       (3) It is not necessary for the purposes of s 10 of the  
       Criminal Assets Recovery Act  
       that the affidavit filed in support of an application for a restraining order, as well as establishing on reasonable grounds that there is a suspicion that the property sought to be restrained was serious crime derived property, also prove that that property has not ceased to be serious crime derived property in the hands of another person: [54] 
        
        
       (4) There was sufficient evidence to establish that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the property in the hands of the claimants’ was serious crime derived property: [78], [84], [86], [87], [93], [96], [99] 
        
       
      Were the orders restraining the claimants’ property specific enough for the purposes of the  
      Act 
      ? 
       
       
       (5) Whether the orders restrained “a specified class of interests” in property for the purposes s 10 of the  
       Criminal Assets Recovery Act  
       had to be determined having regard to the context and purposes of the  
       Act  
       as a whole: [102], [107] 
        
        
       (6) Where in s 10(2) of the  
       Criminal Assets Recovery Act  
       reference is made both to “specified interests” and “a specified class of interests” in relation to the imposition of a restraining order, the  
       Criminal Assets Recovery Act  
       is intending to cover different matters. A “specified interest” is in narrower terms than “a specified class of interests”: [115]-[116]  
        
        
       (7) The claimants’ property subject to restraint was property sourced from Ollis. That was sufficient identification of a “specified class of interests” in property for the purposes of ordering a restraining order under the  
       Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
       : [130]

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: On 19 January 2006, on the application of the New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission), Sully J made orders, ex parte, pursuant to s 10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act) restraining the disposal of or dealing with the claimants’ property on the basis that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion that the property restrained was “serious crime derived property” within the meaning of that section as defined in s 9 of the Act.  
     
      
    2 The application was supported by the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark, the Assistant Director, Financial Investigations with the Commission dated 19 January 2006 (the affidavit) in which Mr Spark deposed that the property was derived from the suspected serious crime related activities of a Mr Victor Warren Ollis (Ollis). Ollis was suspected of having engaged in larceny from the Westpac Bank contrary to s 117 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Crimes Act) being an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for five years or more. 
     
      
    3 The claimants are Gail Shields (also known as Gail Lye and Gail Ollis) (Shields), who was a business partner of Ollis and was the recipient from Ollis of over $2.95m of the money he obtained from the bank; Aaron Lye, who from his surname is probably a relative of Shields; Christopher Lye, who is Shields’ son; and three companies of which Shields is a director, the secretary and a sole or major shareholder. The orders against the claimants are not based on any allegation that they have engaged in criminal activity, but on the suspicion that they have interests in property that are serious crime derived property. 
     
      
    4 The claimants now seek an order granting leave to appeal from the orders made by Sully J. The Summons for Leave to Appeal and the appeal were heard concurrently.  
     
      
    5 The Summons for Leave to Appeal was filed significantly out of time and the claimants, therefore, sought an extension of time in which to file it. In an affidavit supporting the application for extension of time, Shields blames her former solicitor for not filing the Summons within time. Leaving that aside, however, it is apparent from the Court’s records (both the file in the Court below and the file in the Court of Appeal) that the matter has had a somewhat complicated curial history. The Commission, although formally opposing the grant of an extension of time, did not advance any specific arguments as to why an extension ought not be granted.  
     
      
    6 The orders made by Sully J were serious orders depriving the claimants from dealing with property of substantial value and subsequently formed the basis of orders for forfeiture of that property. For that reason and given the matter has been fully argued without the Commission raising any matter of prejudice should an extension of time be granted, I am of the opinion that an order extending time should be made.  
     
      
    7 The Commission also, initially, opposed the grant of leave to appeal. The Court was informed that the Commission withdrew that opposition. As a result of the seriousness of the consequences of making the orders which are the subject of the appeal, and as there is now no opposition to the grant of leave, leave to appeal should be granted. 
     
      
       
      Issues on the appeal 
       
      
    8 The claimants raised three specific issues on this appeal (the first appeal). First, that the property restrained was not “serious crime derived property” within the meaning of the Act in the hands of Ollis, and therefore it was not serious crime derived property in the claimants’ hands when and if it came to them or to the extent that it may have come to them.  
     
      
    9 Secondly, even if the property was serious crime derived property in the hands of Ollis, there was no evidence before his Honour from which he could have concluded that there was a reasonable suspicion that it remained serious crime derived property in the hands of the claimants.  
     
      
    10 Thirdly, the orders made by Sully J did not specify “an interest in property” within the meaning of s 10 of the Act.  
     
      
       
      History of the proceedings 
       
      
    11 As I have indicated, this matter has had a complicated history. An overview of that history is of some assistance in understanding the nature of the appeals before the Court. Before dealing briefly with that history it should be observed that the first appeal is one of three appeals which have been heard together by the Court. The second appeal (CA 40404/06) has been brought by Ollis from orders made by Rothman J on 7 June 2006. The third appeal (CA 40435/06) has been brought by the claimants against assets forfeiture orders made by Rothman J on 19 June 2006 in SC 10278/06. There were no published reasons for judgment in that matter.  
     
      
    12 Sully J made the restraining orders the subject of the first appeal on 19 January 2006. At the same time that his Honour made those, he also made restraining orders under s 10 of the Act in respect of Ollis’ property.  
     
      
    13 In addition to making restraining orders under s 10, his Honour also made orders under s 12(1) of the Act for the examination on oath of Ollis and each of the persons on this appeal in respect of their personal affairs. In addition, he made orders under s 12(1) for the examination of Shields as well as a Mr Mark Smith in respect of the affairs of the corporate claimants. Mr Smith is no longer a relevant party in any of the proceedings. 
     
      
    14 The Commission also made an application on 19 January 2006 for assets forfeiture orders under s 22 of the Act in respect of the claimants as well as an application under s 27 of that Act seeking an order against Ollis that he pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed as the value of the proceeds derived from his illegal activities. 
     
      
    15 On 2 February 2006, the claimants filed a submitting appearance to that application save as to costs. That submitting appearance does not appear to have been formally withdrawn. However, given that the claimants have subsequently taken an adversarial stance in the proceedings, including by the filing of a Notice of Motion on the same date seeking a variation of the orders made by Sully J, the submitting appearance should be considered as being qualified and in my view, given the subsequent history of the proceedings, should be taken to have been withdrawn. 
     
      
    16 The variation of the orders sought in the Notice of Motion filed on 2 February 2006 was that the restraint on the dealing with property imposed by the orders made by Sully J only remain  
     
      
       
        
        “… pending a hearing as to the existence of a reasonable suspicion within the meaning of s10 as at the date of such hearing that the property [so restrained] is serious crime derived property within the meaning of s 9 of the Act.”  
        
       
      
    17 The Notice of Motion was subsequently varied in terms not relevant to the issues on the appeals.  
     
      
    18 The Commission also filed a Notice of Motion (subsequently amended) seeking orders for the separate determination of the question whether a single judge of the Supreme Court had the power to order that the orders made by Sully J on 19 January 2006 could be varied in the terms sought by the claimants. An order was made removing the Commission’s amended Notice of Motion into the Court of Appeal. 
     
      
    19 The Court of Appeal determined the separate question on 11 April 2006; New South Wales Crime Commission v Ollis (2006) 65 NSWLR 478; [2006] NSWCA 76, answering the question in the negative. Giles JA (Mason P agreeing) held at [34] that the only basis upon which the making of a restraining order could be challenged on appeal was 
     
      
       
        
        “… on the contention that the judge was in error in determining that there were reasonable grounds for the suspicion …” 
        
       
       
      or alternatively, by establishing the basis for the making of an exclusion order under s 25 of the  
      Act 
      . 
       
      
    20 On 28 February 2006, the Commission sought summary judgment on its claim for a Proceeds Assessment Order under s 27 of the Act against Ollis and on 7 June 2006, Rothman J made an order that the Commission have judgment for its claim for an order under s 27 against Ollis for an amount to be assessed by the Court. That order is the subject of the second appeal. 
     
      
    21 The application made by the Commission under s 22 of the Act in respect of the property of the claimants was heard by Rothman J and determined on 19 June 2006, when his Honour made assets forfeiture orders in respect of property of each of the claimants. An appeal from those orders is the subject of the third appeal. 
     
      
    22 The position, therefore, at the commencement of the hearing of these appeals, was that restraining orders had been made under s 10 of the Act in respect of property of Ollis and the claimants. Those orders formed the foundation for assets forfeiture orders made in respect of property of the claimants pursuant to s 22 of the Act. In addition, an order had been made under s 27 against Ollis for the assessment of the amount that he was to pay to the Treasurer as the value of the proceeds derived from his illegal activities. 
     
      
       
      The  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
      : statutory scheme 
       
      
    23 The Act provides for the confiscation of interests in property of a person engaged in serious crime related activities and enables the proceeds of serious crime related activities to be recovered as a debt due to the Crown. A principal object of the Act is to provide for the confiscation of property without requiring a conviction if the Supreme Court finds that a person more probably than not had engaged in serious crime related activities: s 3. Proceedings on an application for a restraining order or a confiscation order are not criminal proceedings: s 5(1); and the rules of evidence applicable to criminal proceedings do not apply to proceedings under the Act: s 5(2)(b). 
     
      
    24 “Serious crime related activity” is a reference to anything done by a person that was at the time a serious criminal offence, whether or not the person has been charged with the offence, or if charged has been tried, or tried and acquitted, or has been convicted, even if the conviction has been quashed or set aside: s 6(1).  
     
      
    25 Section 6(2)(d) provides that a reference to a “serious criminal offence” is a reference to: 
     
      
       
        
        “an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more and involves theft, fraud, obtaining financial benefit from the crime of another, money laundering, extortion, violence, bribery, corruption, harbouring criminals, blackmail, obtaining or offering a secret commission, perverting the course of justice, tax or revenue evasion, illegal gambling, forgery or homicide” 
        
       
      
    26 Section 7 relevantly defines “interest in property” for purposes of the Act as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “(1) In this Act, a reference to an interest of a person in property is a reference to:  
         
         
          
          (a) an interest the person has in real or personal property, or 
          
         
         
        … 
         
         
          
          (c) an interest of the person that is within a class of interests prescribed as interests in property for the purposes of this Act. 
          
         
         
        (2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), a reference in this Act to an interest of a person in property includes a reference to:  
         
         
        (a) the person’s money …” 
        
       
      
    27 Section 9 of the Act provides, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) An interest in property is serious crime derived property if: 
         
         
          
          (a) it is all or part of the proceeds of a serious crime related activity, or  
          
         
         
          
          (b) it is all or part of the proceeds of the disposal of or other dealing in serious crime derived property, or  
          
         
         
          
          (c) it was wholly or partly acquired using serious crime derived property. 
          
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (3) Once an interest in property becomes serious crime derived property it remains serious crime derived property even if the interest is disposed of or otherwise dealt with (including by being used to acquire an interest in property), but this is qualified by subsection (5). 
         
         
        (4) The meaning of  
        illegally acquired property 
         is ascertained by substituting, in subsections (1)–(3),  
        illegally acquired property 
         for  
        serious crime derived property 
         and  
        illegal activity 
         for  
        serious crime related activity 
        . 
         
         
        (5) An interest in property ceases to be serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property:  
         
         
          
          (a) when it is acquired by a person for sufficient consideration without knowing, and in circumstances that would not arouse a reasonable suspicion, that the interest was, at the time of acquisition, serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    28 “Illegal activity” and “illegally acquired property” are defined in s 4 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        illegal activity 
         means:  
         
         
        (a) a serious crime related activity, or 
         
         
        (b) an act or omission that constitutes an offence (including a common law offence) against the laws of New South Wales or the Commonwealth, or 
         
         
        (c) an act or omission that occurs outside New South Wales, is an offence against the law of the place where it occurs and is of a kind that, if it had occurred in New South Wales, would have been an offence referred to in paragraph (b). 
         
         
        illegally acquired property 
         means an interest in property that is illegally acquired property as provided by section 9.” 
        
       
      
    29 Part 2 of the Act provides for the making of restraining orders. A restraining order is defined in s 10 as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) … an order that no person is to dispose of or attempt to dispose of, or to otherwise deal with or attempt to otherwise deal with, an interest in property to which the order applies except in such manner or in such circumstances (if any) as are specified in the order.” 
        
       
      
    30 Pursuant to s 10(2) of the Act, the Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) specified interests, a specified class of interests or all the interests, in property of a person suspected of having engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities, including interests acquired after the making of the order and before the making of an assets forfeiture order affecting the interests that are subject to the restraining order, or 
         
         
        (b) specified interests, or a specified class of interests, in property that are interests of any other person, or 
         
         
        (c) interests referred to in both paragraph (a) and (b).” 
        
       
      
    31 Section 10(3)(b) provides that the Supreme Court must make the order applied for under subs (2) if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that: 
     
      
       
        
        “in the case of an application in respect of any other interest – the authorised officer suspects that the interest is serious crime derived property because of a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities of a person and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based and the Court considers that having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.” 
        
       
      
    32 A person who contravenes a restraining order is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine equivalent to the value of the interest that was dealt with, or attempted to be dealt with, in contravention of such order or by imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years or both. It is not an offence if the person who dealt with or attempted to deal with the property had no notice that the interest was subject to the restraining order and no reason to suspect that it was: s 16. 
     
      
    33 Part 3 of the Act makes provision for the confiscation of assets. Division 1 deals with assets forfeiture orders. Relevantly, s 22 governs the application for and making of assets forfeiture orders. It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for an order forfeiting to, and vesting in, the Crown all or any of the interests in property that are, or are proposed to be, subject to a restraining order when the assets forfeiture order takes effect. 
         
         
        (1A) An application may be made under subsection (1) before or after or at the same time as an application for the relevant restraining order but may not be determined before the restraining order is granted. 
         
         
        (2) The Supreme Court must make an assets forfeiture order if the Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person whose suspected serious crime related activity, or serious crime related activities, formed the basis of the restraining order was, at any time not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the assets forfeiture order, engaged in:  
         
         
          
          (a) a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more. 
          
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (3) A finding of the Court for the purposes of subsection (2) need not be based on a finding as to the commission of a particular offence or a finding as to any particular quantity involved, and can be based:  
         
         
          
          (a) on a finding that some offence or other constituting a serious crime related activity and punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more was committed, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) on a finding that some offence or other constituting a serious crime related activity was committed involving some quantity or other that was an indictable quantity. 
          
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (4) When an assets forfeiture order is made it must be made so as to apply to specified interests in property. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (6) The raising of a doubt as to whether a person engaged in a serious crime related activity or whether a quantity is an indictable quantity is not of itself sufficient to avoid a finding by the Supreme Court under subsection (2).” 
        
       
      
    34 The effect of an assets forfeiture order is to forfeit the interest in property to the Crown: s 23.  
     
      
    35 Section 25(1) provides, relevantly, that if an assets forfeiture order has been made, a person whose interest in property was forfeited by the order may apply to the Supreme Court for an exclusion order, excluding the interest from the operation of the assets forfeiture order. Section 25(1) also extends to an application for an exclusion order where an assets forfeiture order has been applied for but not made. The Supreme Court must not make an exclusion order unless it is proved that it is more probable than not that, relevantly, the interest in property to which the application relates is not illegally acquired property: s 25(2)(b). 
     
      
    36 Division 2 makes provision for proceeds assessment orders. Section 27 provides that the Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for a proceeds assessment order requiring a person to pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by the person from an illegal activity of the person or of another person.  
     
      
    37 Section 27(2) provides that the Supreme Court must make a proceeds assessment order if it finds it to be more probable than not that the person against whom the order is sought was engaged in  
     
      
       
        
        “(b) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more.” 
        
       
       
      Evidence in support of the application for a restraining order under s 10 
       
      
    38 As outlined above, in order to obtain restraining orders pursuant to s 10(2)(b) of the Act there must be an affidavit of an authorised officer deposing to a suspicion that the interest is serious crime derived property because of a serious crime related activity of a person and reasonable grounds for any such suspicion, on a consideration by the Court of the matters contained in the affidavit. 
     
      
    39 Mr Spark deposed that his suspicion that the property in respect of which restraining orders were sought was serious crime derived property was based on: 
     
      
       
      (a) an investigation report prepared by the Westpac Banking Corporation, provided to the Commission pursuant to s 51 of the  
      Act 
      ;  
       
       
      (b) (i) a police event report, alleging that Ollis and Shields had used a credit card of a third party to obtain credit in an amount over $100,000 in circumstances where the third party had only consented to the use of the card for a single transaction of $1,000;  
       
       
        
        (ii) a second police event report relating to the fraudulent taking of money and other goods from a motel which Ollis and Shields managed;  
        
       
       
        
        (iii) an intelligence report which alleged Ollis and Shields had taken out $1m worth of funds from three other motel businesses that they managed and deposited the moneys into an account in the name of Christopher Lye; and 
        
       
       
      (c) Ollis’ conviction in Queensland for theft and fraud and a further conviction under the  
      Corporations Act 
       2001 (Cth). 
       
      
    40 The principal focus of the claimants’ argument on the appeal was on the contents of the Westpac investigation report. That report stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Westpac Banking Corporation (the Bank) is conducting an investigation, and alleges that Victor Warren OLLIS (Ollis) knowingly and deliberately defrauded the Bank. The Bank alleges Ollis’ conduct has now caused a loss to the Bank in the excess of $11,000.000.00.

        The alleged fraudulent activity was perpetrated as follows 
         
         
        On 21 August 2003 Ollis set up Auto Replenishment (ATR) functionality between his personal account (no 7. above) and company account (no. 1. above). What this entails is at the close of business each day any drawings that have been made from the business account is automatically replenished from funds held in his personal account to bring business account to a nil balance at the close of each business day. 
         
         
        On 17 February 2004 Ollis drew a cheque on his business account in the amount of $37,500.00. Despite there not being sufficient funds held in the personal account of Ollis the auto replenishment took place leaving a debt in the personal account in the amount of $36,536.29. In March 2004 the personal account came to the attention of the Bank’s ‘collections’ area and a status was placed on the account preventing any further drawings from that account. Ollis obviously discovered that despite this status being on the account he could write cheques from the business account and the replenishment would still take place. 
         
         
        Since 17 February 2004 that personal account has been continually overdrawn by no less than $24,000.00. Ollis has made some payments to a Collection House since January 2005 and was clearly aware of the amounts by which the No. 7 account was overdrawn. 
         
         
        At this time we have determined that since 19 August 2005 and from a zero (replenished) balance, 33 cheque drawings in the total amount of $10,480,000.00 have been made from the No. 1 account. Other than the daily replenishment by authority credits to the No. 1 account during that same period amount to only $4,660.00. There have also been a number of further drawings on the account during that period in the total amount of $387,663.32. The destinations of those funds are yet to be determined.  
         
         
        In respect of that $10,480,000.00 the Bank has identified the destinations of funds: 
         
        
       
      
    · 14 cheques in the total amount of $4,780,000.00 deposited directly into accounts conducted by Ollis with the Bendigo Bank.· 19 cheques in the total amount of $5,700,000.00 deposited directly in Ollis’ No. 4 Westpac account then:o Electronic transfers in the total amount of $4,445,000.00 to accounts conducted by Ollis with the Bendigo Bank.o Electronic transfers in the total amount of $396,945.00 to accounts conducted by Gail Shields (his partner) with Westpac. We are in the process of tracing the destination of the subsequent removal of those funds from the Westpac account. o Electronic transfers in the total amount of $60,000.00 to accounts conducted by G Shields with the Bendigo Bank. 
     
      
       
        
         
        … 
         
         
        Credits to the No. 1 account between 17 June 2005 and 19 August 2005 amount to only $4,420.00. 
         
         
        On Tuesday 17 January 2006, Mr Ollis and his legal representative met with a number of Bank representatives. During that meeting Mr Ollis, among other things, indicated: 
         
        
       
      
    · He became aware of a ‘computer glitch’ after discovering that the $37,500.00 cheque had not been dishonoured.· He had taken advantage of that ‘computer glitch’ to utilise funds from his account. · He does not believe he has committed fraud and has legal advice that had his intentions been different he would be in trouble.· He utilised $8M of those funds to:o Pay off his own loans in the amount of $2.5M.o Lend $2.5M to Gail Shields. $1M to purchase property at Parkes and a further $1.5M for future development of that land.o Lend $3M to Mark Smith to purchase 3000 acres for the purpose of the Parkes Airport redevelopment.o Purchase a business ‘Styrocon’ for the amount of $500,000.00.· He holds mortgages of $5.5M in respect of the funds to Shields and Smith.· He was unable to account for the remaining funds at that time but in future will be able to identify, in writing, the source of all funds with the exception of about $200,000.00.· His conditional preparedness to return the subject funds to the Bank in a plan that involved future development of the properties held by Shields and Smith – 12 months or more. 
     
      
       
        
         
        … We understand that both [Ollis and Shields] have an interest in a number of properties and we believe that some have probably been purchased with the proceeds of this alleged fraud particularly given that a recent transfer to the account of [Shields] has been utilised to fund such a purchase.” 
        
       
       
      First issue on the appeal: Did Ollis’ conduct amount to larceny? 
       
      
    41 The claimants submitted that although there was an affidavit of an authorised officer stating a suspicion that the interests of the claimants in the property sought to be restrained were serious crime derived property and specifying the grounds for that suspicion, those grounds were incapable of being rationally regarded as reasonable grounds for the suspicion. It followed that his Honour was in error in making restraining orders against the claimants’ property interests. The essence of this submission was that Ollis’ operations on his accounts as outlined in the Westpac investigation report could not, as a matter of law, amount to larceny and did not constitute any other serious criminal offence for the purposes of the Act.  
     
      
    42 On the appeal, the Commission submitted that alternatively, an offence under s 178A of the Crimes Act had been committed. Section 178A is the offence of fraudulent misappropriation of money. It was common ground that both the offences of larceny and misappropriation of money are offences which fall within the terms of s 6(2)(d) of the Act and are thus serious criminal offences for the purposes of the Act. 
     
      
    43 The claimants contended that as a matter of law, the conduct of Ollis could not amount to larceny, because it could not be established that the owner of the money had not consented to its taking. They argued that because of the operation of the ATR, the bank must be taken to have consented to the transfer of property and if the consent was given in error, consequent on the failure of some internal system of the bank, the mistake involved was not of the fundamental kind required to complete the offence of larceny, that is, as to the identity of the transferee or the nature of what is being transferred or the amount that was being transferred: see Ilich v The Queen (1987) 162 CLR 110; [1987] HCA 1 per Wilson and Dawson JJ at 126 [20].  
     
      
    44 Whilst the principle stated in Ilich is undoubted, I consider that little time needs to be given to the claimants' submission on this point. In Kennison v Daire (1986) 160 CLR 129; [1986] HCA 4 the Court dealt with a situation very similar to that which applies here. In that case, the appellant was convicted of larceny. He had been the holder of an EasyBank card which enabled him to access an automatic teller machine. It was a condition of the use of the card that the customer’s account could only be drawn against to the extent that there were funds available in the account. Prior to the date of the alleged offence, the appellant had withdrawn the total balance in the account and closed the account.  
     
      
    45 The appellant had, however, retained his EasyBank card and used it to withdraw $200. He was able to do so because the bank’s automatic teller machine was offline and remained programmed to facilitate withdrawals of up to $200 by any person who used the machine by inserting a card and entering their personal identification number relevant to that card. Whenever the machine was offline, it was incapable of determining whether the cardholder had any funds in the account or whether the account was current. 
     
      
    46 The appellant submitted that, although he had acted fraudulently with intent permanently to deprive the bank of the sum of $200, the bank at all times intended that the ATM would operate within the terms of its program and that when it did so it gave effect to the intention of the bank. The appellant contended it followed that as the bank intended to give him the money, it consented to the taking, so that there was no larceny. 
     
      
    47 The Court, after referring to the “interesting argument” advanced on behalf of the appellant, stated at 132 [4]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… The fact that the Bank programmed the machine in a way that facilitated the commission of a fraud by a person holding a card did not mean that the Bank consented to the withdrawal of money by a person who had no account with the Bank. It is not suggested that any person, having the authority of the Bank to consent to the particular transaction, did so. The machine could not give the Bank's consent in fact and there is no principle of law that requires it to be treated as though it were a person with authority to decide and consent. The proper inference to be drawn from the facts is that the Bank consented to the withdrawal of up to $200 by a card-holder who presented his card and supplied his personal identification number, only if the card-holder had an account which was current. It would be quite unreal to infer that the Bank consented to the withdrawal by a card-holder whose account had been closed. The conditions of use of the card supplied by the Bank to its customers support the conclusion that no such inference can be drawn.” 
        
       
      
    48 This case is no different. The contents of the Westpac investigation report included information that Ollis knew the conditions of the operation of the ATR facility. He knew the collections area of the bank had placed a ban on his personal account responding to the ATR facility. He also knew that due to a “computer glitch” that ban was not recognised by the ATR facility and he decided to take advantage of that failure and continue to draw on the account in an amount totalling almost $11m.  
     
      
    49 Although the Westpac investigation report indicated that Ollis intended at some stage to repay the funds that he had withdrawn, he did not intend to repay the moneys that he withdrew on each occasion. Rather, he intended to repay other moneys so as to replenish his account. In my opinion, all the elements to constitute the offence of larceny have been alleged in one form or another in its report. The material, therefore, provided a sufficient basis upon which Mr Spark could form the suspicion to which he deposed in his affidavit. In other words, there were reasonable grounds upon which Mr Spark could form a suspicion that Ollis had engaged in a serious crime related activity or activities as required by s 10 of the Act. 
     
      
       
      Second issue on the appeal: Did the property remain serious crime derived property in the hands of the claimants? 
       
      
    50 Counsel for the claimants submitted that there was nothing in Mr Spark’s affidavit that would constitute reasonable grounds for suspicion that the property to which the orders were directed was serious crime derived property in the hands of the claimants, even if there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that that may have been the case in respect of the orders made in respect of Ollis’ property.  
     
      
    51 This submission had a number of bases. First, counsel for the claimants submitted that the Commission bore the onus of establishing under both ss 9(1) and (5) that the interest in property is referable to the serious crime related activity and that there is a reasonable suspicion that the interest in property has not ceased to become serious crime derived property.  
     
      
    52 The Commission accepted that it bore the onus under s 9(1), but contested that it did not carry an onus in relation to s 9(5). Senior counsel for the Commission pointed out that s 9(5) may not even arise on an application for a restraining order. In this case, the Commission submitted that if it arose, it did not do so with such force as to displace Mr Spark’s suspicion, because there was no basis for concluding that the property was acquired for sufficient consideration.  
     
      
    53 I am of the opinion that the claimants’ argument in respect of s 9(5) is misplaced. The Court may only make a restraining order in respect of property that is suspected on reasonable grounds to be serious crime derived property. Section 9 specifies what is “serious crime derived property”. If the material before the Court is not sufficient to establish the relevant suspicion on reasonable grounds, an order under s 10 cannot be made. Such a suspicion would not be excluded unless the evidence disclosed that the property was acquired for sufficient consideration without knowing, and in circumstances that would not arouse a reasonable suspicion, that the interest was at the time of acquisition, serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property. Pursuant to the provisions of s 9(5), such property would have ceased to be serious crime derived property.  
     
      
    54 In my opinion, it is not necessary for the purposes of s 10 that the affidavit filed in support of an application for a restraining order, as well as establishing on reasonable grounds that there is a suspicion that the property sought to be restrained is serious crime derived property, also prove that that property has not ceased to be serious crime derived property. There is nothing in the section which imposes that obligation.  
     
      
    55 Should the Commission be in the possession of such information, it would be under an obligation to disclose it to the court at the time that it made the application under s 10. However, that is quite different from stating that there is an initial onus on the Commission to establish that property has not ceased to be serious crime derived property.  
     
      
    56 It is also relevant to observe that the provisions of s 9 are not only relevant to the operation of s 10, but are also relevant to an application under s 25 for an exclusion order. If property had ceased to be serious crime derived property, that property could be made the subject of an exclusion order under that section. 
     
      
    57 Counsel for the claimants also relied upon the information contained in the Westpac investigation report to the effect that Ollis had loaned money not only to Shields but also to Mr Smith. It was submitted that it should be inferred that as no restraining order had been sought against the property of Mr Smith, there was no reasonable basis for a suspicion that the moneys so loaned or property acquired by utilising the loan moneys, was serious crime derived property. It was then submitted that a similar inference should be drawn in respect of Shields.  
     
      
    58 With respect, this argument involves a non-sequitur. It may be that restraining orders were not made in respect of the property of Mr Smith because the Commission did not have a reasonable basis for a suspicion that in his hands moneys loaned to him by Ollis, or property acquired from such loan, was serious crime derived property. It may also be that the Commission had not at that time moved to apply for a restraining order against Mr Smith. It may be that its investigations were continuing. 
     
      
    59 Counsel for the claimants next submitted in relation to Shields that none of the information contained in Mr Spark’s affidavit supported a reasonable suspicion that the property sought to be restrained was serious crime derived property in her hands. This submission involves a more detailed consideration of both the affidavit and the property restrained. 
     
      
    60 By order 2 made by Sully J on 19 January 2006, his Honour restrained dealing with property described in schedules 6-15 to the order. The property to which the present submission was directed was the property contained in schedules 6-11.  
     
      
    61 In his affidavit, Mr Spark set out the evidence that established that Shields was the registered owner of the property specified in each schedule; the date of acquisition; particulars of the vendors; the consideration paid; the history and present status of any encumbrance on the property. He stated that he suspected that the property specified in the schedules was serious crime derived property because of the serious crime related activity or activities of Ollis. The basis upon which that suspicion was based were the matters referred to in para 4 of his affidavit, including the Westpac investigation report (see [40] above), the facts relating to the ownership of the property and a history of allegations of fraud which had either been the subject of a complaint to police or subject of a criminal charge. Mr Spark revealed in his affidavit that no evidence had been offered when that matter was before the court. It should also be observed that the complaints to the police alleging fraud had been made in 1999 and 2000 and were unconnected with any of the transactions whereby Shields acquired the property subject of the restraining orders.  
     
      
    62 Counsel for the claimants submitted that the history of the allegations of fraud was irrelevant to the question whether there was a reasonable basis for the suspicion that the property was serious crime derived property. He submitted that an examination of the transactional history of the acquisition of the properties demonstrated that the acquisitions were regular on their face. The properties had been acquired for consideration and in some circumstances, were subject to third-party mortgages. Counsel sought to illustrate his point by reference to the property specified in schedules 6, 7, 8 and 11. 
     
      
    63 The property in schedule 6 (comprising six separate lots) had been acquired from Ollis on 6 December 2005 for a consideration of $150,000. Those lots are not subject to any mortgage. That in itself may appear to be regular. However, there are other factors relating to the relationship between Shields and Ollis which may be relevant to the transactional history between the parties and to which I refer below. 
     
      
    64 The property in schedule 7 had been acquired from Ollis on 11 November 2005 for a consideration of $400,000. There is no mortgage registered on the property. Counsel for the claimants submitted that that did not mean that the property was not the subject of a mortgage. It could mean that no mortgage was registered. He pointed out that in the Westpac investigation report Ollis had claimed that he had loaned $2.5m to Shields and that he held mortgages in respect of those funds. No other submission was advanced on behalf of Shields in respect of this property. 
     
      
    65 The property in schedule 8 was transferred from Ross and Suzanne Smith for a consideration of $385,000 on 3 August 2005. Prior to that, on 16 February 2005, Ollis had registered a caveat on the property. On the date of transfer, a mortgage was registered on the property securing an amount of $288,000, with a term of one month and with a minimum interest rate of 48 per cent. That mortgage was discharged on 5 October 2005 and a mortgage from Liberty Funding Pty Ltd was registered, securing an amount of $308,000. 
     
      
    66 Counsel for the claimants submitted that this transactional history indicated that Shields was financing this purchase from sources other than Ollis. An immediate response to this is that there was a difference of almost $100,000 between the purchase price and the mortgage amount. There is also the admitted lending by Ollis to Shields. I deal with this further below. 
     
      
    67 The property in schedule 11 was acquired by Shields on 11 November 2005 from MCA Properties Pty Limited and Gizmo Properties Pty Limited for a consideration of $940,000. There is no mortgage on that property. Counsel for the claimants submitted that there was no evidence to indicate that Ollis was in any way connected with this property or with its purchase. 
     
      
    68 It may be that the transactional history, taken on its own, may not have been sufficient to establish, for the purposes of s 10, that the interests in the property of Shields that were made subject of the restraining orders, was serious crime derived property. However, that was not the only evidence. 
     
      
    69 It was apparent from Mr Spark’s affidavit that Ollis and Shields were in both a personal and business relationship, and had been for many years. In 1985, Ollis had been sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for theft and fraud. In 2000, a number of allegations of fraudulent conduct had been made to the police against Shields. The amounts involved were relatively small, from which a reasonable suspicion could be formed that Shields did not have substantial funds at her disposal at that time. In addition, there had been allegations of fraudulent activity by both Ollis and Shields together.  
     
      
    70 Westpac had, as at the date of the investigation report, traced payments of approximately $460,000 from Ollis’ accounts to Shields’ accounts. 
     
      
    71 Ollis had admitted to Westpac that he had lent $2.5m to Shields, $1m to purchase property and a further $1.5m for future development of that land. The Westpac investigation report does not specify the land to which reference was being made. However, it would seem that it was most likely the land specified in schedule 11.  
     
      
    72 The Westpac investigation report indicated that at least one of the properties had been purchased with funds transferred to Shields’ account from Ollis, the moneys in Ollis’ account having been acquired through the fraudulent use of the ATR facility. 
     
      
    73 Ollis had indicated to Westpac that he was prepared, subject to developing the properties held by himself and Shields, to repay the money. This in itself indicated that Ollis had an interest in or control over the property registered in Shields’ name. 
     
      
    74 I have already indicated that counsel for the claimants limited his submissions to the properties specified in schedules 6, 7, 8 and 11. The reason for his doing so is, perhaps, transparent. The property specified in schedule 9 was transferred from Ollis to Shields on 27 October 2005 for a consideration of $300,000 and there is no mortgage registered on that property. The properties specified in schedule 10, comprising three separate lots, were transferred from Ollis to Shields for a consideration of $50,000 each on 16 November 2005. There is no mortgage on those properties. Shields acquired the property specified in schedule 12 on 12 January 2006 from third parties for a consideration of $450,000. Ollis previously had a caveat over that property which he withdrew on the date of the transfer to Shields. There is no mortgage registered on that property.  
     
      
    75 I have earlier referred to the obligation on the Commission, in the making of an application for a restraining order under s 10, to accurately inform the Court of such information as it has in respect of the property that might indicate that the property sought to be restrained was not serious crime derived property. A failure to do so would constitute an abuse of process. There has been no suggestion in this case that there has been an abuse of process, so the Court was not required to confine its consideration to the affidavit material and to determine whether on that material it was satisfied that there was a reasonable suspicion that the property sought to be restrained was serious crime derived property. 
     
      
    76 The state of the evidence before the Court, therefore in relation to the property of Shields was that between August 2005 and January 2006 she acquired property for a total consideration of $2,775,000. The total amount secured by mortgage was initially $288,000, which subsequently increased to $308,000. The net acquisition cost of the properties was thus perilously close to $2,500,000, being in terms of quantum the same amount Ollis admitted he gave to Shields from his activities using the ATR facility. None of those properties are subject to a registered mortgage in favour of Ollis. 
     
      
    77 In addition, there was the evidence of transfers of moneys from Ollis’ bank accounts to Shields’ bank accounts. Ollis and Shields are personal and business partners, from which an inference could be drawn, sufficient for the purposes of there being a reasonable basis for suspicion, that Shields would know the source of the moneys that she received from him, or at least would know that those moneys could not have been honestly arrived. 
     
      
    78 In my opinion, the evidence was sufficient to establish that there were reasonable grounds for Mr Spark to have a suspicion that Shields’ property was serious crime derived property. In reaching this conclusion, I have not given any specific attention to the property specified in schedules 13, 14 and 15. The property specified in schedules 13 and 14 relate to bank accounts. The property specified in schedule 15 was a specification of ‘interests in property’ acquired as a result of using moneys derived from Ollis. No separate submissions were advanced on this issue in respect of these schedules. My reasons generally in respect of this issue are sufficient in these circumstances to also apply to those schedules. 
     
      
       
      Property of Aaron Lye 
       
      
    79 Counsel for the claimants next dealt with the orders made in respect of the property of Aaron Lye as specified in schedules 3, 14 and 16 and in two items in schedule 13. 
     
      
    80 Mr Spark deposed in his affidavit that Aaron Lye was a signatory of the bank accounts specified in items 2 and 3 of schedule 13, and was a signatory of the bank accounts in schedules 3 and 14. The bank accounts specified in schedule 3 are in the name of Ollis. The relevant bank accounts specified in schedule 13 and schedule 14 are all in the name of Shields, either as trustee of the Shields family trust, or on behalf of herself, trading as Fairway Lodge Motel Kempsey and Cash Flow Positive Investments. The interest in property specified in schedule 16 that was sought to be restrained was stated in general terms, being property acquired since 17 June 2005 by Aaron Lye from moneys sourced from Ollis. 
     
      
    81 The basis of Mr Spark’s belief that the property specified in these schedules was serious crime derived property was the information contained in para 4 of his affidavit, including the content of the Westpac investigation report and the fact that Aaron Lye was the signatory to the bank accounts.  
     
      
    82 Counsel for the claimants submitted that there is no reference in para 4 of Mr Spark’s affidavit to Aaron Lye, nor is there any reference to him in the Westpac investigation report. In particular, counsel submitted that there was no evidence showing that money or property flowed from Ollis, or for that matter, Shields, to Aaron Lye. It was submitted, therefore, that there could not have been any reasonable basis for Mr Spark’s suspicion in relation to property of Aaron Lye.  
     
      
    83 However, ‘interest in property’ is defined in s 7(4) of the Act to mean, for the purposes of that section, “a right, power or privilege in connection with the property”: s 7(4)(b). Being the signatory to an account is a right or power or privilege in connection with the property comprising that bank account. The bank accounts in question are those of Ollis and Shields, either personally, or in the capacity to which I have referred.  
     
      
    84 Given the evidence to which I have referred relating to the reasonable basis for the suspicion that property in the name of Shields is serious crime derived property, and as there was no dispute that there was a reasonable basis for suspicion that Ollis had engaged in a serious crime related activity or activities, there was a reasonable basis for the suspicion stated in respect of Aaron Lye, notwithstanding that there was no evidence that money or property had flowed to him. Having regard to the structure of the Act, being a signatory on the accounts, in conjunction with the evidence relating to Ollis and Shields, there was sufficient evidence for the purposes of making a restraining order against him. 
     
      
    85 It would also appear that Aaron Lye is a relative of Shields, although that of itself would not have been sufficient.  
     
      
    86 The property specified in schedule 16 was in general terms. If the Act permits the orders to be made in those terms, then, having regard to the affidavit evidence relating to Ollis, there was a sufficient basis on reasonable grounds for Mr Spark’s suspicion that any such property was serious crime derived property. 
     
      
       
      Property of Christopher Lye 
       
      
    87 The restraining order made in respect of Christopher Lye related to the property specified in schedule 17. That specification was in general terms, namely Christopher Lye's interests in property were restrained to the extent that those interests were acquired from funds sourced from Ollis. Subject to the question whether an order can be made in respect of property specified in those general terms, for the reasons I have given above in respect of schedule 16, there was a sufficient basis for an order to be made in respect of such property.  
     
      
       
      Property of the corporate claimants 
       
      
    88 The corporate claimants subject to the orders of Sully J are Koala Development Pty Ltd, Parkes Airport Business Centre Pty Ltd, and Parkes Airport Construction Pty Ltd.  
     
      
       
      Property of Koala Developments Pty Ltd 
       
      
    89 The order made in respect of Koala Development Pty Ltd related to the property specified in schedules 18, 19 and 20. Schedules 18 and 19 identified the property to be restrained as the funds in specified bank accounts in the company’s name. Schedule 20 was another of the schedules in general terms, namely the company’s interests in property acquired since 17 June 2005 that was acquired from funds sourced from Ollis.  
     
      
    90 Mr Spark’s belief that Koala Development Pty Ltd has interests in property as defined in s 7 of the Act in the property described in schedules 18 to 20 was based upon: information provided to the Commission by Bendigo Bank that an account in the name of Koala Development Pty Ltd as at 18 January 2006 had a balance of $68,855.76; information provided to the Commission by the Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Limited that an account held in the name of Koala Development Pty Ltd, of which Shields was the signatory, had as at 18 January 2006 an account balance of $125,020; a search of the records of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) database that revealed that Koala Development Pty Ltd was incorporated on 17 October 2005 with Shields as sole director, secretary and shareholder of the company. 
     
      
    91 The suspicion that the interests held by Koala Development Pty Ltd are serious crime derived property, as defined by s 9 of the Act, was based upon the serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities of Ollis.  
     
      
    92 The claimants submitted that the paragraphs relied on within the Westpac investigation report relating to Koala Development Pty Ltd (and the other corporate claimants) do not say anything at all about the source of any interests in the property sought to be restrained. It was submitted, therefore, that Mr Spark’s basis for holding his suspicion fell far short of ‘reasonable’ and his Honour was thereby in error in making the restraining orders. 
     
      
    93 In my opinion, subject to the general nature of the specification of property in schedule 20, for the reasons already given in respect of the other claimants, there was a sufficient basis for the making of the restraining order. The company had only been incorporated in 2005, during the period in which Ollis was utilising the ATR facility. Shields was the sole shareholder and only office bearer. There was evidence that Shields, in a personal capacity, was the recipient of moneys from Ollis and that she was Ollis’ business partner. The company had within a short period of time accumulated a credit balance which was not insubstantial in the bank accounts specified in schedules 18 and 19. Those matters were sufficient for there to be reasonable grounds of suspicion that the moneys in those accounts was serious crime derived property. 
     
      
       
      The property of Parkes Airport Business Centre Pty Ltd 
       
      
    94 The order made in respect of Parkes Airport Business Centre Pty Ltd related to the property specified in schedule 21, which identified the property to be restrained in general terms, namely the company’s interests in property acquired since 17 June 2005 that were acquired from funds sourced from Ollis.  
     
      
    95 In his affidavit, Mr Spark deposed that his belief that Parkes Airport Business Centre Pty Ltd has an “interest in property”, within the meaning of the Act, in the property described in schedule 21 of the affidavit, was based on the following matters: the contents of the Westpac investigation report; and a search of ASIC records which revealed that Parkes Airport Business Centre was incorporated on 16 September 2005 with Shields as sole director, secretary and shareholder of the company and that the property in schedule 21 is serious crime derived property, because of the serious crime related activity or activities of Ollis. 
     
      
    96 Subject to the question whether restraining orders can be made in general terms, the reasons given above in respect of Koala Development Pty Ltd as to the nature of the relationship between Shields and Ollis applies in respect of this claimant. 
     
      
       
      Parkes Airport Construction Pty Ltd 
       
      
    97 The order made in respect of Parkes Airport Construction Pty Ltd related to the property specified in schedule 22 which again identified the property to be restrained in general terms, namely the company’s interests in property acquired since 17 June 2005 that were acquired from funds sourced from Ollis.  
     
      
    98 Mr Spark based his belief on the same information as in respect of the previous corporate claimant, namely the Westpac investigation report; a search of ASIC, which in this case revealed that Parkes Airport Construction Pty Ltd was incorporated on 11 November 2005 and since incorporation Shields had been the secretary and one of the directors of the company, as well as holding 90 per cent of the shares. The other director was Mark Smith, who held 100 shares in the company.  
     
      
    99 Subject to the question whether restraining orders can be made in general terms, the reasons given above in respect of Parkes Airport Construction Pty Ltd as to the nature of the relationship between Shields and Ollis applies in respect of this claimant. 
     
      
       
      Were the orders of Sully J specific enough in reference to the property restrained so as to comply with s 10 of the  
      Act 
      ? 
       
      
    100 In the alternative to the above two arguments; that the property in the hands of Ollis was not serious crime derived property and that there was no reasonable suspicion that it remained serious crime derived property in the hands of the claimants, the claimants argue that the orders made by Sully J on 19 January 2006 are not within power and should be set aside in so far as they purport to restrain the interests in property set out in schedules 15, 16, 17, 20, 21 and 22. The schedules are in the same terms save for the name of the person said to have acquired the property. It is helpful at this point to set out the relevant interests in property which the above schedules relate to:  
     
      
       
        
        “All interests in property acquired by … since 17 June 2005 using funds directly or indirectly sourced from: 
         
         
        1. funds drawn from Westpac Banking Corporation account number 032523 180123 held in the name of Victor Warren Ollis [Ollis’ business bank account]; or 
         
         
        2. funds provided by Victor Warren Ollis.” 
        
       
      
    101 The claimants submit that an order restraining dealing with property described in these general terms is not a proper order under s 10 of the Act because it is not a class of interests and does not relate to ‘specified’ interests as required by s 10. In particular, they submitted that the property specified in the schedules was so indefinite that nobody could know what assets fell within their terms. This was relevant because a breach of a restraining order had criminal consequences: see s 16. 
     
      
    102 This submission involves a consideration of the meaning of the phrase “a specified class of interests in property” in s 10(2)(b). That phrase of course has to be considered in context, not only of s 10(2)(b), but of the Act as a whole.  
     
      
    103 As I have already explained, s 10 specifies the interests in property that may be made the subject of a restraining order. An “interest in property” is itself defined in s 7, although it should be said immediately, if the general description of property in these schedules may be made the subject of a restraint, there is no separate argument that such property does not constitute an “interest in property” within the meaning of s 7. 
     
      
    104 Section 10(2) provides that the Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for a restraining order in respect of property, either of the person who is suspected of having engaged in serious crime related activities: para (a); or of any other person: para (b). The property that may be restrained differs as between (a) and (b) in one relevant respect. In the case of the person who is suspected of having engaged in serious crime related activities, an order may be made in respect of “all the interests in property” of that person.  
     
      
    105 That is not the case in respect of orders made under para (b) in respect of the property of any other person. Rather, in a case of such person, the interests which may be restrained are “specified interests” and “a specified class of interests”. Both those categories of property may also be restrained under para (a) in the case of the person who is suspected of having engaged in serious crime related activities. 
     
      
    106 The meaning of “specified interests” in property was not in dispute and the restraining orders sought by the Commission in respect of property the subject of the other schedules, were orders sought in respect of “specified interests”, such as particularised real estate and nominated bank accounts. The question for determination is whether property acquired by a person using funds directly or indirectly sourced from a particular bank account of Ollis, or funds provided by Ollis, falls within the meaning of “a specified class of interests in property”. 
     
      
    107 Other provisions of the Act are relevant to the determination of that question, including the sections that relate to the purposes of the Act and the manner in which the Act operates. 
     
      
    108 First, a restraining order is made ex parte: s 10(2). It is usual that the Commission give an undertaking as to damages at the time that the restraining order is made. The Supreme Court may refuse to make an order if the 
     
      
       
        
        “State refuses or fails to give to the Court such undertakings as the Court considers appropriate with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both in relation to the making an operation of the order”: s 10(6).  
        
       
       
      The Commission, on behalf of the State, may give the undertaking: s 10(7). 
       
      
    109 The restraining order only remains in effect for two working days unless there is pending before the Supreme Court, relevantly, an application for an assets forfeiture order: s 10(9)(a). Pursuant to s 12 the Court may make a variety of orders including, an order varying the interests in property to which the restraining order relates: para (a). An application for an order under subs (1) may be made by, relevantly the Commission, the owner of the property or, with the leave of the Court any other person: s 12(2). Orders may also be made under s 12 for the examination on oath of “the owner of an interest in property that is subject to the restraining order”; s 12(1)(b)(i), or “another person”: s 12(1)(b)(ii).  
     
      
    110 Section 15 provides for the registration of the restraining order if there is any provision which provides for the registration of title to, and interest in or a charge over property of that kind or, for the lodging of a caveat under the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW).  
     
      
    111 Section 16 provides for an offence should a person contravene a restraining order or ancillary order made under s 12. 
     
      
    112 The existence of a restraining order provides one of the foundational bases for making an assets forfeiture order under s 22. Importantly, an assets forfeiture order can only be made in respect of “specified interests in property”: s 22(4).  
     
      
    113 In McGraw-Hinds (Aust) Proprietary Limited v Smith (1979) 144 CLR 633; [1979] HCA 19, Gibbs J at 643 [4] stated  
     
      
       
        
        “The rule that the same words which occur in different parts of a statute have the same meaning is one which ‘must yield to the requirements of the context’:  
        Madras Electric Supply Corporation Ltd v Boarland  
        [1955] AC 667 at 685. It is well recognised that a word may be used in two different senses in the same section of the one Act …” 
        
       
      
    114 Clyne & Anor v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation & Anor (1981) 150 CLR 1 at 10; [1981] HCA 40 [6] reaffirmed the use of this presumption when construing a statute:  
     
      
       
        
        “No doubt there is a presumption that where the same word is used on more than one occasion in a section it is intended to have the same meaning in each case, but this is not a presumption of very much weight; there is no rigid rule; it all depends on the context.” (Citations omitted)

    115 In my opinion, by using the phrase “specified interests in property” in subs (4), the legislature was intending that the operation of s 22 be so confined. Although s 22(1) provides that the Commission may apply for an assets forfeiture order in respect of all or any of the interests in property that are or proposed to be subject of a restraining order, subs (4) then provides a specific direction as to what may be the subject of an assets forfeiture order, which is not only in different terms to subs (1), but is in narrower terms than s 10(2).  
     
      
    116 It follows therefore, that when in s 10(2) reference is made both to “specified interests” or “a specified class of interests” in property, the Act is intended to cover different matters. Thus, when in s 22(4) the legislature provides that when an assets forfeiture order is made, “it must be made so as to apply to specified interests in property”, the court is being directed to make an order in respect of specified interests in property and not in respect of “a specified class of interest in property”.  
     
      
    117 The reason for this is obvious enough. An assets forfeiture order, in order to be effective, is to operate upon specific property. I say “to be effective”, because, pursuant to s 23, the effect of an assets forfeiture order is to forfeit that interest to the Crown, the property vesting in the Public Trustee for that purpose. The court may also make ancillary orders to facilitate the transfer to the Crown of the interests in the property so forfeited: s 23(4). In my opinion, an assets forfeiture order could not operate upon a “specified class of interests in property” because it would not necessarily be apparent as to what was to be forfeited. 
     
      
    118 Although the same may be said in relation to a restraining order the position is different. First, the purpose in making a restraining order and the processes involved in doing so are different. As already explained, a restraining order is made upon an ex parte application and acts as a foundation for the making of an assets forfeiture order. At the time the restraining order is made, the court only has available to it evidence specified by s 10(3) which is based upon the affidavit evidence. The restraining order only remains in place for two working days unless, relevantly, there is an application for an assets forfeiture order pending before the Supreme Court in respect of the interest.  
     
      
    119 It is quite possible that at such an early stage of an investigation, the Commission may not have available to it precise details of property which is serious crime derived property, notwithstanding that there may be reasonable grounds for a suspicion that a person has come into possession of property that is serious crime derived property. An example of this could occur where the Commission had reasonable grounds to suspect that a sum of money had been transferred from the bank account of the person engaged in serious crime related activity to a third party, but did not have precise information as to how the third party held the moneys so transferred. 
     
      
    120 This is not an idle example. In this case, there was information contained in the Westpac investigation report that Ollis had transferred $2.5m of the moneys he had obtained from Westpac to Shields. However, there was no precise evidence as to how those funds were held by Shields. It was known that Shields had acquired significant parcels of land. However, there was no information in Mr Spark’s affidavit as to whether the funds for the acquisition of those properties derived from that $2.5m, notwithstanding that I have indicated above there was a reasonable basis for an inference to that effect. 
     
      
    121 However, there may have been other sources for the funding of those purchases, or alternatively they may not have been funded out of the $2.5m that Ollis had allegedly “loaned” to Shields, but some other portion of the moneys that he had obtained from Westpac. 
     
      
    122 The purpose of the making of a restraining order is to permit the restraint of property of a person received from, or acquired as the result of obtaining funds from a person engaged in serious crime related activities. The procedure can thus be seen as an urgent procedure which favours the making of an order on material which rises no higher than the grounding of a reasonable suspicion. 
     
      
    123 There are then other provisions in the Act which enable enquiries to be made as to a person’s assets. In particular, an order may be made under s 12 for the examination on oath of a person whose interests in property have been restrained or any other person “concerning the affairs of the owner, including the nature and location of any property in which the owner has an interest”: s 12(1)(b).  
     
      
    124 By contrast, an application for an assets forfeiture order is made upon notice to the person to whom the application relates and that person may appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application: s 22(9). The application must also apply to specified interests in property: s 22(4). Accordingly, if the Commission wished to obtain an assets forfeiture order in respect of property which had been restrained in terms of “a specified class of interests in property”, it could only do so if it was in a position to identify for the court, “specified interests” in respect of that property. 
     
      
    125 By the time an application for an assets forfeiture order was made, the Commission could have utilised the procedures for examination for which provision is made in s 12, which would be one likely source of information for the precise specification of interests required for the purposes of s 22(4).  
     
      
    126 That same source of information could be used so as to obtain a variation of the restraining order as permitted by s 12(1)(a). Indeed, it may be that, if a restraining order had been made in respect of a specified class of interests in property, then, if it was intended that an assets forfeiture order was to be made in respect of property comprised in that specified class of interests, an order varying the interests in property so as to identify the specified property would need to be made. However, it is not necessary to decide this point. 
     
      
    127 There is also provision in the Act for the making of exclusion orders as has been discussed at [35] above. 
     
      
    128 Accordingly, the scheme of the Act is to require increasing specificity in relation to the orders that may be made. 
     
      
    129 That then leads to the question whether the form of the orders made in respect of property identified in schedules 15, 16, 17, 20, 21 and 22 is properly described as “a specified class of interest in property” within the meaning of s 10(2).  
     
      
    130 What is sought to be restrained is not ‘the property’ of the person concerned. Rather, what is identified is property which has been sourced from Ollis. In my opinion, that is sufficient identification of “a specified class of interests in property”.  
     
      
    131 Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Extend the time in which to file the Summons for Leave to Appeal to 16 June 2006; 
       
       
      2. Grant leave to appeal; 
       
       
      3. Appeal dismissed; 
       
       
      4. Claimants to pay the opponent’s costs of the Summons for Leave to Appeal and the appeal.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: A judge’s task is to uphold the rule of law without fear or favour. That is a promise that I made at my swearing in. It is an obligation I am required to keep. Nothing I say should be seen as taking one side or the other in respect of the protest that was launched and in which this appellant took part. But there are a number of things that can be noted.2 There is a right of free speech. The exercise of that right may take many lawful forms, such as the march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge for the Stolen Generation, such as march through Sydney streets against the war in Iraq, the march through the Melbourne streets against the war in Vietnam.3 Where the exercise of free speech is unlawful then the Court’s task is to uphold the law, however the individual member may feel about the cause that he or she became involved in. Men such as Mandela and Ghandi have gone to gaol for protesting but they do not deny their protesting was unlawful. It was the price that they were prepared to pay. Sometimes the law is a bad law, such as Apartheid. Nonetheless, a judge is required to uphold the law that parliament passes. 4 The facts in this case are these. At about 8am on Tuesday 4 September 2007 eleven members of a protest group known as the Solar Generation entered the grounds of Port Waratah Coal Services, which is apparently situated in the Carrington area. This service is one of the main suppliers and loaders of coal export within Australia. The export of coal in Australia is one of the major commodities that this country exports. It is usually black or brown coal rather than clean coal. There are a number of people who feel very strongly about the quality and the nature of the coal that is exported. 5 This property where the export coal loader was, is surrounded by a two metre high cyclone fencing with barbwire on top of it. There are a number of train lines running in and around the perimeter of those premises. Entry to the premises is by authorised personnel only via a secured main entry point in Elizabeth Street, Carrington.6 Once the eleven persons entered the secured grounds, they split into groups. They made their way to a number of the coal reclaimers and stackers, it is said, thereby causing closure of the entire coal loading facility for a period of four hours. 7 Due to the actions of those persons, a whole security check of the premises had to be carried out prior to the commencement of any operations causing major disruption and loss of production to the company. 8 Once inside the ground three persons, including this appellant Wenny Theresia, made their way to the number four-coal reclaimer. That reclaimer recovers coal from a stockpile, placing it onto a conveyer belt, which then transports the coal to a required loader. At the reclaimer the three protesters made their way up a number of ladders to the top of the reclaimer.9 At this point, the other two protesters secured themselves to a fixed part of the machine. In so doing, they used a piece of six inch steel pipe, which had been welded at a right angle. Those two persons, not this appellant, used a piece of wire with self-closing clip and once their hands were inside a pipe, they connected the clips. 10 At this point, this appellant was playing a supporting role of spokesman. Once police approached, all three were informed that they were all under arrest for offences; with various legal safeguards in respect of arrested people, it is said, being adhered to. 11 Police thereafter sought to negotiate with the pair to release themselves. They would not do that. Any criminality associated with that conduct couldn’t be sheeted home to this appellant. 12 Police again tried to inform the activists that they had accomplished what they set out to do. The rationale of the police was that the coal loader had been shut down. It would be appreciated if they would release themselves, which they would not do.13 Yet a third time, the two others were asked to release themselves. They did and were escorted by police to a waiting vehicle. All three were conveyed back to Newcastle and were charged. 14 By her plea and by her acceptance of the Crown case, this appellant concedes that her conduct was unlawful. I am satisfied, and as I say it would appear she is satisfied, the law has been broken.15 When sentencing someone for an offence, the Court is punishing not only for the offence but is punishing the offender for it. Each offender standing before a court may have features about his or her background that suggests that a more or less sentencing option is appropriate. The penalty being appealed against here significantly is both the conviction and the fine. 16 This appellant’s background is probably best, in the short course of an appeal such as this, reviewed by a reference that was prepared in circumstances where this appellant was probably leaving Year Twelve in November of 2002. The report is from the Sydney Girls High School, one of the schools regarded as an elite school in New South Wales.17 “Wenny was elected by her peers to be school captain”, says this report. “In this role she demonstrated strong leadership skills and an ability to work independently and to initiate and implement new ideas. Wenny has been a diligent, motivated student, always conscientious and reliable. Her work has been of a high standard and academic attainment most rewarding”. She has always been most punctual. She has made some exemplary academic achievements, was awarded certificates in excellence for achieving equal second place in Year Seven, third place in Year Eight, certificates of merit for PD, Health, PE, Music, Visual Arts, Design and Technology, English, Latin, Visual Arts, Mathematics and History, over a period of three years, some of the certificates repeated. 18 She participated in the Australian Schools Mathematic Competition, National Science competitions, Australian Schools English competitions, AMP Economic competitions gaining high distinctions, distinctions and credits. She was awarded gold medals in 2001 and 2002 National Latin examinations. She achieved bronze and silver awards and currently (that was in 2002), completing the gold award in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme; attended a Uni summit 2001 on politics and power in the Great Southern Land at the University Melbourne; spoke on behalf of her school at the Pan Pacific and South Asian Woman’s Association of Australia in a seminar which was called Showcasing Volunteers; took part in the Mock Trial Program and other programs; contributed to the Senior Wind Ensemble and School Orchestra; was a participant in that school’s music tour of New Zealand; had been a member of the debating team; achieved gold, silver and bronze medallions in the Student Recognition Scheme; had been involved in fundraising activities with selected school charities including Daffodil Day, Legacy, the 40 Hour Famine, White Rose Day, Community Aid Abroad, Red Cross, Amnesty International.19 She has continued her studies and is studying Arts/Law. She recognises that her conduct was unlawful. She that what was motivating her at the time was that it was urgent for her to express her feelings about climate change and how it would affect my future. She now says that she would look more carefully at whether she broke the law when she did.20 There are occasions when protesters would need to break the law it seems to me, if a law is unjust and again, I come back to the Apartheid law, but this does not appear to me to be one of those. 21 Even so, it seems to me that if there is a benefit that can be obtained, and that she is entitled to it, it would be churlish of a court to deny it simply to establish that the Court’s role is to guarantee the rule of law. It seems to me that also involved in guaranteeing the rule of law is applying such benefits as an appellant is entitled to. 22 Section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that without proceeding to a conviction a court may find a person guilty of an offence and may make one of the following orders; an order directing that the relevant charge be dismissed; an order discharging the person on condition that that person enter into a bond for a term not exceeding two years. So far as is relevant, that is all I need to mention there. 23 In deciding whether to make an order referred to in sub-section (1) the Court is to have regard to the following factors: the person’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental conditions. I have reviewed those except of course to point out that her age is twenty-two. She has accomplished much. Her motives in the commission of this offence were pure, it was her method that was wrong.24 The trivial nature of the offence, there is suggestion that this workplace was shutdown for four hours but there is no other evidence of damage and whether there was a capacity to recover from the four hour shutdown has not been explored in evidence by either side. 25 The extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed, I do not see any of them either way, passion for an idea is not an extenuating circumstance; and any other matter that the Court thinks proper. 26 One of the matters that I do think proper is that a young person who perhaps does not understand fully the nature of a conviction and who has as I say, entered into an act for pure motives although it was the wrong act, ought to be offered at least one opportunity to advance the rest of his or her life without a conviction.27 I do not criticise the learned magistrate one iota. In my view, and in fact when I first looked at this matter, I thought the magistrate had treated this appellant respectfully and properly. I still hold that view. But I am allowed to exercise my own discretion differently from the magistrate and it can still be a proper result. 28 In all the circumstances what I propose to do is to find the appellant guilty of the offence, to discharge her without conviction and hopefully the experience will have been something that will add to her judgment in future. Formal orders are: 
     
     The appeal is upheld. 
     The finding of guilt is confirmed. 
     The conviction is set aside. 
    29 She is discharged without conviction.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Dane Clack identifies as an indigenous Australia. He is now twenty-nine years old. He was born and raised in the Newcastle area. For the first eighteen years of his life he managed to stay out of trouble with the law. 2 However, in the eleven years between ages 18 and 29 things have been a disaster for him. Three and four times annually he is before the summary courts for a range of offending, including larceny, carrying cutting weapon, assault police, malicious damage to property, PCA, drive whilst disqualified offences, contravene apprehended domestic violence and, I suspect, others. He has been sentenced to prison many times during these eleven years. He has been on good behaviour bonds on many occasions. His shortest sentence appears to be one of fourteen days; the longest one of twelve months.3 He says that he now realises he has to confront those issues which are causing him to commit crime. I intend to give him an opportunity to do so in what I am hoping is a more structured way than he would normally receive.4 He comes before the Court on an appeal from a six months sentence imposed by the Local Court magistrate. The papers show that he was also intending to appeal against an eighteen-month s 9 good behaviour bond imposed upon him for breach of an earlier bond. That appeal has been withdrawn and, in those circumstances, there is no need for any further order made by me because the order of the magistrate will stand. I give him leave to withdraw.5 The circumstances surrounding the six-month offence commence at 12.15am, and why at that time of the morning is difficult for me to understand. On 11 August 2007 police observed a vehicle travelling along Glebe Road in a southerly direction. They activated their red and blue warning light, stopped the vehicle in Parkway Avenue at Bar Beach and administered a random breath test. The appellant returned a negative test. Police asked to see his licence. He indicated he did not have a licence with him. He was asked whether he had a licence, and he said no. Police conducted a check that revealed he was disqualified until 2022. It also revealed it was the eighth occasion on which he had driven either while he was disqualified or while he was unlicensed. He said to police, when asked, the reason he was driving was he was going back to his parents’ house at Gateshead. 6 He has a partner of some seven years, which would indicate a capacity to have a stable relationship, although it may be some of those AVOs may relate to that relationship. He has a seven-year-old son from that relationship. He also has an older boy aged thirteen from a prior relationship. The mother of that boy is not keen for the youngster to associate with him because of his continuous offending to date. He is having difficulties with his parents for the same reason.7 What was interesting was that when I asked him as to his skills, a man who was relatively depressed and down in presentation, lit up and began to tell me the things that he was good at. Carpentry and joinery, good with making cabinets and demountables, he had skills in electronics and, indeed, had done some TAFE study in terms of electronics. He was doing maintenance, has actual music theory behind him, perhaps not in terms of a formal course but in terms of study and discussion with a guitarist, and has some skills and his own guitar. He is capable of painting; by that I mean painting a house. He is also skilled, he says, as an artist in painting. 8 His childhood, particularly his school childhood, seems to have been traumatic for him. There seemed to me to be numerous issues in his past that may well require counselling, including his schooling and including his impotence and sense of frustration in forming a relationship with his eldest son. 9 He claims an inability to talk to anyone unless he is familiar with the setting. He certainly had little difficulty talking to me in Court, but he says that is because he is used to it. It will remain to be seen whether this is simply a repeat performance of what he has said in Court on past occasions or whether this is a genuine attempt by him to make a new start. 10 He has to date served one month of sentence. What I propose to do is to put him on a s 11 bond and monitor his progress for the next six months. In the event that he demonstrates a capacity to rehabilitate, then I will suspend the sentence that has been imposed upon him. I will have to make some allowance for the time already served, but that can be done. 11 What I propose to do now is to set the terms of s 11 bail. We have sought, as best we can, to reduce those potential areas where he may trip up, but what I will do is grant him bail pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act conditional upon him, firstly, being of good behaviour for the duration of the bond; that means, not driving someone else’s motor vehicle, not driving at all indeed, not abusing drugs. 12 Secondly, he is to enrol or re-enrol in the personal support programme conducted by Wesley Uniting by 4pm Monday. He is to participate in all programmes with a view to advancing his prospects to gaining employment in one of his skill-based areas. The next condition is, in the event that he obtain such employment, he will do all he can to maintain it.13 He will accept supervision of Probation and Parole at Raymond Terrace. To effect that, he will report to Raymond Terrace with a copy of these orders by 4pm Monday. 14 So that is two places you have got to be on Monday, all right? 15 He will comply with all reasonable directions of Probation and Parole, and attend all appointments, counselling, treatment and programme sessions as directed by Probation and Parole. I commend counselling in respect of self-image issues, life skills, parenting, anger management, drugs and alcohol. He is to discuss with Probation and Parole and Wesley Uniting whether he is suitable to re-enrol in electronics at TAFE for 2008. 16 He is to submit to random urine tests no more than four times monthly at the direction of his case manager with Probation and Parole. Any failure to supply urine or dirty urine is deemed breach of the bail and to be reported to me. For the purposes of this condition, a prescribed dose of methadone is not a dirty urine. So you can still stay on your methadone.17 He is to maintain contact at least once fortnightly with Ms Crellin at Justice Health. He is to report to Jenny Willis at 1pm on 16 November at the Raymond Terrace Community Health Centre, and thereafter fortnightly. He is to provide the Probation and Parole Service on or by the 28th day of each month proof of fortnightly counselling with Jenny Willis. 18 You do that by saying to her very early, “Every time I see you you’ve got to write me a letter or on your card, which I will give to Probation and Parole.” That is all that is needed. All right?APPELLANT: Yep.HIS HONOUR: And if you have got a copy of these conditions, you show that one to her and you say, “I need a card.” She will do it. APPELLANT: All right.HIS HONOUR: Coming back to the Jenny Willis thing, such counselling to focus on self-image, life skills and matters contributing to his depressed state. 19 I am no psychologist, but I am pretty sure you are depressed. 20 He is to abstain from consumption of all alcoholic beverages for the duration of the bail. 21 I order a copy of his evidence given this morning. 22 As I said, the bail is a six-month bail. I will want to see him before Christmas, which is 14 December. He will have to come to Parramatta. Because I want to see and I want documents that are showing me the progress that he has made.23 I order a full background presentence report.

     Victor Warren Ollis v New South Wales Crime Commission 
     
     
      
     
     
     Headnote 
     
    Upon application of the New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission), Sully J, pursuant to s 10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Criminal Assets Recovery Act), made an ex parte restraining order in respect of any interest in property of the claimant, Ollis. Subsequently, the Commission applied for an order under s 27 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act for a proceeds assessment order. The Commission sought summary judgment of that application. 
     
      
    The basis for the making of the proceeds assessment order was that Ollis had engaged in a serious crime related activity, namely, perverting the course of justice, within six years before the making of the application, being conduct that constituted an offence under s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Crimes Act). The conduct upon which the Commission relied was the swearing of two false affidavits in the Wollongong Local Court. Ollis falsely stated he could not pay a judgment debt of approximately $40,000 in circumstances where it was established he had sufficient assets to pay. The Commission also alleged that Ollis’ conduct constituted an offence under s 178BB of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    In an examination conducted pursuant to s 12 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act, Ollis stated he did not have any intent to pervert the course of justice or commit perjury. He said he signed the affidavits without reading them but assumed they were correct as his solicitor prepared them. He said he did not know where his solicitor obtained the false financial information. Ollis did not give evidence before Rothman J but the transcript of the s 12 examination was in evidence.  
     
      
    Rothman J gave judgment in which he held the preconditions for the making of a proceeds assessment order were satisfied. His Honour ordered that summary judgment be given for the Commission for an amount to be assessed by the Court. Ollis appealed from the decision of Rothman J. 
     
      
    Held per BEAZLEY JA (HODGSON and TOBIAS JJA agreeing): 
     
      
      Did his Honour wrongly draw a  
      Jones v Dunkel  
      inference from Ollis’ failure to call his solicitor and wrongly reject Ollis’ evidence? 
       
       
      (1) Where summary judgment is sought pursuant to rule 13.1 of the  
      Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 
       2005 (NSW), if it is demonstrated that there is a real question to be tried, the matter is inappropriate for the entry of summary judgment: [31]-[32]

          (NSWCA, 26 August 1998, unreported) (cited) 
          
         
        
       
      (2) 
        
      Whilst his Honour could have been sceptical as to Ollis’ evidence given in the s 12 examination, it was a significant step to make an adverse credit finding on the transcript evidence and then to reach a conclusion by a process of inferential reasoning supported by a  
      Jones v Dunkel 
       inference on such evidence. The fact that his Honour engaged in that process of reasoning indicated he did not deal with the application in accordance with the principles that govern summary disposal of proceedings: [34] 
       
       Jones v Dunkel 
       (1959) 101 CLR 298; [1959] HCA 8 
       
       
      (3) The Commission had not established there was no real issue to be tried and his Honour’s judgment was not in accordance with the principles governing the summary disposal of proceedings: [36] 
       
      
    Held per BEAZLEY JA (TOBIAS JA agreeing): Was Ollis entitled to the benefit of witness immunity? 
     
      
      (4) A witness cannot be put to answer, civilly or criminally, for words spoken whilst giving evidence and to statements made in the ordinary course of proceedings. However, this is qualified by a number of well-established exceptions including perjury, contempt of court, perverting the course of justice and any other clear statutory provision to the contrary: [39]-[48], [55]

      (5) Ollis’ affidavit upon which the Commission relied was clearly within the category of material to which the immunity extended if it was otherwise applicable: [49] 
       
       
      (6) The nature of an application under the  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act  
      demonstrates that the application is not typically a civil suit, nor do such proceedings constitute prosecution for an offence. The intention of the  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act  
      is to operate upon conduct which constitutes a serious criminal offence so as to provide a statutory exception to the immunity. The Act is not concerned with the liability or potential liability of that person for his or her conduct. As a result, Ollis was not entitled to the benefit of the immunity: [58], [66]-[67], [106]-[107], [110] 
       
        
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act  
      1900 (NSW) ss 6(1), 27 
       
      
    Held per HODGSON JA (disagreeing) 
     
      
      (7) Even accepting that Ollis’ conduct included all the elements specified in s 178BB of the  
      Crimes Act 
      , it could not be considered as being an offence that was punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more, because witness immunity meant that it was not punishable at all: [99] 
       
       
      (8) Having regard to the justification for the immunity, the immunity applies to proceedings that, although not civil or criminal, narrowly construed are court proceedings resulting in serious adverse consequence. Proceedings under the  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act  
      would be considered as proceedings for a civil penalty, such as would attract the privilege of self-incrimination: [101] 
       
        
         
          
          Jamieson and Brugmans v R 
           (1993) 177 CLR 574; [1993] HCA 48 (cited) 
           
          
         
        
       
      (9) The legislature has not by express words or by implication disclosed an intention to displace the immunity. As a result, the immunity applies so that it was not available to the Commission to rely on an offence contrary to s 178BB of the  
      Crimes Act  
      for the purposes of obtaining a proceeds assessment order: [102]-[103] 
       
      
    Held per BEAZLEY JA (HODGSON and TOBIAS JJA agreeing): 
     
      
      Could the Commission rely upon the offence of perverting the course of justice?  
       
       
      (10) 
        
      The trial judge observed that most criminal activity will contravene more than one legislative prohibition and relevantly, in a given area, conduct might constitute perjury and also the offence of perverting the course of justice. His Honour’s conclusion on this was correct:

      (11) Section 6(2)(d) of the  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act  
      does not refer to specific offences as such but refers to an offence that involves each of the specified categories of an offence. If perjury was committed in circumstances where the falsehood was told in order to pervert the course of justice, that would satisfy the concept of perverting the course of justice within the meaning of s 6(2)(d): [73]-[74] 
       
       
      (12) Proving that a false statement had been made recklessly does not necessarily establish that the false statement was made with the requisite intent to pervert the course of justice. Ollis’ evidence on this issue raised a question whether he had the requisite intent to pervert the course of justice. That being so, it could not be said there was no real question to be tried and accordingly, the Court should not have entered summary judgment: [77]-[78]

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA:  
     
      
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    2 On 19 January 2006, the Supreme Court, pursuant to s 10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act) made a restraining order against any interest in property (within the meaning of “interest in property” as defined in s 7 of the Act) of the claimant (Ollis) including the interest in property described in Schedules 1-5 to the order.  
     
      
    3 The order was made ex parte by Sully J upon the application of the New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission) and was based upon the evidence contained in the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark, Assistant Director, Financial Investigations with the Commission, in accordance with s 10 of the Act. 
     
      
    4 At the same time, restraining orders were made in respect of certain property of Gail Ann Shields (Shields) and other parties and companies associated with Shields. Shields and those other parties have sought leave to appeal against the restraining orders made in respect of their property: CA 40270/06.  
     
      
    5 Subsequently, the Commission applied to the Court for an order under s 27 of the Act that Ollis be subject to a proceeds assessment order requiring him to pay an amount assessed as the value of the proceeds derived by him from illegal activities. The Commission sought summary judgment of that application. 
     
      
    6 On 18 April 2006, Rothman J gave judgment in which he held the preconditions for the making of a proceeds assessment order had been made out and that he proposed to make the orders sought by the Commission in its Notice of Motion for summary judgment. Subsequently, on 7 June 2006, his Honour made an order pursuant to r 13.1 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (the UCPR) that judgment be given for the Commission on its claim for a proceeds assessment order against Ollis for an amount to be assessed by the Court. 
     
      
    7 The basis for the making of the proceeds assessment order was that Ollis had engaged in serious crime related activity within the six years before the making of the application for the order, being conduct that constituted an offence under s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Crimes Act). Ollis seeks leave to appeal from his Honour’s order. 
     
      
    8 Assets forfeiture orders pursuant to s 22 of the Act have also been made in respect of the property of Shields and the other claimants. Those parties have sought leave to appeal from the making of those orders: CA 40435/06. 
     
      
    9 The three summonses for leave to appeal were heard together on the basis that the summonses for leave to appeal and the appeals be heard concurrently. Accordingly, these reasons should be read in conjunction with any reasons in appeal proceedings CA 40270/06 and CA 40435/06. 
     
      
       
      The statutory scheme 
       
      
    10 The statutory scheme is considered in detail in my reasons in CA 40270/06. Relevant for present purposes are the provisions of s 27 of the Act, which provides for the making of a proceeds assessment order. Such an application is not a criminal proceeding (see s 5).  
     
      
       
        
        “27 Making of proceeds assessment order 
         
         
        (1) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for a proceeds assessment order requiring a person to pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by the person from an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of the person or another person that took place not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order, whether or not any such activity is an activity on which the application is based as required by subsection (2) …  
         
         
        (2) The Supreme Court must make a proceeds assessment order if the Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person against whom the order is sought was, at any time not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order, engaged in:  
         
         
          
          (a) a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more. 
          
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (5) The quashing or setting aside of a conviction for a serious crime related activity does not affect the validity of a proceeds assessment order. 
         
         
        (6) The making of a proceeds assessment order does not prevent the making under Division 1 of an assets forfeiture order based on the serious crime related activity, or on all or any of the serious crime related activities, in relation to which the proceeds assessment order is made. 
         
         
        (7) The amount a person is required to pay under a proceeds assessment order is a debt payable by the person to the Crown on the making of the order and is recoverable as such. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (9) The net amount recovered under a proceeds assessment order is to be paid to the Treasurer and credited to the Proceeds Account. 
         
         
        (10) Notice of an application under this section is to be given to the person against whom the order is sought and any other person required by the regulations to be given notice. 
         
         
        (11) The absence of a person entitled to be given notice of a proceeds assessment order does not prevent the Court from making the order. 
         
         
        (12) The Supreme Court may, when it makes a proceeds assessment order at any later time, make any ancillary orders that the Court considers appropriate.” 
        
       
       
      Reference also needs to be made to ss 28 and 31. Section 28 provides, relevantly: 
       
       
        
        “28 Assessment of proceeds of serious crime related activity 
         
         
        (1) For the purpose of making an assessment under section 27 in relation to the proceeds derived by a person (in this section called  
        the defendant 
        ) from an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of the person or another person the Supreme Court is to have regard to the following matters: 
         
         
        … 
         
         
          
          (d) the value of the defendant’s property before and after the illegal activity or each illegal activity, 
          
         
         
          
          (e) the defendant’s income and expenditure before and after the illegal activity or activities. 
          
         
         
        (2) If evidence is given at the hearing of an application for a proceeds assessment order that the value of the defendant’s property after an illegal activity or illegal activities of the defendant exceeded the value of the defendant’s property before the activity or activities, the Supreme Court is to treat the excess as proceeds derived by the defendant from the activity or activities, except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme Court is satisfied the excess was due to causes unrelated to an illegal activity or activities. 
         
         
        (3) If evidence is given at the hearing of an application for a proceeds assessment order of the amount of the defendant’s expenditure during the period of 6 years before the making of the application for the order, the Supreme Court is to treat any such amount as proceeds derived by the defendant from an illegal activity or activities, except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme Court is satisfied the expenditure was funded from income, or money from other sources, unrelated to an illegal activity or activities.” 
        
       
       
      Section 31(1) provides that all interests of the person against whom the order is made, where the amount assessed remained unpaid, are charged in favour of the Crown to the extent necessary to secure payment of the assessed amount. 
       
       
      Jurisdictional basis for making the s 27 order 
       
      
    11 The conduct upon which the Commission relied as constituting serious crime related activity engaged in not more than six years before the making of the application was the swearing of two false affidavits by Ollis in the Wollongong Local Court on 16 December 2005. 
     
      
    12 Ollis falsely stated in those affidavits that he could not or was not able to raise the amount of a judgment debt in the sum of approximately $40,000, in circumstances where it was established that in the preceding month he had lent $4.5m to one person and a further $3m to another. The other falsity was Ollis’ failure to disclose that at the time of swearing the affidavit, he had a further $7.5m worth of undisclosed assets. The two affidavits were sworn in support of an application made by Ollis in the Local Court to pay a judgment debt of $40,000 by instalments of at least $1,000 per month.  
     
      
    13 The Commission alleged that Ollis’ conduct in swearing the false affidavits constituted an offence under s 178BB of the Crimes Act of: with intent, obtaining a financial advantage by making a statement which the person knows to be false or misleading in a material particular, or which is false or misleading in a material particular and is made with reckless disregard as to whether it is true or false, or misleading. The offence is punishable by a term of imprisonment for five years. 
     
      
    14 Rothman J held that each of the statements was false and was made by Ollis with the intent to obtain a financial advantage for himself, namely, the payment of the judgment debt by instalments. His Honour held that such an offence was an offence involving fraud or dishonesty: see Pollard v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 659 where Abadee J held that an offence under s 178BB of the Crimes Act was an “offence involving fraud or dishonesty” within the meaning of s 227(2)(b) of the Companies (New South Wales) Code.  
     
      
    15 Rothman J, therefore, held that the conditions precedent for the making of an order under s 27 of the Act were made out, subject to the argument raised by Ollis that as the false statements were made by him as a witness in proceedings, he was entitled to the benefit of immunity from prosecution. The submission made to his Honour was that if Ollis could not be found guilty of the offence and thereby not be punished, conduct which otherwise might constitute the ingredients of the offence cannot be the basis of an order under s 27(2). The same argument, in essence, was advanced before this Court.  
     
      
    16 The Commission, alternatively, submitted to Rothman J that Ollis’ conduct in swearing the false affidavits was a serious crime related activity in that it constituted the offence of perverting the course of justice or attempting to do so in contravention of s 319 of the Crimes Act. Section 319 provides that a person who does any act or makes any omission, intending in any way to pervert the course of justice, is liable to imprisonment for 14 years. 
     
      
    17 His Honour at [44] rejected the submission put on behalf of Ollis that his conduct did not constitute a serious crime related activity because he was entitled to immunity. His Honour held that immunity does not apply to the Act. It followed that the preconditions for the making of an order under s 27 of the Act were satisfied. 
     
      
    18 Rothman J also held it had been established on the evidence that it was more probable than not that Ollis had engaged in conduct which was a contravention of s 319 of the Crimes Act, so that the preconditions for the making of an order under s 27 of the Act in reliance on that conduct were also satisfied.  
     
      
    19 I will return to the evidence to which his Honour referred shortly.  
     
      
    20 Ollis had also argued before his Honour that it was not open to the Commission to rely upon the provisions of s 319 of the Crimes Act because Ollis’ conduct in swearing the false affidavits, if proved, constituted the offence of perjury under s 327. Section 327 provides that a person who in, or in connection with, a judicial proceeding, makes a false statement on oath concerning a material matter knowing the statement to be false, or not believing it to be true, is guilty of perjury and liable to imprisonment for 10 years. Rothman J rejected this argument on the basis that the same conduct may constitute different offences.  
     
      
    21 It is relevant to note that the moneys in respect of which the Commission is seeking a proceeds assessment order is not, or at least, is not only, the financial advantage obtained by swearing the false affidavits, but are also the moneys obtained by virtue of the transactions on the Westpac Bank Accounts.  
     
      
       
      Issues on the appeal 
       
      
    22 Ollis contended that Rothman J erred in the following respects. First, that his Honour wrongly drew a Jones v Dunkel inference from the fact that Ollis did not adduce evidence on the motion: see Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298; [1959] HCA 8. It was submitted that such an inference should not have been drawn, because his Honour was dealing with an application for summary judgment and it would not be expected that a respondent to such application would give evidence. Secondly, that his Honour rejected certain evidence of Ollis given before the Registrar on an examination under s 12 of the Act. It was submitted that his Honour should not have done so and that if there were factual issues to be tried, his Honour should not have made an order entering summary judgment for the Commission. Thirdly, that his Honour wrongly held that witness immunity did not apply. Fourthly, his Honour wrongly found that it had been established that Ollis’ conduct constituted the offence of perverting the course of justice contrary to s 319 in circumstances where it had not been established that Ollis had the intention to pervert the course of justice. Fifthly, that the offences of perverting the course of justice and perjury are discrete offences, which cannot be used in the alternative. Finally, it was contended that the form of orders made by the Court failed to specify the illegal activities the proceeds of which were to be assessed, as required by s 28 of the Act. 
     
      
       
      Evidence that Ollis had been engaged in serious crime related activity for the purposes of s 27 
       
      
    23 Before dealing with the issues on the appeal, it is convenient to deal with the evidence upon which the Commission relied to establish that Ollis had been engaged in a serious crime related activity not more than six years before the making of the application. 
     
      
    24 The false statements upon which the Commission relied, were, as I have said, contained in affidavits sworn in support of Ollis’ application in the Local Court for an order that he pay a judgment debt by instalments. (Those affidavits were not before this Court.) The Commission became aware of this matter during the course of Ollis’ examination pursuant to the order under s 12 made by Sully J on 19 January 2006.  
     
      
    25 Ollis did not contend that the contents of the affidavits were true. Rather, he said that in the circumstances in which he signed the affidavits, he did not have any intent to pervert the course of justice or commit perjury. His explanation of the circumstances in which he signed the affidavits was that he had retained a solicitor to act for him on an application to pay the judgment debt by instalments. He said that the instructions to his solicitor were to make an application so as to get as much time as possible to repay the debt. He said they were his standard instructions to his solicitor at that time as he had “a whole heap of matters that were before the courts”.  
     
      
    26 Ollis said he did not know from where the solicitor obtained the information as to his financial circumstances which he conceded were false. He said that he did not provide the false information to the solicitor and the solicitor may have pulled material out of one of his files that was relevant at an earlier point in time. He said the solicitor did not sit down with him and ask him for the information to prepare the affidavits. Notwithstanding that, Ollis said that he signed the affidavits in the belief that his solicitor had prepared them correctly. He said if the solicitor had wanted any further information from him, he could have asked him, as the solicitor’s office was in the building next door to Ollis’ office. Ollis said more than once that he did not read documents but that it was “crap” to say that he had signed the affidavits “willy-nilly” without regard to whether they were accurate. 
     
      
    27 Ollis said he signed the affidavits in circumstances where his solicitor had handed the affidavits to him through the window of the car without reading them. He reiterated that he didn’t “read documents, remember” and denied he had signed the affidavits without any regard as to the truth or falsity of the statements in them. He said that he assumed they were correct, as he had a solicitor to prepare them for him. 
     
      
       
      First and second issues on the appeal:  
       
       
      1. Should the Court have drawn a  
      Jones v Dunkel 
       inference? 
       
      2. Did the Court wrongly reject Ollis’ evidence given in the s 12 examination? 
       
      
    28 Counsel for Ollis submitted that having regard to the nature of the application before Rothman J, namely, an application for summary judgment for orders under s 27(2), the drawing of a Jones v Dunkel inference was contrary to principle, or, alternatively, the trial judge should have warned Ollis as a matter of procedural fairness that the drawing of such an inference was under contemplation, so as to give him the opportunity to call evidence should he see fit to do so. 
     
      
    29 The inference which was drawn by the trial judge of which complaint is made was that the failure to call the solicitor who prepared the affidavits meant that the necessary inference was that the evidence of the solicitor would not have assisted Ollis’ case.  
     
      
    30 The application for summary judgment was made pursuant to UCPR r 13.1. Rule 13.1 provides relevantly that the court may give judgment on a claim or part of a claim if there is evidence of the facts on which the claim, or part thereof, is based, and there is evidence of the plaintiff or some responsible person, that in the belief of that person giving the evidence, the respondent has no defence to the claim or part of the claim. 
     
      
    31 The general principles relating to the summary disposal of proceedings are well-known. The absence of, relevantly, a defence, must be clearly demonstrated: General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) & Ors (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129; [1964] HCA 69 [8]-[10]. If it is demonstrated that there is a real question to be tried, the matter is inappropriate for the entry of summary judgment: Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners (1949) 78 CLR 62; [1949] HCA 1. The tests stated in the authorities as to whether it is appropriate that a case be disposed of by the entry of summary judgment include statements such as that the matter is “so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly succeed”; “manifestly groundless” or “would involve useless expense”: General Steel Industries at 129 [8]. 
     
      
    32 The summary disposal of proceedings or part thereof deprives a party of the right to a contested hearing. For that reason it is said that the requirement for establishing that there is no arguable defence or that a defence is manifestly groundless is demanding: Air Services Australia v Zarb (NSWCA, 26 August 1998, unreported). In Webster & Anor v Lampard (1993) 177 CLR 598; [1993] HCA 57, Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said at 602-603 [5]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the issue before the learned Master on the application for summary judgment was not whether [the plaintiffs] would probably succeed in their action against [the defendant]. It was whether the material before the Master demonstrated that that action should not be permitted to go to trial in the ordinary way because it was apparent that it must fail. The power to order summary judgment must be exercised with ‘exceptional caution’ and ‘should never be exercised unless it is clear that there is no real question to be tried’  
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Nowhere is that need for exceptional caution more important than in a case where the ultimate outcome turns upon the resolution of some disputed issue or issues of fact. In such a case, it is essential that ‘great care … be exercised to ensure that under the guise of achieving expeditious finality a plaintiff is not improperly deprived of his opportunity for the trial of his case by the appointed tribunal’.” (Citations omitted). 
        
       
      
    33 When regard is had to the principles which govern the summary disposal of proceedings, it must be said that the use of that procedure in this case is unusual. At one level, the Commission set itself a more difficult task in having to satisfy the Court that any defence was untenable. The Court never expressly considered whether that was so. Senior counsel for the Commission acknowledged that his Honour’s reasons for judgment do not deal with the matter on that basis and accepted that in order for this application to have been determined on the basis that it was an application for summary judgment, it would be necessary to read his Honour’s conclusion at [46] and [47] as containing a finding, implicitly, that there was no serious question to be tried. 
     
      
    34 The contention that it is necessary to read his Honour’s judgment in that way itself throws up the difficulty of his Honour having made his finding that Ollis had engaged in conduct contrary to s 178BB on the basis of inferential fact finding, supported by a Jones v Dunkel inference and an adverse credit finding in respect of evidence that was given on another occasion. Whilst his Honour could have been sceptical as to Ollis’ explanation of the circumstances in which he signed the affidavits and of his assertion that he did not read them before signing, it seems to me to be a significant step to make an adverse credit finding and to then reach a conclusion by a process of inferential reasoning supported by a Jones v Dunkel inference on such evidence. The fact that his Honour engaged in that process of reasoning indicates that he did not deal with the application in accordance with the principles that govern summary disposal of proceedings. Indeed, it is difficult to see how a Jones v Dunkel inference could ever be appropriately drawn on such an application. 
     
      
    35 Counsel for Ollis further submitted that his Honour, in not warning Ollis that he was considering drawing an inference, failed to afford procedural fairness in circumstances where, the matter being an application for summary judgment, there was no onus on Ollis as the respondent to that application to adduce evidence. Senior counsel for the Commission submitted that a respondent to an application for summary judgment is not precluded from adducing evidence and that a court may need to determine contentious issues of fact in order to determine whether summary judgment ought to be ordered. Having regard to what I have said in relation to his Honour’s reasoning process, it is unnecessary to deal further with this submission. 
     
      
    36 For the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the Commission had not established there was no real issue to be tried and his Honour’s judgment was not in accordance with the principles governing the summary disposal of proceedings. 
     
      
    37 That, of course, is not sufficient of itself for the appeal to succeed. If in fact the evidence before the trial judge was sufficient to establish that Ollis had engaged in a serious crime related activity within the specified period on a basis whereby there was no tenable argument to the contrary, his Honour’s order may be upheld. 
     
      
       
      Third issue: witness immunity 
       
      
    38 Ollis contended before the trial judge that the evidence upon which the Commission relied could not be used for the purposes of s 27 to establish that he had engaged in a serious crime related activity, because he was entitled to the benefit of the principle of immunity from criminal prosecution in respect of statements made in the ordinary course of a judicial proceeding.  
     
      
    39 The principle of immunity from prosecution was explained by Lord Mansfield in R v Skinner (1772) Lofft 54 at 56; (1772) 98 ER 529 at 530 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… neither party, witness, counsel, the jury, or Judge can be put to answer, civilly or criminally, for words spoken in office.” 
        
       
      
    40 In Hargreaves v Bretherton [1959] 1 QB 45 at 51 Goddard LCJ, after referring to Lord Mansfield's statement said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … that is a perfectly clear statement … that for words spoken by a witness ‘in the office’ which means, of course, for this purpose in giving evidence, he cannot be put to answer either civilly or criminally.” 
        
       
      
    41 An explanation of the underlying basis for the principle is to be found in Cabassi v Vila (1940) 64 CLR 130; [1940] HCA 41. In that case, the appellant had brought proceedings against a Mr Ferrando alleging assault. The proceedings were defended and Ferrando called a number of witnesses to explain the circumstances of the appellant having received the injuries of which she complained. The proceedings were dismissed. Subsequently, the appellant brought a civil action against Ferrando and the witnesses claiming they had conspired together for the purposes of “injuring” her by the giving of false evidence. 
     
      
    42 Rich ACJ explained at 139 that  
     
      
       
        
        “Public policy and the safe administration of justice require that witnesses, who are a necessary part of the judicial machinery, be privileged against any restraint, excepting that imposed by the penalty for perjury. Though not a party to the former suit and judgment, the merits of that judgment cannot be re-examined by a trial of the witness’ testimony in a suit against him. The procedure, if permitted, would encourage and multiply vexatious suits and lead to interminable litigation.” 
        
       
      
    43 Starke J said at 141:  
     
      
       
        
        “The law protects witnesses and others, not for their benefit, but for a higher interest, namely, the advancement of public justice. The remedy against a witness who has given or procured false evidence is by means of the criminal law or by the punitive process of contempt of court.” (Citation omitted) 
        
       
      
    44 McTiernan J, after referring to the principle said at 145: 
     
      
       
        
        “The mischief would be immense if the person aggrieved, instead of preferring an indictment for perjury, could turn his complaint into a civil action. By universal assent it appears that in this country no such action lies.” 
        
       
      
    45 Williams J also emphasised the public purpose underlying the principle. 
     
      
    46 In R v Jurca (1986) 6 NSWLR 491 Herron DCJ undertook a lengthy analysis of the authorities relating to the operation of the immunity. Those authorities establish that “no action lies” where the immunity operates. See Henderson v Broomhead (1859) 4 H & N 569; [1859] 157 ER 964; Dawkins v Lord Rokeby (1873) LR 8 QB 255 at 264. These cases related to civil proceedings. In the case of criminal proceedings, the principle is that the immunity is from prosecution. Herron DCJ observed that it was apparent from Lord Mansfield’s comments that the court itself could deal with such conduct, but not by way of separate civil or criminal proceedings in respect of that conduct, save for the well-established exceptions to the principle, which permit prosecution for the conduct by way of, for example, contempt, perverting the course of justice, or perjury. 
     
      
    47 The exceptions to the principle were commented upon in Jamieson and Brugmans v R (1993) 177 CLR 574 at 582; [1993] HCA 48 [6], where Deane and Dawson JJ observed that the principle 
     
      
       
        
        “… must be qualified by a number of well established exceptions. In particular, in so far as criminal proceedings are concerned, it must be qualified as regards substantive administration of justice offences ( 
        such as perjury, contempt of court and, depending upon the circumstances, perverting the course of justice 
        ).” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    Their Honours continued at 583 [8]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… subject to the above-mentioned qualifications [of prosecutions for perjury, contempt of court or perverting the course of justice]  
        and to any clear statutory provision to the contrary 
        , Lord Mansfield's proposition prevents the words ‘spoken in the office’ by a party.. from being  
        made the basis of civil proceedings … or of criminal proceedings 
        .” (Emphases added) 
        
       
       
      Their Honours concluded, therefore, that the general principle applied to assertions contained in a pleading such as a statement of claim and that it had long been recognised that the immunity extended to words written in pleadings filed and served in the ordinary course of proceedings. See also Gaudron J at 594 [10]-[12].  
       
      
    48 The authorities establish that the immunity extends to a range of statements made out of court but which are connected in a relevant way to the court process. These include statements made in pleadings: Jamieson and Brugmans at 583 [8]; statements from potential witnesses in criminal proceedings made at a time when proceedings are in contemplation but not yet commenced: Evans v London Hospital Medical College (University of London) [1981] 1 All ER 715; statements made out of court that could fairly be said to be part of the process of investigating crime with a view to prosecution: Taylor & Anor v Director of the Serious Fraud Office & Ors [1999] 2 AC 177: see generally Meadow v General Medical Council [2007] QB 462 at 475 [12]; [2006] EWCA Civ 1390.  
     
      
    49 Ollis’ affidavit upon which the Commission relied is clearly within the category of material to which the immunity extends if it is otherwise applicable. 
     
      
    50 Counsel for Ollis contended that his Honour erred in finding that the immunity did not apply so as to prevent a finding that Ollis’ conduct in swearing false affidavits constituted a serious crime related activity for the purposes of s 27. Counsel referred to Jamieson and Brugmans, where the High Court held that the indictment upon which the appellant had been charged with making false statements in the course of judicial proceedings should be quashed. It was submitted that this demonstrated that the principle of immunity from suit was not a defence to a charge. Rather, it was a basis upon which a charge could not be brought. The Commission did not dispute the existence of the immunity. It contended, however, that it had no operation in respect of an application under s 27.  
     
      
    51 This disputation requires an examination of what underpins the principle so as to determine its scope and operation. 
     
      
    52 The rationale for the existence of the immunity was considered by the High Court in D’Orta-Ekanaike v Victorian Legal Aid (2005) 223 CLR 1 at 18-20 [39]-[42]; 35-36 [99]; [2005] HCA 12. Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ explained that although there were a number of reasons that supported the immunity, including the desirability of protecting persons, for example, judges and witnesses who were discharging their duties, from baseless suits, the essential underpinning of the immunity is the need for finality of litigation. Their Honours said at 20 [41]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the deeper consideration that lies beneath the principle is that determining whether the complaint made is baseless or not requires re-litigation of the matter out of which the complaint arises.” 
        
       
      
    53 The English authorities which are reviewed and summarised in Meadow v General Medical Council are relevantly consistent with the Australian authorities.  
     
      
    54 In Meadow, the question arose as to whether the immunity, in whole or in part, operated so as to preclude disciplinary proceedings being taken against Professor Meadow in respect of evidence he had given in criminal proceedings refuting the proposition that the children of the accused (the mother of the victims) might have died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The English Court of Appeal remarked upon the reluctance of the courts to extend the immunity, noting at 477 [17] that when it did operate, the immunity is absolute. Sir Anthony Clarke MR (Auld and Thorpe LLJ agreeing) held that the immunity did not extend to the disciplinary proceedings that had been instituted against Professor Meadow. However, it is important to recognise that it is accepted that the operation of the immunity protects a person who gives false evidence. That evidence cannot be the basis of further litigation except to the extent that the exceptions to the principle allow: see Cabassi per Starke J at 141 quoted at [43] above. 
     
      
    55 The immunity precludes the bringing of civil or criminal action other than to the extent of the recognised exceptions. It is necessary, therefore, to determine the nature and operation of an application under s 27, to see whether the immunity extends to it. The determination of this question also involves a consideration of the question whether applications under the Act constitute a statutory exception to the application of the principle: see Jamieson and Brugmans v R. 
     
      
    56 Section 5(1) of the Act provides that proceedings on an application for a restraining or confiscation order are not criminal proceedings. Applications under the Act are brought in the Supreme Court and are subject to the procedures of the Court. The rules of statutory construction of non-criminal legislation apply: s 5(2)(a). The rules of evidence for civil proceedings apply and those applicable only in criminal proceedings do not apply: s 5(2)(b). (There is an exception to this in s 22A which relates to an asset forfeiture order in respect of external serious crime related activity. That exception is not presently relevant.)  
     
      
    57 The amount assessed as being payable under s 27 is a debt payable to the Crown: s 27(1). An assets forfeiture order may be made notwithstanding that a proceeds assessment order has also been made: s 27(6). Amounts may be exempted from the sale of forfeited property in cases of hardship of a spouse or dependents: s 24, and the Court may order that payment of legal expenses be made out of property that is subject of a restraining order: ss 16A and 16B. 
     
      
    58 These provisions, taken in conjunction with the very nature of applications that may be made under the Act, which are applications to deprive persons of the proceeds of crime, demonstrate that proceedings brought under the Act by the Commission are not typically civil suits, wherein one party asserts a claim against another party. Nor do such proceedings constitute prosecution for an offence. Rather, the Act provides a regulatory regime whereby persons who are suspected of engaging in serious crime related activities are deprived of property and the proceeds of serious crime related activities are recoverable as a debt due to the Crown. Those considerations tend to a conclusion that, with respect to proceedings under the Act, being neither a criminal prosecution nor a civil suit, the immunity has no application.  
     
      
    59 This view is also supported by the manner and the circumstances in which s 27 operates. The relevant words of s 27(2) are “that the person against whom the order is sought was … engaged in a serious crime related activity”. “A serious crime related activity” is “a reference to anything done by the person that was at the time a serious criminal offence”, whether or not the person has been tried, tried and acquitted or has been convicted, even if the conviction has been quashed or set aside: s 6(1). A “serious criminal offence” is, relevantly, an offence within the category of specified offences in s 6(2)(d) that is punishable by imprisonment for five years or more. 
     
      
    60 What is required for the purposes of s 27(2) is, relevantly, proof on the civil standard that the person against whom the order is sought “engaged in” a serious criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more. The fact of immunity from prosecution or suit does not extinguish or neutralise the conduct which would otherwise form the basis of a charge or civil claim. It precludes the bringing of a charge or civil claim. However, the bringing of an application under s 27 or any other application under the Act. For instance, a restraining order or an assets forfeiture order, does not involve a prosecution of the crime constituted by the underlying conduct, or the bringing of a civil suit in the ordinary meaning of that concept. Indeed, an application under the Act may be made regardless of whether a person has been tried, or has been tried and acquitted or convicted, even if the conviction has been quashed or set aside: s 6(1). If the immunity applies, a person cannot be tried and if tried, the conviction must be quashed, as was the case in Jamieson and Brugmans.  
     
      
    61 Approaching the matter that way, the question becomes whether, if there is immunity from prosecution or from suit for the offence constituted by swearing the false affidavit, can it be said that the person who has sworn that affidavit has “engaged in a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more”? In other words, if the offence could not be made the subject of prosecution so that a person could not be punished for it, could it be said that that person has engaged in a serious crime related activity as defined? 
     
      
    62 The posing of these alternate questions reveals the difficulty of the issue before the Court. Does one focus on the conduct said to constitute the serious crime related activity, or upon the offence which is punishable by imprisonment for a specified period for the purposes of s 27? If the correct approach is to have regard to the conduct, then I consider that the immunity would not operate so as to prevent reliance by the Commission upon conduct which, in this case, would constitute an offence under s 178BB of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    63 On the other hand, if, in seeking to determine whether the immunity applies, one asks the question whether a “serious criminal offence” has been made the basis of an application under the Act, then the focus is on the commission of the offence with the consequent liability to punishment, so that the operation of the immunity would mean that the person had not engaged in an offence that was punishable by the relevant period of imprisonment. As Deane and Dawson JJ explained in Jamieson at 583 [8], in respect of a civil claim, the conduct cannot be “made the basis of civil proceedings”. In other words, the affidavits in the Local Court proceedings had to be the basis upon which the Commission relied for the purposes of the application for the proceeds assessment order. However, the conduct which otherwise constitutes the offence cannot, if the immunity operates, be made the basis of civil proceedings.  
     
      
    64 At this point it is necessary to return to the provisions of s 27. Section 27(1) provides that the Commission may make an application for a proceeds assessment order for the payment of money as assessed by the court as the value of proceeds derived from an illegal activity or activities. As such, subs (1) does not provide the juridical basis for the making of the order. That basis is properly found in subs (2).  
     
      
    65 Section 27(2) provides that the court must make an order if it is more probable than not that the person has engaged in an offence which is a serious crime related activity punishable by imprisonment for five years or more. On the basis that the relevant offence upon which the Commission sought to rely for the purposes of subs (2) was the offence under s 178BB, it was necessary for it to rely upon the affidavits in the Local Court proceedings and to prove that the evidence contained in those affidavits was false. That in itself would require that there would have to be a determination made by the Supreme Court as to whether that evidence was false so as to be able to determine whether Ollis had engaged in an offence. That consideration tends to support the view that the immunity applies.  
     
      
    66 However, it is not necessary for the purposes of s 27 (or for the purposes of s 22 relating to an application for an assets forfeiture order) that there be a conviction for the offence relied upon to found the application: see s 6(1). That refocuses attention on the conduct. However, there is another consideration which, in my view, is determinative of the issue. The very purpose of the legislation is to recover proceeds of crime, so that persons cannot benefit from illegal activity. It is not necessary that the serious crime related activity relied upon to found an application be the one that was the source of the ‘proceeds of crime’ that the State seeks to attach. But it may be. If the offence upon which the application was based was the source of the proceeds of crime sought to be attached, it would defeat the very object and purpose of the Act if that offence could not be relied on because of the operation of the immunity. The position must be the same if the offence relied upon is some different offence than that from which proceeds of crime are obtained. Reliance upon some such different offence is permitted by the terms of the section. The Act must govern and the immunity must operate in a consistent and principled way and that would not happen if the immunity operated in the case of an offence which was not the source of the proceeds but did not operate in the case of an offence which was the source of the proceeds.  
     
      
    67 It seems to me, therefore, that not only is an application under the Act not a prosecution or a civil suit, but the intention of the Act is to operate upon conduct which constitutes a serious criminal offence so as to provide a statutory exception to the operation of the immunity: see Jamieson and Brugmans v R at 583, [8]. It follows therefore that this challenge to his Honour’s judgment must fail.  
     
      
       
      Fourth and fifth issues: perverting the course of justice 
       
      
    68 The Commission contended alternatively that Ollis had engaged in serious crime related activity by making false statements and in so doing intended to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 of the Crimes Act. The meaning of “pervert the course of justice” is contained in s 312, which provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        “A reference … to perverting the course of justice is a reference to obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice or the administration of the law.” 
        
       
      
    69 The Commission’s reliance upon s 319 was important because an offence under that section is not subject to the common law principles of witness immunity: Jamieson and Brugmans v R. 
     
      
    70 Counsel for Ollis submitted, however, that his Honour erred in finding it was more probable than not that Ollis engaged in conduct which would amount to a contravention of s 319. Rather, it was submitted that the conduct upon which the Commission relied, namely the swearing of false affidavits, constituted the offence of perjury under s 327 or false swearing under s 330 of the Crimes Act and accordingly, such conduct could not, or at least should not, be taken as the basis for some other offence, such as an offence under s 319.  
     
      
    71 The basis for this submission was that the offences of perjury and false swearing are contained in a separate Division of Pt 7 of the Crimes Act from s 319 and, further, may only be prosecuted in the circumstances specified in s 338, which provides that a person is not to be prosecuted for perjury except by the Director of Public Prosecutions, or at the direction of the Attorney-General, or by any other person with leave of the judicial officer who constituted the judicial tribunal before which the perjury is alleged to have been committed. It was submitted that it could not have been the intention of the legislature that a person who had committed the offence of perjury and who could only be prosecuted in the circumstances prescribed by s 338, could also be prosecuted for another offence based upon the same conduct. It was then argued that perjury is not one of the offences which is specifically mentioned in s 6(2)(d) of the Act.  
     
      
    72 The trial judge observed at [32] that most criminal activity will contravene more than one legislative prohibition and relevantly, in a given area, conduct might constitute perjury and also constitute a contravention of s 319. His Honour considered that this was so in this case. His Honour’s conclusion on this is correct: see Butler v Attorney General for the State of Victoria (1961) 106 CLR 268; [1961] HCA 32; Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57; Clarkson v R [2007] NSWCCA 70.  
     
      
    73 In his argument on the appeal, senior counsel for the Commission also submitted that perjury, as a matter of ordinary parlance, was an offence that involved perverting the course of justice. The submission was that the offences referred to in s 6(2)(d) were described generically. Thus the reference to the offence of theft would include, for example, the various offences of larceny, certain offences of break and enter and the various offences of stealing. The specification of an offence involving tax or revenue evasion would provide another fertile field of examples. The restriction in any particular case is that the offence must be one that is punishable by imprisonment for five years or more.  
     
      
    74 In my opinion, this submission should be accepted. Section 6(2)(d) does not refer to specific offences as such. Rather, it refers to an offence that involves each of the specified categories of an offence. Therefore, the fact that the section does not identify perjury in express terms does not mean that the offence of perjury does not fall within its terms. If perjury is committed in circumstances where the falsehood was told in order to pervert the course of justice, as would be the case where the falsehood was told in order to obtain a concession, benefit or result in proceedings that would not otherwise be available, that, in my opinion, would satisfy the concept of perverting the course of justice within the meaning of s 6(2)(d).  
     
      
    75 Notwithstanding that the Commission was entitled to rely upon an offence under s 319 and notwithstanding that Ollis’ conduct might also have constituted perjury or false swearing, that does not resolve the question whether the court could have entered summary judgment for a proceeds assessment order based on that offence. In considering this question, for the reasons I have given above, it is necessary to determine, on the evidence before the Court, whether there was a real question to be tried.  
     
      
    76 An offence under s 319 involves the doing of an act or the making of an omission with intent in any way to pervert the course of justice. Intent may be inferred in circumstances where the conduct relied upon as the basis for the offence has an obvious or manifest tendency to pervert the course of justice: The Queen v Rogerson (1992) 174 CLR 268; [1992] HCA 25; Meissner v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 132; [1995] HCA 91.  
     
      
    77 On the evidence that Ollis gave on the s 12 examination, a court might be satisfied on the civil standard that he made the statements with reckless disregard as to whether the statements were true, false or misleading. A court may also be satisfied on that evidence that he made the statements with intent to obtain a financial advantage. After all, it might be thought that that was the very point in making the statements, namely, to provide evidence to the Court to support an application for payment by instalments of a judgment debt.  
     
      
    78 However, proving that a false statement has been made recklessly does not necessarily establish that the false statement was made with the requisite intent to pervert the course of justice, being the alternate charge that the Commission relied upon for the purposes of s 27. Ollis’ evidence on this raised a question as to whether he had the requisite intent to do so. That being so, it could not be said that there was no real question to be tried and accordingly, the Court should not have entered summary judgment.  
     
      
       
      The form of the orders 
       
      
    79 Finally, Ollis contended that an order made under s 27 had to specify the illegal activities the proceeds of which were to be assessed. It was submitted that this was apparent from the wording of s 27, and in particular, s 28. Having regard to the conclusion I have reached above, it is not necessary to determine this point as the orders should be set aside. However, I will consider it briefly. 
     
      
    80 Section 27 is set out at [10] above. Section 28 provides, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “28 Assessment of proceeds of serious crime related activity 
         
         
        (1) For the purpose of making an assessment under section 27 in relation to the proceeds derived by a person (in this section called  
        the defendant 
        ) from an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of the person or another person the Supreme Court is to have regard to the following matters:  
         
         
          
          (a) the money, or the value of any interest in property other than money, directly or indirectly acquired by:  
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (i) the defendant, or 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (ii) another person at the request, or by the direction, of the defendant, 
            
           
          
         
         
        because of the illegal activity or activities, 
         
         
          
          (b) the value of any service, benefit or advantage provided for:  
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (i) the defendant, or 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (ii) another person at the request, or by the direction, of the defendant, 
            
           
          
         
         
        because of the illegal activity or activities, 
         
         
          
          (c) the market value, at the time of the illegal activity or of each illegal activity, of a plant or drug similar, or substantially similar, to any involved in the illegal activity or each illegal activity, and the amount that was, or the range of amounts that were, ordinarily paid for an act similar, or substantially similar, to the illegal activity or each illegal activity, 
          
         
         
          
          (d) the value of the defendant’s property before and after the illegal activity or each illegal activity, 
          
         
         
          
          (e) the defendant’s income and expenditure before and after the illegal activity or activities. 
          
         
         
        (2) If evidence is given at the hearing of an application for a proceeds assessment order that the value of the defendant’s property after an illegal activity or illegal activities of the defendant exceeded the value of the defendant’s property before the activity or activities, the Supreme Court is to treat the excess as proceeds derived by the defendant from the activity or activities, except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme Court is satisfied the excess was due to causes unrelated to an illegal activity or activities. 
         
         
        (3) If evidence is given at the hearing of an application for a proceeds assessment order of the amount of the defendant’s expenditure during the period of 6 years before the making of the application for the order, the Supreme Court is to treat any such amount as proceeds derived by the defendant from an illegal activity or activities, except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme Court is satisfied the expenditure was funded from income, or money from other sources, unrelated to an illegal activity or activities.” 
        
       
      
    81 The submissions themselves were brief. Counsel for Ollis simply pointed out that when regard is had to, for example, the wording of subs (2), it would appear that it was contemplated that the Court would not only make a proceeds assessment order, but would also specify the illegal activities in respect of which the proceeds were to be assessed. 
     
      
    82 Section 27(1) provides that the Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for a proceeds assessment order requiring a person to pay to the Treasurer 
     
      
       
        
        “… an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by the person from an illegal activity … whether or not any such activity is an activity on which the application is based.”  
        
       
      
    83 In the circumstances here, it would be open to the Court to make a proceeds assessment order in respect of the illegal activity constituted by Ollis’ operation of the ATR facility, notwithstanding that that was not the serious crime related activity upon which the Commission relied for the purposes of s 27(2). Likewise, orders could be made in respect of other illegal activity.  
     
      
    84 The submission in respect of the form of order was made in the context of the Court making a proceeds assessment order, without proceeding to make the assessment. There was no error in the Court not proceeding to the assessment immediately. There are many occasions in which an order is made which then requires a further process for the underlying quantum to be assessed. An enquiry as to damages is one example. The separate determination of damages is another.  
     
      
    85 The Court can only proceed to an assessment of the value of proceeds derived from an illegal activity. Accordingly, at the time that the court engages in the assessment process, there needs to be a specification as to what is to be assessed. That specification needs to be made by the court.  
     
      
    86 It would not be sufficient for the Commission, on the assessment process, to merely state the activities to which it sought to relate the assessment. It would need to prove that those activities were illegal activities from which value was derived. It may be appropriate, however, for the Court to make that determination in the proceedings in which the assessment is made.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    87 For the reasons I have given, the order for summary judgment should be set aside. Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Extend the time in which to file the Summons for Leave to Appeal to 4 October 2006; 
       
       
      2. Grant leave to appeal; 
       
       
      3. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      4. Set aside orders made by Rothman J on 7 June 2006; 
       
       
      5. Dismiss the Notice of Motion for summary judgment; 
       
       
      6. The respondent is to pay the appellant’s costs of the Summons for Leave to Appeal, the appeal and the costs at first instance. 
       
      
    88 HODGSON JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Beazley JA and, except in one respect, with her reasons.  
     
      
    89 The issue on which I disagree with Beazley JA’s reasons is the issue of witness immunity, identified by her as the third issue. That issue involved the construction and effect of relevant parts of ss.6 and 27 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act), namely: 
     
      
       
        
        6 Meaning of “serious crime related activity” 
         
        (1) In this Act, a reference to a serious crime related activity of a person is a reference to anything done by the person that was at the time a serious criminal offence, whether or not the person has been charged with the offence or, if charged:  
         
          
          (a) has been tried, or 
           
          (b) has been tried and acquitted, or 
           
          (c) has been convicted (even if the conviction has been quashed or set aside). 
          
         
         
        (2) In this section, a reference to a serious criminal offence is a reference to:  
         
          
          … 
           
          (d) an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more and involves theft, fraud, obtaining financial benefit from the crime of another, money laundering, extortion, violence, bribery, corruption, harbouring criminals, blackmail, obtaining or offering a secret commission, perverting the course of justice, tax or revenue evasion, illegal gambling, forgery or homicide, or 
           
          … 
          
         
         
        27 Making of proceeds assessment order 
         
        (1) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for a proceeds assessment order requiring a person to pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by the person from an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of the person or another person that took place not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order, whether or not any such activity is an activity on which the application is based as required by subsection (2) or (2A). 
         
         
        (2) The Supreme Court must make a proceeds assessment order if the Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person against whom the order is sought was, at any time not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order, engaged in:  
         
          
          … 
           
           
          (b) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more. 
           
          … 
          
         
        (5) The quashing or setting aside of a conviction for a serious crime related activity does not affect the validity of a proceeds assessment order. 
        
       
      
    90 The Commission’s contention was relevantly that, by making false statements in affidavits sworn in Local Court proceedings, Ollis had engaged in conduct which constituted an offence under s.178BB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW): 
     
      
       
        
        178BB Obtaining money etc by false or misleading statements 
         
        (1) Whosoever, with intent to obtain for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever, makes or publishes, or concurs in making or publishing, any statement (whether or not in writing) which he or she knows to be false or misleading in a material particular or which is false or misleading in a material particular and is made with reckless disregard as to whether it is true or is false or misleading in a material particular shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years. 
        
       
      
    91 In Jamieson v. The Queen (1993) 177 CLR 574, the High Court of Australia held that the appellants in that case were protected from criminal liability under s.178BA(1) of the Crimes Act in respect of false statements made in a Statement of Claim, by reason of immunity from criminal prosecution in respect of words used by a person in the ordinary course of judicial proceedings. Section 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        178BA Obtaining money etc by deception 
         
        (1) Whosoever by any deception dishonestly obtains for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years. 
         
        … 
        
       
      
    92 In Jamieson at 582-3, Deane and Dawson JJ said this: 
     
      
       
        
        The general proposition, enunciated by Lord Mansfield in  
        R v Skinner 
         ((1772) Lofft 54, at 56, 98 ER 529 at 530), that ""neither party, witness, counsel, jury, or Judge, can be put to answer, civilly or criminally, for words spoken in office"", must be qualified by a number of well-established exceptions. In particular, in so far as criminal proceedings are concerned, it must be qualified as regards substantive administration of justice offences (such as perjury, contempt of court and, depending upon the circumstances, perverting the course of justice) and offences associated therewith (such as conspiracy and attempt). Nonetheless, and notwithstanding the submissions of the Crown to the contrary, the proposition as so qualified remains valid as a general statement of common law principle. 
         
         
        It is true that, until recently, there has been a dearth of cases in which common law courts have been called upon to quash a criminal proceeding or conviction by application of the principle. That is not, however, surprising. It could scarcely be expected that prosecuting authorities would institute proceedings in disregard of a general proposition of common law principle which had been enunciated by Lord Mansfield and subsequently endorsed by strong authority including a unanimous Court of Exchequer Chamber constituted by ten judges. As Gaudron J points out in her judgment in the present appeals, that general principle is sustained by considerations of public policy. The oppressive burden of legal costs already constitutes a formidable deterrent to the citizen of ordinary means who seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts against either an instrumentality of government or a financially powerful corporation or individual. It would constitute a further significant and most undesirable disincentive if, apart from the controls against abuse of process embodied in administration of justice offences and abuse of process proceedings, such a citizen was faced with the potential threat of being subjected to the burden of criminal proceedings, instituted or initiated by such a government instrumentality or financially powerful defendant, in respect of any words which she might use in the ordinary course of such proceedings. In that regard, it is relevant to note that, as the present proceedings against Ms Brugmans illustrate, the institution of such a criminal prosecution would not necessarily be delayed until after the determination of the civil proceedings.  
         
         
        In so far as it is relevant for the purposes of the present case, and subject to the above-mentioned qualifications and to any clear statutory provision to the contrary, Lord Mansfield's proposition prevents words ""spoken in office"" by a party or her lawyer from being made the basis of civil proceedings for defamation or misrepresentation or of criminal proceedings such as a prosecution for criminal defamation or criminal fraud. In the case of a party or her lawyer, the phrase ""words spoken in office"" at least encompasses ""anything said ... in the ordinary course of any proceeding in a court of justice"", ""although falsely and maliciously and without any reasonable or probable cause"". That being so, the general principle is applicable to assertions contained in a pleading such as a statement of claim, and it has long been recognized that the immunity attaching to words spoken in judicial proceedings extends to words written in the pleadings which are filed (and served) in the ordinary course of such proceedings. Indeed, not surprisingly, words spoken in pleadings provide some of the earliest instances of the application of the principle. 
        
       
      
    93 At 584, they said this: 
     
      
       
        
        There remains for consideration the question whether there is to be discerned in any relevant statutory provision a legislative intent precluding or qualifying the application of the general principle to the offence of dishonestly obtaining money by deception or to the offence of attempting to commit that offence. The relevant statutory provisions are s178BA (dealing with the substantive offence) and s344A (dealing with an attempt) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Examination of their terms discloses nothing at all which could properly be seen as evidencing a legislative intent to qualify or preclude the application of the relevant principle either generally in relation to ""words spoken"" in the course of judicial proceedings or particularly in relation to words contained in a statement of claim served upon a defendant in the course of such proceedings. 
        
       
      
    94 Toohey and McHugh JJ dissented, on the basis that the general exclusion of criminal liability for statements made in the course of and with respect to judicial proceedings, did not preclude a prosecution under s.178BA of the Crimes Act based on the instigation of those proceedings. However, on that matter, I note that the third judge of the majority, Gaudron J, said this at 593-4: 
     
      
       
        
        In my view, it is not possible, in circumstances such as those with which these appeals are concerned, to distinguish between the instigation of legal proceedings by service of originating process and the making of statements in that process. The central feature of an offence under s178BA is deception. In the context of an allegation of deception or, indeed, of dishonesty of any kind, service of originating process cannot be viewed in isolation from what is said in it. It is only by having regard to what is, in fact, said and claimed, that service of originating processes can, in any way, assume a deceptive or dishonest aspect. Thus, as the appellants claim, a prosecution under s178BA of the Crimes Act, based on service of a statement of claim is, in substance and effect, a prosecution for what is said in it. However, that does not dispose of the appeals for s178BA does not, in terms, exclude the instigation of judicial proceedings, statements made in originating process or, even, statements made in the course of those proceedings from the offence which it creates, and it is, thus, necessary to consider whether all or any of these acts fall within its terms. 
        
       
      
    95 Gaudron J then continued at 594-5: 
     
      
       
        
        The best known statement of the privilege on which the appellants rely for their primary argument is that of Lord Mansfield in  
        R v Skinner 
        : ""neither party, witness, counsel, jury, or Judge, can be put to answer, civilly or criminally, for words spoken in office"". 
         
         
        That statement has been accepted as authoritative on many occasions, but it must be remembered that, so far as the criminal law is concerned, it is subject to a number of clear exceptions. Thus, perjury, contempt, perverting the course of justice and their associated offences are exceptions to or stand outside the privilege, they being offences which may, and usually do, involve statements made in the course of legal proceedings. 
         
         
        Perjury, contempt and perverting the course of justice are offences which serve to protect the integrity of the judicial process. The privilege which attaches to statements made in the course of legal proceedings also serves important functions in relation to that process: it promotes resort to the courts for the resolution of justiciable issues; and, it protects the judgments of the courts from collateral attack. 
         
         
        The importance of the two separate functions served by the privilege which attaches to statements made in the course of legal proceedings appears in a passage in the judgment of Rich ACJ in  
        Cabassi v Vila 
         ((1940) 64 CLR 130, at 139). In that case the complainant in assault proceedings attempted to bring civil proceedings for conspiracy based on the giving of false evidence in the proceedings for assault. His Honour said:  
         
          
          ""An action by the defeated party cannot ... be maintained against a witness or witnesses for giving false testimony in favour of his opponent. Public policy and the safe administration of justice require that witnesses, who are a necessary part of the judicial machinery, be privileged against any restraint, excepting that imposed by the penalty for perjury. Though not a party to the former suit and judgment, the merits of that judgment cannot be re-examined by a trial of the witness' testimony in a suit against him. The procedure, if permitted, would encourage and multiply vexatious suits, and lead to interminable litigation"".  
          
         
         
        Resort to the courts for the orderly resolution of disputes between citizens, or between citizens and government, would be greatly put at risk if witnesses were to be subject to restraints with respect to their evidence, other than those which serve to protect the integrity of the judicial process. It would be put at even greater risk if litigants were not similarly privileged in respect of the instigation of proceedings. Of course, there are also restraints in that regard. 
        
       
      
    96 Two questions arise: 
     
      
      (1) Is activity of the kind specified in s.178BB, to which witness immunity applies, “a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more” within s.27(2)(b) of the Act? 
       
      (2) If so, does witness immunity apply to protect the person against the making of a proceeds assessment order? 
       
      
    97 The second question involves two subsidiary questions: 
     
      
      (a) Are proceedings for such an order proceedings to which the immunity extends? 
       
      (b) Does the Act disclose an intention to exclude the immunity? 
       
      
    98 As regards question (1), s.27(2)(b) of the Act, together with ss.6(1) and (2)(d) of the Act, require consideration whether what was done by Ollis was, at the time, “an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more and that involves … fraud”.  
     
      
    99 In my opinion, even accepting that what was done did include all the elements specified in s.178BB, it could not be considered as being “an offence that is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more”, because witness immunity meant that it was not punishable at all. The contrary view, that once you have the elements specified in s.178BB, you automatically have an offence under s.178BB, which is by s.178BB made punishable by imprisonment for 5 years, seems to me to be a strained and artificial reading of the words. The conduct was not punishable at all; so in my opinion it was not conduct that was an offence punishable by imprisonment. 
     
      
    100 If that view is wrong, question (2) would arise. I accept that the circumstances giving rise to witness immunity should not be extended, unless it is necessary to do so: Mann v. O’Neill (1997) 191 CLR 204 at 213-14. However, that is a different question from whether the consequences of immunity should be applied more widely than to criminal and civil proceedings strictly so called. In Meadow v. General Medical Council [2007] QB 462, the English Court of Appeal held that witness immunity did not apply to protect an expert witness from professional disciplinary proceedings in respect of evidence given in court; although I note that the Court of Appeal in that case did not recognise that the immunity applied to criminal as well as civil proceedings, and did not recognise the distinction I have drawn between extending circumstances giving rise to the immunity and extending the consequences of immunity. 
     
      
    101 In my opinion, having regard to the justification for the immunity as explained in Jamieson, the immunity does apply to proceedings that, although not civil or criminal proceedings, narrowly construed, are court proceedings resulting in serious adverse consequences. Proceedings under the Act would in my opinion be considered as proceedings for a civil penalty, such as would attract the privilege against self-incrimination. In my opinion it would be an odd result if they were not proceedings to which witness immunity applied.  
     
      
    102 The second aspect to question (2) is whether the legislature has shown an intention to displace the immunity. It has not done so by express words, and in my opinion it has not done so by implication. Beazley JA says that it would defeat the object and purpose of the Act if fraudulent conduct by which money was obtained could not be relied on to attach that money. However, if that fraudulent conduct involved an offence that was an exception to the witness immunity principle, such as perverting the course of justice, it could be relied on; and it seems likely that fraudulent conduct in giving evidence, resulting in wrongful acquisition of property, would amount to perverting the course of justice. I note that the fact that conduct falling within s.178BA of the Crimes Act might also amount to perverting the course of justice did not suggest to the High Court in Jamieson that exceptions to the immunity should extend to an offence under s.178BA.  
     
      
    103 For those reasons, I am of the opinion that witness immunity applies, so that it was not available to the Commission to rely on an offence contrary to s.178BB for the purpose of obtaining a proceeds assessment order under s.27(2) of the Act. 
     
      
    104 TOBIAS JA: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgments of Beazley JA and Hodgson JA. I agree with the orders proposed by Beazley JA and with her reasons. However, because Hodgson JA has expressed disagreement with her Honour’s determination of the third issue identified by her and relating to witness immunity, I would wish to add some observations of my own. 
     
      
    105 In [99] of his judgment Hodgson JA opines that what was done by Ollis in swearing two false affidavits was not “an offence that [was] punishable by imprisonment for five years or more” as it was not punishable at all because of witness immunity. However, when read in the context of ss 6(1) and 27(5) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act), all that is required by s 27(2) is that the conduct in question constitutes an offence being one which is punishable by imprisonment for five years or more. The form of punishment (imprisonment for five years or more) is in my opinion intended to qualify or describe the offence which constitutes the relevant “serious criminal offence”; it does not qualify the particular conduct relied upon to constitute the offence itself in the sense that the offender must be liable to, or at risk of being found liable to that punishment.  
     
      
    106 In any event it is common ground that the immunity is subject to any legislative intention, express or implied, to displace it. In my opinion the immunity has been displaced by implication. Section 27(2) of the Act requires that the person against whom a proceeds assessment order is sought must have been “engaged in” a serious crime related activity. The provision therefore focuses on the nature of the conduct “engaged in” by that person rather than its legal consequences. That is, it is not concerned with the liability or potential liability of that person for his or her conduct.  
     
      
    107 By swearing the false affidavits Ollis “engaged in” the offence of obtaining money with intent to obtain a financial advantage by making the false statements contained therein. It matters not in my view that he is immune from prosecution for that offence so that it must follow that if he cannot be prosecuted then he cannot be punished for his criminal conduct. 
     
      
    108 The foregoing approach to the construction of s 27(2) is consistent with the provisions of s 6(1) of the Act which makes it irrelevant whether or not the person who engages in the relevant conduct has been charged with the serious criminal offence in question or, if charged, whether or not he has been tried and acquitted or tried and convicted and the conviction quashed or set aside. Furthermore, s 27(5) provides that the validity of the proceeds assessment order is not affected by the quashing or setting aside of a conviction for a serious crime related activity being a serious criminal offence that is punishable by imprisonment for five years or more that involves, inter alia, fraud. 
     
      
    109 Thus if Ollis had been prosecuted, tried and convicted of an offence under s 178BB but the indictment and, therefore, the conviction subsequently quashed due to his immunity from prosecution, that result would not affect the validity of the order. As Beazley JA observes in [60] above, the fact of immunity from prosecution or suit does not extinguish or neutralise the conduct which would otherwise form the basis of a criminal charge or civil claim. The offence is nonetheless committed (that is, “engaged in”) even if the perpetrator can never be tried or prosecuted for it.  
     
      
    110 Accordingly, upon the true construction of s 27(2) of the Act, in my opinion it was open to the Commission to rely upon the swearing of the false affidavits by Ollis as conduct “engaged in” by him and constituting an offence under s 178BB for the purpose of the making of the proceeds assessment order. Although Ollis could not be prosecuted for that offence due to his immunity, he nevertheless “engaged in” conduct involving that offence within the meaning of s 27(2)(b). That was sufficient to engage the Supreme Court’s power to make the proceeds assessment order.

    JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR: 1 The offender is Jamie Samuel George Whybrow. He was born on 17 October 1985. Accordingly, he was aged twenty years six months when, on 23 April 2006, he was involved in the subject motor vehicle collision and he is aged twenty-two years now.2 The offender is the third child of his parents’ four children. He has two older and one younger brothers. Both his parents and all his siblings are alive.3 The offender was raised by his parents until their separation when he was aged twelve years. Thereafter, he was raised by his mother alone until her remarriage and, thereafter, by his mother and stepfather. He has two step siblings as a result of his mother’s remarriage. 4 The offender’s upbringing by both his mother and father until their separation and then by his mother and stepfather was pleasant and uneventful. Although he does not have close contact with his father and his oldest brother, he has close contact with his mother, stepfather and other siblings.5 The offender completed year 10 at Wyong High School and he obtained the School Certificate. After leaving school, he commenced an apprenticeship as a motor mechanic and obtained a certificate as a motor mechanic.6 On 17 October 2005 the offender enlisted in the Australian Army. He has completed his basic training and has been placed in the Rifleman Wing of the School of Infantry. He has performed his duties to the required standard. As a result of his imprisonment for the commission of the subject offences, he will be discharged from the Army.7 The offender is married. He is the stepfather of his wife’s two children, one aged ten aged and the other aged six years, from her earlier marriage. He is the father of his wife’s child aged six months.8 The offender was in good physical and mental health until the subject motor vehicle collision. However, as a result of the collision, he suffered numerous significant injuries, as detailed in the report of Dr Pollock, Exhibit 2, for some of which he underwent surgical repair. He has made a good but not complete recovery from his injuries.9 The offender is not a criminal. He has an unblemished character (see Exhibit AA). He is well liked by people who know him (see Exhibits 4 and 5). He is well regarded by those who supervise him (see Exhibits 1, 3, 6 and 7). 10 The offender was issued with a learner’s permit on 10 December 2001 and a driver’s licence on 24 October 2004. Before the subject motor vehicle collision he had not committed any driving offence in New South Wales (see Exhibit AB) but he had committed four driving offences in Queensland (see Exhibit AC). The driving offences are minor and pale into insignificance when compared with the subject offences.11 As I have said already, the collision in which the offender was involved occurred on 23 April 2006. It occurred at about 12.45am on Sparks Road at Warnervale. It caused the deaths of Mr Patrick Thomas and his wife Mrs Ann Thomas and the serious injury to their daughter Ms Kate Thomas, in addition to the significant injuries to the offender. It has changed forever the lives of Ms Thomas (see Exhibit B2) and her siblings Mr Hamish Thomas (see Exhibit U), Mr Lachlan Thomas (see Exhibit V) and Mr Patrick Thomas (see Exhibit W) and, albeit perhaps to a lesser extent, the lives of the extended family of Mr and Mrs Thomas (see Exhibits X, Y and Z) and also the lives of the offender, his wife and their children.12 The circumstances in which the collision occurred are not in dispute. They are set out in the statement of facts, Exhibit A, the statements of Ms Thomas, Exhibit B1, and the statements of people who came upon the collision (see Exhibits C to G inclusive). The place at which the collision occurred can be seen on the map, Exhibit H, and the photographs, Exhibit K. The extent of the damage to the motor vehicle being driven by Mr Thomas and that being driven by the offender can be seen in the photographs, Exhibit K. The nature and the extent of the injuries suffered by Mr and Mrs Thomas are detailed in the reports Exhibits N and Q respectively. The injuries suffered by Ms Thomas are detailed in the report of the treating doctor, Exhibit R. The police investigation of the collision is outlined in the statements of police, Exhibits L and M. The blood alcohol concentration of the offender at the time of the collision is revealed by Exhibits S and T.13 What happened was this. During the day and night of Saturday 22 April 2006 the offender had been somewhere, and I do not know where, with someone, and I do not know who, and had consumed a considerable quantity of intoxicating liquor, and I do not know the quantity. At about 11.45 am on Sunday 23 April 2006 he was driving a motor vehicle, Hyundai Accent sedan, registered number TSR-387, in a westerly direction along a sweeping right-hand curve on Sparks Road in Warnervale at an unknown speed. The offender was alone in the vehicle that he was driving. At the same time, Mr Thomas was driving a motor vehicle, Ford Laser sedan, registered number YAK-091, in an easterly direction along the curve of Sparks Road at an unknown speed towards the motor vehicle being driven by the offender. Mr Thomas had his wife on the front passenger’s seat and his daughter on the rear seat in the vehicle that he was driving. At a place about 300 metres to the west of the intersection of Sparks Road with Warnervale Road, which is also known as Albert Warner Drive, the vehicle being driven by the offender collided into the vehicle being driven by Mr Thomas. The collision was caused by the offender causing or allowing the vehicle that he was driving to leave the westbound side of Sparks Road and cross over the double unbroken centre lines onto the eastbound side of Sparks Road and into the path of the vehicle being driven by Mr Thomas. Tyre marks, commencing about fifty-eight metres from the rear of the vehicle that the offender was driving, and travelling from the westbound side onto the eastbound side of Sparks Road, suggest that the offender had applied the brakes of the vehicle that he was driving at some place greater than fifty-eight metres from the place of the collision and that the brakes had locked the wheels, leaving the tyre marks on Sparks Road.14 On 6 June 2006 the offender was charged in Newcastle police station with, inter alia, the following offences:   
     
      
      (1) Aggravated dangerous driving causing the death of Mr Thomas; 
       
      (2) aggravated dangerous driving causing the death of Mrs Thomas; and  
       
      (3) aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm to Ms Thomas.  
      
    After being charged, he was released on his bail to appear later in a Local Court to answer the charges.15 In due course, on 8 February 2007 the offender appeared before a magistrate in the Local Court at Wyong to answer the charges. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and he was committed to appear in this Court on a date to be fixed for his trial.16 Consequently, on 30 April 2007 the offender appeared before Judge Charteris in this Court for arraignment with the charges. On being arraigned, the offender pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial was fixed for 27 August 2007.17 However, on 27 July 2007 the offender appeared before me in this Court and he was again arraigned with the charges and he pleaded guilty to them. I stood over the sentencing proceedings to 18 October 2007, later changed to 24 October 2007.18 Accordingly, on 24 October 2007 the offender appeared before me in this Court for sentence. I received documentary material from the Crown Prosecutor and the offender’s counsel and I heard evidence from the offender and his wife and submissions from counsel as to sentence after which I stood over the sentencing of the offender to today. I do not doubt the evidence of the offender or his wife. I do not doubt what she has said in the statement now Exhibit 9 tendered today. 19 I am now to impose sentences upon the offender for the offences to which he has pleaded guilty.20 Before I continue there are two things I wish to say. Firstly, I extend to the children and family of Mr and Mrs Thomas the Court’s condolences for their great loss. Secondly, I wish to explain the process of sentencing an offender. Determination of an appropriate sentence to impose upon an offender for an offence involves the taking into account of, and the balancing of, many factors. The purposes of sentencing is outlined in s 3(A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in these terms:  
     
      
      “The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:  
       
      (a)To ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offences;  
       
      (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences 
       
      (c) to protect the community from the offender;  
       
      (d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender;  
       
      (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her action; 
       
      (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender; 
       
      (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community”. 
      
    The objective seriousness of an offence must be determined and taken into account. The subjective features of the offender must be determined and taken into account. Any aggravating or mitigating factors as outlined in s 21(A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act must be determined and taken into account. Deterrence, both personal and general, must be taken into account. Some of the factors pull in one direction and others pull in the opposite direction. A balance must be struck between the competing factors. I know that nothing can bring back Mr and Mrs Thomas and that nothing can heal the pain that their children and extended family feel because of their deaths and the anger that they feel towards the offender for causing their deaths. But I hope that they will accept and believe that I have applied the appropriate sentencing principles and that I have endeavoured to strike the correct balance between the competing factors in the sentences that I will impose upon the offender for the offences.21 The offences of aggravated dangerous driving causing death is one contrary to s 52(A) subs 2 of the Crimes Act, for which the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a maximum of fourteen years. It is an offence which cannot be dealt with summarily. It is an offence which does not carry a standard non parole period.22 The offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm is one contrary to s 52(A) subs 4 of the Crimes Act, for which the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a maximum of eleven years when dealt with on indictment, or imprisonment for a maximum of eighteen months if dealt with summarily. It also is an offence which does not carry a standard non parole period.23 However, the offences of dangerous driving causing death and dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm are offences to which the guideline judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal is Jurisic and Whyte apply. The guideline is that, for a typical case involving a typical offender where the offender’s moral culpability for the offence is high, a sentence of imprisonment for less than three years in the case of death and less than two years in the case of grievous bodily harm would be inappropriate. It is to be noted that the guideline applies to simple dangerous driving causing death or grievous bodily harm, not aggravated dangerous driving causing death or grievous bodily harm.24 There cannot be any doubt that the offences committed by the offender are very serious offences. The offender’s counsel did not submit that they were not serious offences.25 The offender’s counsel submitted that the offender’s moral culpability for the offences was neither high nor low, being rather in the middle between high and low. He submitted that the only aggravating factor was the offender’s blood alcohol concentration because there was nothing to show that the offender was driving his vehicle at an excessive or unreasonable speed, or that he was driving his vehicle aggressively or competitively or in a showing off manner, or that he was driving his vehicle when he was deprived of sleep. The Crown Prosecutor did not dispute the offender’s counsel’s submission. I accept this submission but, as I commented during the sentencing proceedings, I would have liked to have had evidence of where the offender had been, with whom he had been, what quantity of intoxicating liquor he had consumed during the day and night before the collision and over what distance he had driven his vehicle before the collision.26 There cannot be any doubt that the offender, in deciding to drive his vehicle after having consumed sufficient intoxicating liquor to give him a blood alcohol reading of 0.150g of alcohol in 100ml of blood, abandoned responsibility for his driving of the vehicle. The offender’s counsel did not submit that the offender had not abandoned responsibility for his driving of his vehicle.27 The offender is entitled to a discount in sentence for his guilty pleas. They have saved the time and costs of a trial. They have relieved Ms Thomas of the need to give evidence, something which I suspect would have been painful to her. However, they were not entered at the earliest appropriate opportunity, they were entered after a date was fixed for the trial but before the date fixed for the trial. I consider that the offender is entitled to a discount in sentence of fifteen per cent on account of his guilty pleas.28 The offender’s counsel submitted that the offender, albeit that he does not have any memory of the collision, has accepted responsibility for what he had done and was remorseful for what he had done, with his remorse being shown by his guilty pleas and by what he has said to his supervisor (see Exhibit 3) and the psychologist when interviewed (see Exhibit 8) and me in his evidence. The Crown Prosecutor did not dispute this submission. I accept that the offender is remorseful for what he has done and that his remorse is real and genuine.29 The offender’s counsel submitted that the offender had excellent prospects for rehabilitation because he was beforehand a man of good character, with a relatively good driving record and because he has the ongoing support of his wife and his family and clearly he does have their support. I accept this submission.30 The offender’s counsel submitted that the offender was unlikely to re-offend because of his previous character and his relatively good driving record. I accept this submission.31 In determining an appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender for each of the offences to which he had pleaded guilty I must recognise the purposes of sentencing, to which I have referred already, and I must take into account such of the aggravating factors referred to in s 21(A) subs 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as are present and such are the mitigating factors referred to in subs 3 of that Section as are present and any other relevant factor.32 As to s 21(A), I consider that the only aggravating factor is that lettered (g) in subs 2 and that the mitigating factors are those lettered (b), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) and (k) in subs 3. 33 One factor not mentioned in s 21(A) is deterrence. I see personal deterrence to be of less importance in this case than it might be in another case because I consider that the offender is unlikely to re-offend. However, general deterrence is important. It is something that cannot be overlooked or undervalued. People must be made aware, by sentences imposed upon offenders, of not only the folly but also the illegality of driving after having consumed a considerable quantity of intoxicating liquor, such as in the case of this offender sufficient to give him a blood alcohol concentration of the prescribed concentration of 0.150g of alcohol in 100ml of blood.34 What, then, having regard to what I have said, is an appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender for each offence?35 The Crown Prosecutor drew my attention to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Price (2004) NSWCCA 186. I have read this judgment and I have noted what was said by the Court of Criminal appeal. 36 I consider, however, that the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Thompson (2007) NSWCCA 299, which was handed down on 24 October 2007, which was, coincidentally, the day on which I conducted the sentencing proceedings, to be more applicable. The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed an appeal by the appellant who had been sentenced to imprisonment for an overall period of ten years six months, with a non parole period of seven years and six months and parole period of three years, for two offences of aggravated dangerous driving causing death. 37 I have determined, balancing everything that I have said, but putting aside the discount for the guilty pleas, that the starting point for the offences of aggravated dangerous driving causing death is imprisonment for seven years and the starting point for the offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm is imprisonment for four years. I reduce the period of seven years by fifteen per cent, which, for ease of calculation, is one year one month, to five years eleven months, and the period of four years by fifteen per cent, which, again for ease of calculation, is eight months, to three years four months.38 Absent a special circumstance, a sentence of imprisonment for five years eleven months would be apportioned into a non parole period of four years five months three weeks, and a parole period of one year five months one week, and a sentence of imprisonment for three years four months would be apportioned into a non parole period of two years six months and a parole period of ten months.39 As to special circumstances, I consider that the offender’s age, his previous character, his relatively good driving record, the excellent prospects for his rehabilitation and the likelihood that he will not re-offend are special circumstances which allow me to apportion the sentence into a non parole period of sixty per cent of the period and a parole period of forty per cent of the period.40 As to whether the sentences should be served concurrently or consecutively or partly concurrently and partly consecutively, I realise that the three offences arise from the one collision which was the result of the one act of dangerous driving by the offender but the offender committed three offences and he must be punished appropriately for those offences. Therefore, I consider that the sentences should be served partly concurrently and partly consecutively.41 As to totality, I consider that, to properly reflect the offender’s total criminality for the three offences, the total sentence should be imprisonment for nine years, with a non parole period of five years four months and a parole period of three years eight months.42 Accordingly, Jamie Samuel George Whybrow, for each of the three offences to which you have pleaded guilty, you are convicted. I sentence you as follows:  
     
      
      (1) For the offence of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm to Ms Thomas, imprisonment for three years four months, with a non parole period of two years from 24 October 2007 to 23 October 2009, and a parole period one year four months from 24 October 2009 to 23 February 2011. 
      
     
     
      
      (2) For the offence of dangerous driving causing the death of Mr Thomas, imprisonment for five years eleven months with a non parole period of three years eight months from 24 June 2009 to 23 February 2013 and a parole period of two years three months from 24 February 2013 to 23 May 2015. 
       
       
      (3) For the offence of dangerous driving causing the death of Mrs Thomas, imprisonment for five years eleven months with a none parole period of two years three months, from 24 November 2010 to 23 February 2013, on which date you are to be eligible to be released on parole, and a parole period of three years eight months from 24 February 2013 to 23 October 2016.  
      
    43 The earliest date for your release from prison on parole is 23 February 2013. 44 I dismiss the backup charge of negligent driving causing death. 45 I convict you of the related charge of driving with the high range prescribed concentration of alcohol in your blood and sentence you to imprisonment for a fixed period of nine months from 24 October 2007 to 23 July 2008. 46 I disqualify you from holding or obtaining any licence under the relevant Legislation period of six years from today, to and including 1 November 2013.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Mr Chouh, Mr Srey, Ms Yin, Ms Oum, Mr Chea, Ms Leoung and Ms BS have each pleaded guilty to importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely heroin, contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995. The marketable quantity is two grams. The maximum penalty for this offence is twenty five years imprisonment and or a fine of $550,000.2 Each offender has been in custody since 10 October 2006. Each offender is a Cambodian national. Each pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. I propose to deal with some general matters and then specifically with each offender in the order which submissions were made to me between 17 May 2007 and 19 October 2007.3 The General Background. On 10 October 2006, Thai Airways flight TG995 arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport from Bangkok, Thailand. During the flight, one of the passengers and a co-accused in the present matter, Mr Chea, had fallen unconscious. Upon his arrival in Sydney, Mr Chea was transported to St George Hospital by members of the Australian Customs Service and custody was later passed to the Australian Federal Police.4 Mr Chea underwent emergency surgery during which 176 small pellets wrapped in a balloon type substance were retrieved from his body. Removal of the balloon type substance from the pellets revealed a quantity of heroin. Mr Chea was travelling as a member of an RTR tour group. The tour group consisted of fourteen members and the tour was for a duration of ten days visiting a number of places around Australia.5 Members of the RTR tour group travelled from Phnom Penh, Cambodia via Bangkok, Thailand. Upon arrival in Bangkok, Thailand, two members of the tour group fell ill and were admitted to hospital suffering from similar symptoms to Mr Chea. Royal Thai police have indicated that these persons were internally concealing heroin and have been charged with narcotic smuggling offences. The remaining members of the tour group travelled from Bangkok to Sydney. 6 Upon arrival in Sydney, members of the Australian Customs Service spoke with all remaining members of the RTR tour group. After speaking with these persons, all were detained as suspected of concealing narcotics internally.7 Subsequently, Mr Chea and six other members of the RTR tour group were found to be internally concealing narcotics and were charged with narcotic importation offences.8 Mr Chouh imported 149.9 grams of heroin in 159 pellets. Mr Srey imported 27.1 grams in thirty pellets. Ms Yin imported 222.9 grams in 268 pellets. Ms Oum imported 228.8 grams in 288 pellets. Mr Chea imported 146.8 grams in 176 pellets, Ms Leoung imported 169.7 grams in 218 pellets and Ms BS imported 239.2 grams in 253 pellets. Ms Leoung had 168 pellets concealed internally and fifty pellets in her luggage. All but Mr Chouh have provided assistance to the investigating authorities.9 Sothear Chouh. I will deal firstly with Mr Sothear Chouh who imported 149.9 grams. He is aged thirty-eight having been born in 1969. He is a self employed farmer in Cambodia. His date of birth is apparently incorrect. He is married and has three children. Mr Chouh grew up in Cambodia in a family of rice farmers and was the eldest of four children. Like countless other Cambodians at the time, he lived during the Khmer Rouge Pol Pot regime. During this period, his father disappeared as did his mother’s family. He attended school as a child for a total period of eight years. He initially gave an incorrect date of birth record so that he could in fact begin school at a younger age. He is able to read and write in the Khmer language.10 Later on in life, he subsequently joined the army and spent approximately four years in that capacity. He later married and that union produced three children. The ages of the children are thirteen, ten and four years of age. Mr Chou has no ties to Australia. He had not had any problems with the police in Cambodia and does not have a criminal record. 11 Before the incident before the court, he worked as a sel-employed farmer in Cambodia. The farm on which he worked was approximately one hectare in size. His residence and farm are located approximately seventeen kilometres from the nearest town and approximately seventy six kilometres from the capital, Phnom Penh.12 He lived in a wooden hut with a thatched roof with his wife, three children and mother-in-law. There were six people, therefore, residing together in a one room hut. They had no electricity and he earned approximately a hundred to $US200 per year. His eldest daughter aged thirteen has now stopped attending school to look after her other siblings. This has enabled Mr Chouh’s wife to go to work at the rice farm and on some occasions she may work on another farm as well.13 For one days work, she earned approximately 5,000 riels which equates to one dollar twenty five US. She works on the farm between 7am and 5pm. The family does not possess a bike or motorcycle. Mr Chouh previously possessed a motorcycle but he had to sell it in order to pay for medicine for his son.14 His eldest daughter used to attend school which was approximately five kilometres from their home. Mr Choun and his wife also paid for their eldest daughter to take private lessons in English and Chinese. Mr Chouh actively encouraged her to learn other languages as he believed this skill would assist her in securing work in the future. He also had to pay for her school food and for her notebooks and so forth. He is not sure, however, how much this equated in US dollars.15 Mr Chouh confirmed throughout his sentence hearing that he is aware that he will go to gaol for this offence. He stated in court that he is worried about his children’s health and wellbeing. He also revealed that he is very sorry for his offending and that he did not have time to think about what he was doing. He also expressed concerns for the health of his mother-in-law because she is very old and frail.16 In terms of the current offence, he stated that “circumstances happened to me that forced me to do this offence and the hardships I was going through”. He had hoped that he could help in alleviating these problems.17 Mr Chouh has spoken to his wife and son since being arrested and in prison for the present offence. He has not, however, told them where he currently is other than to say that he is in Australia. He has informed them that he is unsure when he will be returning to Cambodia. He wishes to save money given to him in custody from buy up to send back to his family. 18 However, during cross-examination, it was revealed that he did not know what a bank account was or even how to open a bank account. This logistical difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that he has no address for his village. It would appear that the village is located in an extremely remote part of Cambodia. There are no street names or numbers within his village. The nearest post office is approximately seven to eight hours away.19 Mr Chouh told the court that he was offered $A40,000 on condition that he brought 300 grams of heroin into Australia. He was given $US600 to buy clothes, bags and so forth for his travelling needs.20 Mr Chouh was seen by a psychologist, Emma Collins and a report was prepared dated 18 December 2006 which is an exhibit in these proceedings. It states amongst other things as follows: 
     
      
      Offence 
      . He told me that he thought he would take a chance by committing the offence because it could resolve his financial problems. He expressed a degree of regret for his conduct noting that importing drugs is wrong but he said that human greed got in the way and that he was motivated by a desire for a better life for his family.  
       
       
      He said that other than a concern for his children’s future, he has no issues being in gaol. Given the impoverished living circumstances he reports and factoring in for his low IQ, Mr Chouh’s current conditions in contemporary Australian society represent such an improvement on his home conditions that his concerns for his children aside, his standard of living has in fact been raised by coming into gaol in Australia. As such, the motivation behind the offences appear to relate to human need as opposed to what he termed human greed. 
       
       
      Presentation at Interview 
      . He denied any mood disturbance telling me that he is happy in gaol because of the luxuries he has as compared with his home life in Cambodia. 
      
     
     
      
      Psychometry Testing 
      . Mr Chouh performed very poorly achieving a result that places him within the mild mental retardation range outperforming less than the bottom one per cent of the normative sample for his age. 
      
     
     
      
      Current Clinic Issues 
      . The effect of his low IQ is to restrict his ability to think through the repercussions of his behaviour as is the case with the current offence and perhaps makes him more prone to seemingly impulsive and irrational behaviours. 
      
     
     
      
      Summary and Opinion 
      . 
       The offence represented such an opportunity to him and to some extent in his mind the advantages outweighed the disadvantages. Mr Chouh is clearly missing his children but he is otherwise comfortable within the Australian prison lifestyle. 
      
    21 Mr Chouh explained the factual situation in evidence. He said that he was very sorry for offending, that he did not give much time to thinking about what he was doing and that he would tell his friends and relatives not to be tempted to commit this offence against Australia. If he is able to work in prison, he could earn thirty seven dollars per week which he would like to send home except as I have indicated, he has no bank, bank account and the nearest post office is a long distance from his village which itself does not have an address.22 It is accepted that the plea of guilty was at the earliest opportunity and that Mr Chouh like the co-offenders was a mere courier. The principal areas of s 16A(2) that have been focussed on by all offenders are subs (l), character, antecedents, cultural background, age, means and physical or mental condition, on the one hand and on the other, subs (p), probably effect on the person’s family. 23 Although the submissions for Mr Chouh suggest I can take into account his assistance to authorities, (see p 21), there is no evidence of such except in that he apparently asked the tour guide to inform customs that he had heroin in his stomach and thereafter co-operated with the investigation. However, there has certainly not been the level of assistance provided by other offenders who are entitled to a quantifiable discount in that regard. 24 It is ironic that Mr Chouh’s income and standard of living in prison far surpasses his income and standard of living in Cambodia and the income and standard shared by his family who have now lost their sole provider.25 He and his family were living a marginal existence. The psychologist report suggests he performs less than the bottom one per cent of the normative sample for his age. He was otherwise not under any psychological disadvantage. It is submitted that there is exceptional hardship in regard to the probably effect on Mr Chouh’s family of his imprisonment. In the normal case, hardship on a prisoner’s family is not usually a cause for a reduction of sentence, the logic being that if two people commit a similar offence, it would be unfair to one to reduce the other’s sentence simply because he or she has family responsibilities. 26 Of course in Australia, there is a substantial network of social service organisations that can assist a family who has its breadwinner in prison. However, Mr Chouh’s family is not in Australia but in Cambodia and the effect on them in my view will be substantially harder than a similar family situation in Australia. The question is does that amount to an exceptional circumstance? Having regard to the decided cases, it probably does not but it is a significant factor in determining the non-parole period, not only for Mr Chouh but for other offenders as well.27 I am also asked to take into account an extra curial punishment occasioned by the potential danger to Mr Chouh’s health and his fear at seeing three other travellers collapsing from the poor packaging of the drugs for internal concealment. It is said that is why Mr Chouh told Australian Customs Service officers that he had drugs concealed internally and wanted to go to hospital. The trouble with that argument is that had no one collapsed, it is extremely doubtful if Mr Chouh would have said anything to customs on his arrival and the same can be said for the other offenders. Even if the argument was available, it would have little or no effect on the issue of penalty.28 I accept that Mr Chouh was a person of good character and he is unlikely to re-offend as a consequence of his imprisonment for this offence. I accept that he was a courier. It also seems to be the case for all of these offenders that advantage was taken of their simplicity and deprived background to apply pressure to participate in the offending. It is one thing for a reasonably intelligent person who is otherwise in an economically stable position who acts as a courier for an extra economic benefit to participate in this style of offending. I think there is a distinction between that case and the case of someone whose ability to rationalise their behaviour is limited and whose economic position is deprived and acts as a courier as a potential way out of that deprivation.29 There is also no doubt that like his co-offenders and like many foreigners who agree to courier drugs to this country, he will experience cultural and social isolation in a strange country where there are few people likely to speak his language. However, that is part of the risk that people take who choose to behave in that way. In that regard, all these offenders are no doubt substantially better off than their two co-offenders who collapsed at Bangkok Airport and were remanded in custody in Thailand and who, I am informed, probably face life imprisonment at the least or at the worst, the death penalty. By comparison with the other seven offenders, Mr Chouh is substantially equivalent with Mr Chea who imported 146.8 grams. 30 Mr Sam Srey imported 270.1 grams. Mr Srey is aged thirty five years. He is single with no children. He was employed within the police department in Phnom Penh and is described as a police officer but is in fact what appears to be a clerical assistant with no powers of arrest or detention. He was earning twenty five dollars per month. Mr Srey is the second eldest of six siblings. One of his siblings, a brother, however, was killed in a traffic accident approximately four years ago. Two of his sisters are married and live with their respective husbands. He has three younger brothers and all of his sisters work in the family business.31 Mr Srey was raised and lived in Phnom Penh. He states that he had a happy childhood. Prior to this offence, his family ran a small grocery business in Phnom Penh and he also resided there with his three brothers and two sisters. The grocery business is located in a single storey building. Mr Srey has described the area in which the shop is located as a poor suburb. The shop has four distinct areas. It has a cooking area, two other areas used for sleeping and the rest of his siblings and himself sleep in the shop area after it has closed for business.32 Mr Srey owns two small motorcycles but does not own a motor vehicle. His approximate salary is 1,000 riels which equates to twenty-five US dollars per month. He gives half of his income to his parents for board. He was employed in the police department and performs predominantly administrative duties in that capacity. 33 He has told the court that he has previously not used heroin or any other illicit substance. He claimed that he did not know anyone else who uses such substances. He said in his sentence hearing that: 
     
      
      Since I have been arrested, I have come to know the worst about drugs and I am sorry I brought drugs into this country. 
      
    34 Whilst in custody, Mr Srey is studying English. He has an AEVTI certificate in spoken and written English. He hopes to use these language skills when he returns to Cambodia and also hopes to train members of his family.35 In the course of his time in custody, he has also undertaken sewing work. He currently works five days per week and earns sixteen dollars per day in the course of this employment. Mr Srey has told the court that he saves some of that money and uses some for food. He has done a textiles TAFE course and is employed at CSI Textiles.36 He claimed that he was offered $A40,000 to come to Australia with the illegal substances in his body. He was initially bought 200 pellets to swallow but was only able to swallow a total of thirty pellets. He was allegedly told that he had not even swallowed enough to pay for the air ticket to Australia. Mr Srey was not aware how the payment would be calculated in terms of having just swallowed thirty pellets. Therefore, there was no surety that he was going to be paid or the amount to be paid given the circumstances.37 Mr Srey has also been seen by Ms Emma Collins, a psychologist and a report dated 18 December has been prepared. Amongst other things, she states as follows: 
     
      
       
      Mr Srey reports a reasonable upbringing with good family supports, educational attainment and a consistent employment history. However, his exposure to war, forced relocation and his father’s death appear to indicate quite the opposite with regards to his childhood. There was a consistent degree of emotional detachment evident through my assessment of Mr Srey and his history which may have allowed him to offend without considering the consequences. Further, he appears to have struggled somewhat in keeping up with the standards of his family whom he states are more successful than he. 
      
     
     
      
      It is concerning that Mr Srey is continuing to struggle with this issue given that he is unwilling to disclose his current circumstances to his family. Mr Srey denies any significant problems whilst in gaol other than home sickness. He states that he can eat the food and is maintaining work at present. His non English speaking background will inevitably impact upon his capacity to access education and clinical or medical treatment. 
      
    38 Mr Srey has provided a statement to the Australian Federal Police and signed an undertaking to give evidence against the organiser. His assistance is rated as being of a high value. He also gave evidence and confirmed the history obtained by Ms Collins with the exception that his evidence is that neither his father nor stepfather were arrested by the Khmer Rouge and his parents ran a small family grocery store not a trading company. Unlike many co-offenders, his parents were able to look after their children adequately.39 I accept that the plea of guilty was at the earliest opportunity and that he was a person of prior good character. I accept that the usual hardships for foreign nationals referred to in Mr Chouh’s case applies also to him. He does not come from the sort of background described by Mr Chouh and I would not classify it as being deprived but certainly it was not one of wealth and affluence.40 On the one hand, Mr Srey imported the least amount of heroin by a significant margin, although a physical condition prevented him swallowing more. On the other hand, Mr Srey’s education must have alerted him to the illegality of what he was doing and the risks associated with it. However, he has also provided a high level of co-operation.41 Ms Sinary Yin imported 222.9 grams of heroin. Ms Yin is aged thirty seven, married and has a five-year-old son and a one-year-old daughter. Throughout her evidence in the sentence proceedings, she stated that she had a hard childhood. She does not have too much recollection of the Pol Pot regime as she was just five years of age at the time. She does recall, however, that there was some shooting and that everyone just started running. She also remembers that there was not much to eat.42 Upon fleeing the shooting, her uncle made a shelter of palm leaves and they ate about one cup of rice per day. There was no clean water and the water that was available was obtained from a pothole. There was obviously no sanitation facilities, electricity or gas. They were unable to light a fire for warmth and for fear of attracting attention. Following this tumultuous period is Ms Yin’s young life, she eventually returned to her parents. She had to complete all the chores and was heavily disciplined by her parents.43 Ms Yin has two children, a son who is five years of age and a daughter who is one year old. She was not, however, living with her children when the offence was committed. The children in fact resided with Ms Yin’s mother in another village. She would visit her children between two to three times a year.44 She married predominantly as a result of cultural tradition and the wishes of her parents. Once married she experienced terrible violence at the hands of her husband. She recalled one incident in which her husband hit her to the point of unconsciousness. To compound such matters, she did not have the financial means and resources to seek medical attention for the injuries she sustained at the hands of her husband. She did not inform or report such matters to the police. She said that that sort of behaviour was a common practice in Cambodia.45 In the course of employment, Ms Yin worked as a cleaner and performed other domestic duties. She also resided within the home of her employer. On an average day she would work approximately twelve hours per day, seven days a week and her daily duties consisted of washing, cleaning, cooking and hand washing. Her monthly earnings were approximately twenty dollars US. The relationship with her employer was one that was characterised as a master servant relationship. The money Ms Yin obtained from the course of this employment was sent back to her children and her mother. She has grave concerns for the health and welfare of her children and her mother in Cambodia. Her mother is aged sixty and is particularly frail and she no longer has any other family members to support her and therefore her children.46 Ms Yin has been in custody in Mullawa since the date of her arrest. Whilst in custody she has worked in gaol putting together Qantas headsets. At Dillwynia, she packed sugar and coffee into bags. Ms Yin has saved all the money obtained in the course of this work to send back to Cambodia.47 In the psychologist’s report, she expressed that she had never had so much food as she currently has available to her in gaol. The increased exposure and availability to a wide range of foods, however, does make her feel guilty. This is because she has concerns that her children may not have any food or means to acquire food on a daily basis in Cambodia.48 Ms Yin was also seen by Ms Emma Collins and her report is dated 2 January 2007. Amongst other things it says as follows: 
     
      
       
      Background history 
      . One would expect that the mass relocation and war merely exacerbated what was clearly a neglectful and abusive childhood. This is further evidenced by the fact that Ms Yin could not report any positive memories from her upbringing. 
      
     
     
      
      Offence. 
       It appears from Ms Yin’s background that the advantageous of this offence almost outweighed the disadvantages and that she was living away from her children anyway and still struggled to provide for them. It is evident that Ms Yin was groomed into this offence from the perspective of being told it would allay her financial problems. She expressed regret for her conduct stating that she feels guilty for her actions. 
      
     
     
      
      Psychometric testing 
      . She achieved a very poor result placing her within the extreme low to border line range of ability outperforming the bottom two per cent of the normative sample for her age. Ms Yin presents with low cognitive ability which is commensurate with her very limited education and her generally poor functioning in the community. Further, she also showed very limited knowledge of the court system and other westernised lifestyle patterns and behaviour. 
      
     
     
      
      Summary and Opinion. 
       Ms Yin reports a significant history of early maladjustment marked by parental abuse, neglect, poverty and a lack of educational opportunity. Her history highlights continued and she was evidently groomed into the commission of this offence given the impact of her poor relationships, low IQ and unsophisticated functioning. Ms Yin reports relatively comfortable conditions since her incarceration compared to her life in Cambodia. However, she is clearly experiencing distress secondary to her separation from her family. This will make her adjustment to long term incarceration problematic. Her language will negatively affect her ability to adjust to a longer term custodial order. 
      
    49 Ms Yin was also seen by a Ms Armstrong who is a social worker in regard to the effect or the probable effect of her incarceration on her children. In a report dated 9 August 2007, Ms Armstrong said: 
     
      
      Although Ms Yin understands her children to be well looked after by their grandmother, she is currently unable to have any direct contact with her children and presents as being troubled by anxiety and depression as a result. It may well be the case that she fears about her mother’s ability to bear the financial burden of the children’s care now that Ms Yin is unable to contribute.  
       
       
      Cambodia has a very limited social welfare system. The children’s father is in a new relationship and his level of involvement or assistance is unknown. Ms Yin has expressed that she has had intermittent suicidal thoughts and has had times of depression and anxiety. She must be seen to be vulnerable and at risk of greater psychological fragility within the gaol system, particularly with her non English speaking background and lack of contact with her mother or children. She does not have a supportive partner and can clearly hope for little support or reassurance from her extended family.  
       
       
      It is to be hoped that some assistance can be given to Ms Yin in maintaining some rudimentary contact with her children and family and that some support systems are available will be explained to assist her in coping with the distress she is clearly experiencing.” 
      
    50 Ms Yin imported 222.7 grams of heroin, which is similar to Ms Oum who imported 228.8 grams and BS who imported 239.2 grams. She was told that she would receive $A10,000. Like Mr Srey, she has provided a statement to police and an undertaking to give evidence. Her co-operation was rated as being of high value.51 Ms Collins’ report found her only outperforming the bottom two per cent of her normative sample with a low cognitive ability. Apart from that, she did not suffer any recognisable psychological illness. She appears to be from a similar deprived background to Mr Chouh with similar family responsibilities and similar considerations should apply. She was previously of good character without criminal offences and had no associations within the drug milieu.52 For similar reasons to Mr Chouh, it is claimed that there is extra curial punishment in regard to the dangers she placed herself in as well as the separation from her children and the fact that her children are not having their basic needs met. However, unlike Mr Chouh, I note that she is a sole parent.53 Sophia Oum imported 228.8 grams. Ms Oum is aged thirty-five, married with three children aged fifteen, thirteen and ten. She is the only child and therefore does not have any biological brothers and sisters. During the Pol Pot regime she was taken away on a truck along with a number of other children. At the age of approximately six, she and another fifteen or so children were beaten. Only two of the children survived as a result of the beatings and Ms Oum was one of these children. She vividly recalls being thrown into a pile of bodies and pretending to be dead.54 After a considerable amount of time she and the other children ran off into the Cambodian jungle. Ms Oum resided in a children’s camp during the Pol Pot regime. She can recall that there were approximately ten to twenty children within the camp and that some children died from starvation and malnutrition. 55 The ages of the children within the camp ranged from two to six years of age. Children including herself were supervised by three adults. She recalls that no clothing was provided either to herself or the other children in the camp and that food supplies were minimal. She described that in the morning she would consume rice porridge, a small handful, as well as the same at night.56 Sometimes she recalls that she would be given rice porridge mixed with vegetables. Her accommodation at the camp consisted of a bamboo hut with a palm tree roof. There were no beds. Often all the children would huddle together for body warmth on the bamboo floor. She recollects that it was often cold and rainy at night.57 The water that was used for food and cleaning was gathered from a nearby pond. She remembers that the water was murky and muddy coloured and was obviously not fit for consumption. 58 Ms Oum did not receive an education in Cambodia as a child. Her parents were executed during the regime. She stated that during the sentence her parents were forced to dig their own graves. Were blindfolded, hit on the head and buried in the graves. Her sister was also executed.59 Ms Oum was married and has three children. Her husband works as a motorbike taxi driver and she was employed selling second-hand clothes. She told the court that she would sell second-hand clothes from under an umbrella and would sell the clothing on the street. She would usually break even.60 Ms Oum and her family resided in a home made of fibro and wood. Her husband, children and herself all lived in a home which consisted of only one room. There was no electricity and they would obtain firewood for warmth and lighting. Their home was approximately one hour from Phnom Phen by motorcycle. 61 Following her arrest her husband now looks after the children. She has spoken to him over the telephone and he has told her that life is very difficult. Ms Oum stated that she is devastated and sorry about what has happened to her children. They are no longer attending school and her husband has limited financial capacity and ability to effectively support the family unit.62 She does not speak English and has great difficulty communicating and will thus face cultural isolation whilst in custody. She is however undertaking an English course but finds concentrating difficult. She also worked at Dillwynia putting products into plastic bags. She worked five days per week and earned approximately twenty three dollar, seventy cents. She spends some of her earnings on making telephone calls and on food. She has saved approximately fifty to $100 and plans to use that for her business when she returns to Cambodia.63 Throughout the sentence proceedings she openly stated that she was sorry for what she did. She had no previous experience with drugs before and has now seen the effects of drugs on other people whilst in prison. She realises now that she should not have brought illegal drugs into Australia. She stated that she would never do it again no matter how much was offered to her. 64 She also expressed relief when she had been caught. The forms of medical intervention that were made available to her once caught may have prevented the pellets from bursting in her stomach. She was offered $100 per pellet and she would be paid upon delivery of the pellets in Australia, 288 pellets would therefore result in a payment of $28,800.65 She also stated that she was given $US500 prior to coming to Australia. She used this money to buy clothes and luggage. She left $US100 to spend and use once she arrived in Australia. She left thirty US dollars behind for her children.66 Initially she vomited 60 of the pellets when she was told to swallow all of the pellets which was initially 290. She was told that if she did not swallow all the pellets she would have to refund the $500. She had planned to use the money to buy a home and a waterproof store to sell clothes.67 Ms Oum has been seen by Ms Collins and Ms Armstrong. Ms Collins obtained her background history. She also went on to say as follows: 
     
      
      Relationship history. 
       Ms Oum lived in relative poverty despite some security of tenure. She explained that her children can no longer attend school because of her limited finances and her husband reported only makes enough money to feed them. 
      
     
     
      
      Offence. 
       She advised that this money would alleviate her financial worries and allow her family to live comfortably. She expressed regret of her conduct stating that she did not consider the ramifications of her actions. Ms Oum stated that the financial gain was the motivating factor for the commission of this offence. 
      
     
     
      
      Psychometric testing. 
       She achieved a score that places her within the extremely low to borderline range of ability at performing the bottom one per cent of the normative sample for her age; it is most likely that this score slightly under represents Ms Oum’s true ability level given that she has no education and as such has not been exposed to any abstract task previously. Nevertheless, she impresses as a woman with low intellectual functioning but one who can function at a basic level in her normal community.  
      
    68 The classification of Ms Oum after psychometric testing places her in a similar situation to Ms Yin and Mr Chouh. Ms Armstrong reported as follows: 
     
      
      Ms Oum reports having episodes of fainting from and undiagnosed cause and as the psychologist report suggests, this may be related to elevated anxiety and stress. Ms Oum has not complained of any elements of her imprisonment other than worrying about her children’s welfare. She presents as operating from a point of anxiety in most of her functioning but this would be consistent with someone who has had an early history of exposure to war and personal trauma in childhood. Ms Oum must be considered to be at risk of depression, increased anxiety, social isolation and disadvantage by not speaking the language of the country in which she is imprisoned. 
      
     
     
      
      She will be unlikely to avail herself of clinical support of counselling programs partly due to the language barrier and possibly also due to her focus consistently being concern for her children’s situation rather than her own.  
      
    69 I note that her children are being looked after by her father. Like Mr Srey and Ms Yin she has undertaken to give evidence and her information is also rated as being of high value. Similar submission are made for Ms Oum as have been made for Ms Yin and Mr Chouh in regard to extra curial punishment, effect on family and past history and antecedents.70 I would regard Ms Oum as coming from similarly deprived circumstances as Ms Yin and Mr Chouh and of a similar psychological profile. Likewise, she was previously of good character and not involved in any drug subculture. Each of Mr Srey, Ms Yin, Ms Oum, Ms Leoung and BS have provided statements to the Australian Federal Police and undertaken to give evidence against the organiser. Each has been assess as providing information of a higher value by the Australian Federal Police. 71 Whilst there does not appear to be any risk of repercussions against them in regard to their current imprisonment, each will eventually be returned to Cambodia where the same situation may not apply. In that regard they are all in a similar position and I see no reason to vary the amount of discount that each should receive for the assistance given and the evidence to be provided which are essentially one and the same. I note that in all probability they will be required to give evidence at committal and at trial. I will allow a twenty per cent for their cooperation.72 The problems facing the sentencing of offenders who conceal drugs and travel as a group has been examined in three decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal; R v PP [2005] NSWCCA 214; King v R [2006] NSWCCA 110 and Jules v R [2007] NSWCCA 243, although the factual circumstances were somewhat different. The cases related to the same importation by five co-offenders. Beasley JA in King said this at para 39: 
     
      
      The amount of harm potentially done the to Australian community is greater the greater the quantity of drug involved. The reward to the individual for agreeing to engage in the criminal behaviour is usually dependant upon the quantity of drug. That in turn is relevant both to personal and general deterrence. 
      
    73 Her Honour found that there should have been a distinction between the offenders having regard to the amount imported despite the fact that it may well be the case that someone wanted to swallow more pellets but was physically unable to do so. 74 In the present case, as I said before, I note that Mr Srey was only able to swallow thirty pellets containing 38.8 grams of powder, 27.1 grams of which was heroin. I also noted again that in the case of Ms Leoung, she concealed 168 pellets internally containing 131.4 grams of heroin but also had fifty pellets in her luggage containing 38.3 grams of heroin making a total of 169.7 grams. It is probably debatable that general deterrence and specific deterrence ought play a significant role in the sentencing of these offenders for these offences. 75 The starting point for sentences where there’s been a plea of guilty after the appeal of s 16G and having regard to the JIRS statistics seems to be a head sentence of about seven years imprisonment, a non-parole period being around two-thirds of the head sentence. That seems to have been the case in the reported judgments that I’ve referred to.76 In determining the sentence relevant to each offender, I have taken into account the pure weight of heroin imported by each, the plea of guilty, the assistance provided where applicable and the personal circumstances of each offender and their dependants.77 Although I’m sentencing four of the offenders today and the remaining three on 2 November 2007, I can indicate that the sentences imposed on all offenders reflect the relativities of each offence and each offenders’ subjective background and further the sentences relate by way of parity to each other. In other words, Mr Chouh, Mr Srey, Ms Oum and Ms Yin suffer no disadvantage in being sentenced today instead of next week. Mr Chi, Ms Leoung and BS will not be better or differently treated for the same reason. The separation only comes about because of the fact that it wasn’t until last Friday that I received the final submissions in regard to Mr Chea, Ms Leoung and BS.78 The major reason why the sentences differ is because the amount of drug imported by the individual as well as the reduction for the assistance offered. The other factors have generally only had a relatively marginal effect on the outcome. Bearing that in mind, I make the following orders:79 Each is convicted.80 Mr Chouh is sentenced to five years and six months imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and six months to date from 10 October 2006. He is therefore eligible for release on parole on 9 April 2010.81 Mr Srey is sentenced to three years and two months imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and two months to date from 10 October 2006. He is therefore eligible for release on parole on 9 December 2008.82 Ms Yin and Ms Oum are each sentenced to five years and six months imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years to date from 10 October 2006. They are therefore eligible for release on parole on 9 October 2009.83 These sentencing proceedings are stood over part-heard until Friday, 2 November 2007 when I will deal with the remaining offenders. Each of the offenders presently before the court is excused from further attendance.

    84 HIS HONOUR: These remarks on sentencing need to be read in conjunction with my remarks on sentencing and findings in the judgment given on 25 October 2007 in regard to the co-offenders Mr Srey, Mr Chouh, Ms Oum and Ms Yin.85 Mr Chea imported 146.8 grams. Mr Chea is aged thirty six, is married with one child.86 During the flight from Bangkok Thailand to Sydney Mr Chea had fallen unconscious. It was suspected that Mr Chea was carrying narcotics internally. Upon arriving at Sydney Mr Chea was transported to St George Hospital by ambulance in company of members of the Australian Customs Service. Custody was later passed to members of the Australian Federal Police. The accused underwent emergency surgery during which one hundred and seventy six pellets were retrieved from his body. On 13 October 2006 Mr Chea was arrested and cautioned. On 14 October 2006 he was charged with the matters now before the court.87 Childhood. Mr Chea was born in the province of Preving in Southern Cambodia. His father died when he was twenty years of age. His mother is now aged fifty one years of age and is currently physically unwell. He has thirteen siblings, he has ten brothers and three sisters. He commenced school at the age of eight and left school at the age of twenty. He repeated at school three times, repeating twice in grade two and then repeating one year in grade eight. In the sentence hearing he stated that this was because he found the work very difficult.88 Whilst growing up in Cambodia he remembers living within the Pol Pot regime. “Yes I remember a little and I forget a little bit”. He claims that “nothing happened to my family” throughout the Pol Pot regime but does recall that his family was sent approximately ninety kilometres out of their town as a result of the regime.89 Throughout this period he worked looking after cattle but conceded that during the Pol Pot era, “I was hungry; sometimes I had food and sometimes I didn’t have food”. At the cessation of the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia Mr Chea joined the army when he was aged approximately seventeen years. He spent one year in the army and married at the age of twenty three. Mr Chea was employed as a motorcycle driver in Cambodia. He stated throughout the sentence proceedings that he earned the equivalent of one dollar per day. He is married and has a daughter who is thirteen years of age.90 The offender resided in a house in Cambodia which was approximately the same size as his prison cell. The walls of the house were made out of palm and leaf as well as the roof. He slept on a mat made out of palm leaf. His home did not have running water, electricity or a toilet. Since his incarceration Mr Chea’s motorcycle has been sold in order to provide money for food for his wife and daughter. He stated that “my wife didn’t have anything to eat so she had to sell the motorbike”.91 He recently informed his siblings of his incarceration approximately two months ago and they have shown anger and disbelief as to his motive for committing the offence. Once he is released he has indicated his aspiration to open a small restaurant selling food at home. He has no ties in Australia.92 Custody. Whilst in custody Mr Chea worked sewing and studied English for three months. He has however subsequently ceased studying English which he attributes to his poor memory. In his sewing job in gaol he makes curtains, pants, blouses, pillow casings, bath towels and bed sheets. He earns twenty dollars per week from this form of employment.93 Since spending time in custody Mr Chea has expressed remorse and contrition with respect to the offence. In the sentence proceedings he stated that, 
     
      
      “since my arrest I understand these offences will affect the Australian community causing trouble to them, causing breakdown in families”. 
      
    94 A clinical neuro-psychologist’s report was prepared and is dated 1 August 2007. It states amongst other things that,  
     
      
      his primal level of intellectual functioning was estimated to be in the low average to border-line range. There appears to be evidence of a slight decline in some areas of Mr Chea’s intellectual functioning from his premorbid estimate which were identified in his very poor basic non verbal reasoning skills, visuo-spatial problem solving and visual recognition. His verbal memory also appears to be mildly impaired relative to his premorbid estimate. It is difficult however to comment on whether he has sustained significant impairment in his frontal executive functions. It seems that his very poor visual organisation and planning abilities reflect an acquired deficit in these cognitive abilities. 
      
     
     
      
      Mr Chea has evidence of acquired impairment in his intellectual functions, verbal memory and frontal executive skills. Mr Chea had limited capabilities prior to his cerebral hypoxic brain injury and the further decline in his functional ability following his brain injury will have a particularly adverse affect on his life whilst in custody and in his ability to understand the proceedings of the court. 
      
     
     
      
      I do not however feel that his life situation would change very much on his return to Cambodia as he would be back in his familiar environment and this would prompt his ability to utilise previously well stored knowledge to get by. If however he was to go back under changed circumstances it is likely he would experience major problems in adapting, surviving and supporting his family. He would have been extremely vulnerable to exploitation and susceptible to any offers of money to relieve his family’s poverty. Furthermore, given his limited intellectual abilities it would seem he would not at the time have thought through any consequences or the possible legal implications of his actions. 
      
    95 Mr Chea pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and further has undertaken to give evidence against the organiser. The Australian Federal Police rate his assistance as being of a high value. There seems to be a joinder of opinion as to Mr Chea being within the border-line to low average range of intellectual functioning. The effect of a hypoxic brain injury caused by his overdose of heroin appears to have resulted in a slight decline in some areas of his intellectual functioning from what it had been before. There is no evidence that this slight decline is likely to get any worse and I do not attribute that meaning to these words “the further decline in his functional ability following his brain injury” that appear in Professor Reid’s report. All this refers to is that the additional impact of his brain injury on his premorbid condition will have an increased effect on his ability to deal with prison life. However Professor Reid also says that his injury is unlikely to affect his ability to reintegrate with his familiar Cambodian environment.96 There is no evidence before me of any other long term medical consequence of the heroin overdose. Except for the hypoxic brain ischemia the catalogue of possible consequences referred to by Professor Starmer in his report have not apparently eventuated in Mr Chea.97 It is argued that Mr Chea’s heroin overdose and its aftermath constitutes an extra-curial punishment. It is well established that when determining a proper sentence, a court can take into account any serious loss or detriment suffered by an offender as a result of committing the offence (see Daetz 2003 NSW CCA 216). In that case, Daetz had received a fractured skull and a brain injury as a result of being assaulted by friends of the victims.98 In Alameddine (2006) NSWCCA 317, the offender was seriously burned when he accidentally caused an explosion in an amphetamine laboratory. In both cases the variation in sentence allowed by the court of appeal was in the order of twenty percent of the head sentence only in the case of Mr Alameddine and one twelfth of both head sentence and non parole period for Mr Daetz. The injuries sustained by both Mr Daetz and Alameddine were far more substantial than that suffered by Mr Chea in the present case.99 I accept that Mr Chea was a person of prior good character with no involvement in drugs. As indicated previously, he and Mr Chouh imported about the same amount of heroin, one hundred and forty six grams as opposed to one hundred and forty nine grams. Mr Chouh however did not provide any assistance. I also accept that Mr Chea came from a similar deprived background with similar intellectual resources as did Mr Chouh, Ms Yin and Ms Oum. 100 Kunthea Leoung imported 169.7 grams. Ms Leoung is aged twenty five, is married with a twenty nine month old daughter with whom she arrived in Australia on 10 October 2006. The child Khemawatey has been the subject of an intervention by the Department of Community Services and is currently in foster care.101 Ms Leoung is the middle child of three children born in Phon Pham. She has an older sister and a younger brother. The sentence proceedings were mainly based on the actual offence before the court and the effects of the offence on her relationship with her daughter. There was little, if any, sentencing submissions relative to her early childhood and the effects of the Khmer Rouge on her upbringing.102 Ms Leoung in Cambodia. Ms Leoung was residing in the capital of Phon Pham, Cambodia. She resided there with her husband and daughter immediately prior to her incarceration. Whilst in Cambodia she was working on a stall selling jewellery. She stated that her whole life as she was mainly working, the only period in which she did not engage in any paid formal employment was after six months into her pregnancy.103 Her Custody in Australia. In her sentencing hearing, Ms Leoung stated that she had no idea about Australia or how long the flight was or even that there was a stopover in Bangkok and the serious penalties that could be imposed for drug importation matters there. She also added that she found out the real quantity of heroin when she was in Australia.104 Ms Leoung’s Child. In respect of the offender’s child enquiries with the New South Wales Department of Community Services has disclosed that the New South Wales Minister for Community Services has been awarding parental responsibility under s 4AAA of the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act (1946). International Social Services have conducted an assessment and found that there is no suitable person in Cambodia to take care of the child on a full time basis.105 In addition to this, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has issued bridging visa E sub-class 0 50 to the child. This type of visa allows the child to remain in Australia. The situation and status of the child however remains uncertain as both DoCS and DIAC await the outcome of these sentence procedures before making final determinations. The next hearing date in respect of Ms Leoung’s child is to be held at Parramatta Children’s Court on 26 and 27 November.106 Ms Leoung was also assessed by Ms Collins and Ms Armstrong with particular regard to the effect of her imprisonment on her daughter, who in a sense is also being imprisoned within Australia for an indeterminate time. I have no doubt Ms Leoung is very concerned for her daughter’s welfare and that was evidenced from the time of her arrest when she asked the arresting officer what would happen to her if she was in prison (see Exhibit 1).107 I now read from extracts from Ms Collins’ report which was prepared on 12 February 2007. 
     
      
      Background History.  
      Ms Leoung is the middle of three children born to her parents in Phon Pham. She described a good childhood up to the time of her parents separation when she was eight years old. She told me that her childhood declined at that time explaining that she had to work and could not continue on at school. Ms Leoung reports that she only completed two years of formal education up to eight years of age. She explained that she commenced school but she had to leave when her parents divorced and she was required to work. Ms Leoung states that she did not want to leave school at such a young age and regrets not having any formal education. 
       
      Ms Leoung reports that she had consistently maintained work. From age eight she worked cleaning and waitressing and then from fifteen she worked in a lottery office selling tickets. Ms Leoung told me she has maintained a market stall selling costume jewellery for the last four to five years. Ms Leoung advised that she and her husband have been renting a property for the last few years and living independently. 
      
     
     
      
      Relationship History.  
      She described her relationship as positive and she denied any discordance or substance abuse issues. She told me that her husband is very distressed by her incarceration and by their daughter being in care. Ms Leoung reports that she is upset that she has been separated from her daughter, however she did state that she believes her daughter is well looked after in foster care. She said that her daughter appears to be relatively happy during the weekly visits that she has with her. 
      
     
     
      
      Ms Leoung has been advised that her daughter may remain in Australia following her release from gaol and she was concerned that she may not be able to return to Cambodia with her. She did not report any significant mental or physical health problems or any substance abuse history. 
      
     
     
      
      Ms Leoung told me that the offence was motivated by a need for money. She said that a man approached her and advised that she could be given an opportunity to travel overseas if she completed her task. However she reports that this man would tell her what the task entailed until she agreed to participate. Ms Leoung states that once she agreed she was advised that she had to bring something with her but she was never told what the items were. She was concerned that they were likely illicit substances. 
      
     
     
      
      Ms Leoung reports that she could not refuse to participate at that time because her airplane ticket and documentation had been prepared and she had to pay $4,000 back for these which she could not do. Ms Leoung told me that she is angry that she showed poor judgment by becoming involved with this offence and she believes importing drugs to be wrong. 
      
     
     
      
      Clinical Presentation at Interview.  
      No disturbance in thought or language was apparent. Ms Leoung reported some reduction to her mood which she states results from concerns that her daughter will not be able to return to Cambodia with her upon her release. She described good appetite, sleep and energy patterns. Ms Leoung reports a degree of distress further to the possible long term separation from her daughter. This is evidently a worry for her and one that will increase commensurate with her approaching release date. She appears to be hopeful that this possibility may not eventuate given the early stage in these proceedings. 
      
     
     
      
      I do not believe that Ms Leoung’s functioning will necessarily improve given the long term implications associated with a formal separation from her daughter upon her release. 
      
     
     
      
      Psychometric Testing.  
      She achieved a score that places her within the extremely low to border-line range of ability, outperforming the bottom one percent of the normative sample for her age. Ms Leoung’s limited education would have affected her ability to complete these tasks which she struggled to understand. These tasks likely had limited real world meaning to her. 
      
     
     
      
      Family Assessment.  
      As part of the assessment Ms Leoung was observed having a weekly visit with her daughter, who is currently in foster care, for a total of two hours. 
      
     
     
      
      In discussion with DoCS it was stated that her daughter is settling into foster care. Although the DoCS report suggests a tenuous attachment between mother and child, my observation is not entirely consistent with this. It does seem a bond exists between mother and child although it is inevitable that such a bond will be distorted given the unusual situation the mother and child find themselves in. 
      
     
     
      
      Recommendations. 
       Ms Leoung does not report any particular difficulties directly related to her incarceration. She is maintaining work and eating and functioning to a sufficient level. However, she is limited in many of the vocational opportunities she can assess due to her non English speaking background. In terms of Ms Leoung’s relationship with her daughter, a lengthy separation will further destabilise their bond given the already unstable attachment between mother and daughter. Further, her daughter will develop an increasing cultural detachment commensurate with a lengthy absence from her family and cultural background. When considering the ongoing distress Ms Leoung is currently experiencing and likely to continue to experience, she will not be able to access consistent clinical intervention to assist her through this process whilst in gaol, again due to her limited English skills. 
      
    108 I will now deal with the report from Sarah Armstrong, which is dated 9 August 2007. This assessment report predominantly assesses the relationship between Ms Leoung and her child.  
     
      
      Ms Leoung is undoubtedly vulnerable within the correctional centre and is in danger of being isolated and the likely impact on her daughter of separation from her mother. The psychologist assessing the interaction between her daughter and Ms Leoung proposed that it is necessary to be cautious in interpreting the responses an infant may make when their primary attachments are disputed. The reason for removing her daughter from her mother’s care was based entirely on the circumstances of the offence committed and there is no evidence that her daughter was otherwise at risk when in the mother’s care. For the purpose of natural justice to both mother and child the most appropriate course of action must be to make decisions about her dughter’s care needs once the sentencing of her mother has been decided. 
      
     
     
      
      Summary and Recommendations.  
      The care plan stated that her daughter has a healthy attachment to her mother and Ms Leoung is very attentive towards her daughter in providing her basic physical and emotional needs. Ms Leoung shows keen regret for the poor decision she made at the time of the offence and this regret does not centre on concern for her own incarceration but rather the plight of her daughter and the fear that she may permanently be separated from her child. 
      
    109 Recommendations. (1) Application to the mothers and children’s program through the Department of Corrective Services for her daughter to be placed with her mother, Ms Kunthea Leoung, in one of the full-time residential programs ordered within this program for mothers with children under school age.(2) Parental responsibility should be restored to Ms Leoung and a supervision order introduced to ensure her daughter’s safety and progress are monitored.(3) It would be essential for her daughter’s welfare that she have an ongoing close relationship with her mother. For a child of her age such a contact would have to be frequent in order to maintain the attachment, with weekly contact being optimal. Adequate and effective arrangements should be made in order to serve the child’s best interests. (4) Such visits must be closely supervised but the current plan of six visits a year would not be a sufficient frequency to maintain a relationship between such a young child.110 I accept that Ms Leoung was a person of prior good character and with no exposure to the drug milieu. She was unaware of the death penalty for drug importation that applied in Bangkok. She had no appreciation of the effects of drug abuse in society. Like the others she has undertaken to give evidence and her assistance is rated as being of a high value. Her statement reveals a particularly difficult method of secreting the pellets within her body at a stage where she was unable to withdraw because of the money already expended on her behalf. (See Exhibit D). 111 The situation with her child is unusual as far as a similar problem that might occur if she had been an Australian citizen. Ms Leoung speaks Khmer. Kehmawatey is fostered with an Australian family who do not speak Khmer. The child’s first language is therefore likely to be English rather than Khmer, which is going to create a communication problem for mother and child during her imprisonment. But more importantly if her child is returned to her on release the child will be going back into an environment where little or no English will be spoken. That problem exists in addition to the bonding and emotional troubles referred to by Ms Collins and Ms Armstrong. Ms Leoung’s intellectual resources are poor and are unlikely to help the situation and I accept that her background and antecedents in that regard are similar to Mr Chouh, Ms Oum, Ms Yin and Mr Chea. 112 In regard to Mr Chea and Ms Leoung, I make the following orders. 113 Each is convicted. 114 Ms Leoung is sentenced to four years and five months imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and nine months to date from 10 October 2006. She is therefore eligible for release on parole on 9 July 2009. 115 Mr Chea is sentenced to four years and five months imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and eleven months to date from 10 October 2006. He is therefore eligible for release on parole on 9 September 2009. 116 I strongly recommend Ms Leoung be permitted to participate in the mother and children’s program, subject to assessment as to the propriety of that from time to time by the Department of Community Services. I will have something to say at the end of the proceedings in regard to BS about the discount situation but I do not need to go into that at this point of time.117 HIS HONOUR: I’ll make a non-publication order in regard to BS’s matter as well. I’ll make the non-publication order of any names associated with this matter. 118 BS imported 239.2 grams of heroin. She is aged thirty-seven and is married with three children. The youngest, a boy called Vichith Srang now aged two years and five months, accompanied her to Australia. He has also been the subject of an intervention by the Department of Community Services and is currently in foster care. Since her imprisonment she and her child have been diagnosed as HIV positive. 119 Childhood. BS is a Cambodian citizen and was born in the capital Phnom Penh. She has four brothers and two sisters and she is the youngest of seven children. The sentence proceedings did not go into detail as to her childhood per se nor the effects if any of the Pol Pot regime on her as a child. However, what is known is that she described having a conventional childhood, unaffected by various factors such as the political climate and poverty.120 She resided with her husband in Phnom Penh prior to the offence. Her husband was employed and his work involved him travelling to surrounding provinces. She is a mother of three and she was travelling with her 20-month-old son when she was arrested. Her eldest son is aged eighteen and her daughter is aged eleven. BS and her husband and her children resided in an average sized wooden house. The whole family in fact resides in a large family home but the home is divided up into areas and rooms for each family. BS had never left Cambodia and knew very little about Australia. She did not have a previous criminal record and is otherwise of good character. She is currently learning English in custody.121 In respect of her child, the New South Wales Minister for Community Services has been awarded parental responsibility under s 4AAA of the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 and the child is now a ward of the State until aged eighteen. She sees her child twice a week for two hours. She stated that her child cannot speak Khmer but can speak some words in English. She described her child in the sentencing proceedings as dressing like an Australian. She also showed remorse and regret for her actions, stating that she finds it very difficult, “I’m regretful for what I did that caused our separation”.122 Since her arrest BS and her child have been diagnosed as HIV positive. At this time she does not require any medication but does not know if her child is obtaining or in need of HIV medication. She has no hope that she will receive medical treatment for HIV once she is deported back to Cambodia. She is aware that treatment is available in Cambodia, as suggested by evidence presented during the sentence proceedings from the HIV AIDS Legal Centre. However, she does not accept that she will be able to access that treatment as a result of lack of money. 123 BS was assessed by Ms Collins and Ms Armstrong. The histories obtained were confirmed by BS in evidence. I will deal firstly with the report by Emma Collins dated 10 January 2007. 
     
      
      History.  
      She described a conventional childhood, stating that her parents had enough money to support the family. She said that her childhood was not greatly affected by the political difficulties in Cambodia, however, she did state that she spent a few years of her early childhood being cared for away from her family during the Pol Pot regime. She advised that this was normal at that time because of the war and restrictions upon children attending school. 
       
      She denied any learning difficulties, achieving reasonable grades and denied any disciplinary issues. She said that her parents retired to their home village in 1999 and she lives with her siblings on a family owned block of land. She has one floor of the property, which she maintains with her husband and children. Nonetheless, BS described financial hardship in attempting to care for her family and put her children through school. She told me that she and her husband have struggled to provide adequately for their family in spite of maintaining consistent work. 
      
     
     
      
      Relationship History.  
      On my last visit with her BS told me that she has been advised that her son may remain in DoCS’ care until he is eighteen years of age. She was extremely distressed. She said that she wants her son to return home with her once she has completed her sentence period. BS states that her two other children remain with her husband. 
      
     
     
      
      Medical and Clinical History.  
      When I saw BS for the second session she had just found her 20-month-old son had been diagnosed as HIV positive. She was extremely devastated by the news and she is yet to be tested herself.  
      
     
     
      
      Offence.  
      BS said that she did not think through the repercussions. 
      
     
     
      
      Psychometric Testing.  
      BS gained a score that places her within the extremely low to borderline range, outperforming the bottom two per cent of the normative sample for her age. This result probably under represents her true ability level because she gave up on some of the harder tasks easily and she appeared nervous when completing the test. It is likely that BS’s cognitive functioning is not higher than low average given her reported limited educational attainment. She impresses with low intellectual resources. 
      
     
     
      
      Family Assessment.  
      BS was observed on two occasions when having a weekly visit with her twenty-month-old son. In discussions with DoCS it was reported that Vichith had taken a considerable time to settle into his current foster care placement, although he is also described as having attached to his carer well at the present time. On the two visits I observed BS actively sought out her son, playing with him and attempting to maintain his attention for most of the time. He appeared quite emotionless at times. It is likely that his emotional response to his mother is likely to be quite severely affected by the separation. 
      
     
     
      
      The concern is that over time and given his age, alienation from his family of original, including his family in Cambodia, will occur and circumstances will become quite difficult for him. As time continues there will become further problems in the mother son relationship as this is a crucial period up to age five in the bonding and attachment system of a child. Vichith was quiet expressionless and unemotional towards his mother initially but this lessened as the visits progressed. 
      
     
     
      
      There was no verbal interaction between them for the majority of the visits. However, that is considered to be quite culturally common in South East Asian families. In my opinion the separation of Vichith from his mother is having a significant impact upon his emotional and general adjustment. It is perhaps more concerning that he makes no attempt to talk at this present time. The crucial attachment time for children is around the two to five year age period. He will probably experience problems with regards to language and cultural identity. His foster carer is not Cambodian and specific isolation from his family. 
      
    124 Under ‘Summary and Opinion’ Ms Collins says that BS appears very impressionable and that she was always compliant during her visits. 125 I will deal with the Sarah Armstrong report, which is dated 9 August 2007. Under the heading ‘The likely impact on BS of separation from her son Vichith and her two children remaining in Cambodia’, she says that: 
     
      
      BS describes her family of origin as being close and that her marriage is a positive one. She has successfully raised two older children, one of whom was destined to commence university. Mother and son have both been diagnosed with an infectious disease and her knowledge of her son’s condition has exacerbated her level of distress. She is undoubtedly vulnerable within the correctional centre and is in danger of being isolated and without supports. It is unknown to what degree or ongoing health issues will be attended to whilst in custody and this may further impact her fragile coping mechanisms. BS expresses deep regret for the offence she commenced and speaks entirely of the impact of the current circumstances on her three children. Her absence and the lack of income this creates is likely to have a deep impact on her family and the educational prospects of her children there. 
      
     
     
      
      The likely impact on the child of separation from his mother.  
      There would appear to be no evidence he was at risk in his mother’s care prior to the offence being committed. There is no suggestion in the information provided that BS was providing inadequate care for her son. It would seem therefore that the most appropriate course of action would have been to make decisions about his long term care needs once the sentencing of his mother has been decided. 
       
       
      If he remains in foster care, however, his infectious disease will undoubtedly create disadvantages for him in terms of his social adjustment within Australia and will decrease the likelihood of being able to maintain links with his Cambodian culture. Should he return to Cambodia in his mother’s care at the end of her custodial sentence there are indications that his particular health needs will be able to be met in his own country. The Cambodian government is providing significant funding for new paediatric services with a focus of infectious diseases and their impact on paediatric health. There is undoubtedly a decreased chance of finding a suitable placement within Cambodian carers due to his health care needs and he is at risk of isolation due to the inability to place him with young children due to the risk of infection. 
      
     
     
      
      Summary and Recommendations.  
      The care plan indicated there are no options for the child to be restored to his father and that placement with his extended family members in Cambodia could not be recommended. The Department of Community Services do not give evidence that BS should not have her son returned to her care. 
      
    126 It is recommended:(1) That application to the mother and children’s program through the Department of Corrective Services for the child to be placed with his mother should be made.(2) If BS receives a short sentence and one of the following: (a) the above named facilities are unable to offer adequate health service to make this a viable option for the child or his mother or (b) the decision be made to return the child to his mother’s care at the end of BS’s sentence, consideration be given to revising the contact arrangements detailed in the care plan.(3) The child should have frequent visits with his cousin, KR, acknowledging the close bond generally enjoyed by cousins in the Cambodian community.127 BS has undertaken to give evidence and her assistance is rated as of a high value by the Australian Federal Police. She imported a similar amount to Ms Yin 222.9 grams and Ms Oum 228.8 grams. I accept that her intellectual resources are of a similar level to Mr Chouh, Ms Oum, Ms Yin, Mr Chea and Ms Leoung. Her antecedents and background, although difficult, do not appear to be as deprived as theirs, and I accept that she had no previous involvement in drugs. It is perhaps ironic that when she returns to Cambodia with her son, he is likely to get better treatment for any HIV related illness than she is. Indeed if she does require treatment whilst in custody that is probably going to be to her advantage compared to the situation likely to pertain in Cambodia.128 BS is faced with the situation that she has two children with her husband in Cambodia and a child in care in Australia, with no particular surety of having that child returned to her at the end of her sentence. That child because of his HIV status is likely to be additionally disadvantaged in the Australian community for the reasons indicated in the reports. Similar considerations to those applicable to Ms Leoung and her child also apply to BS. It appears that BS’s husband is the person responsible for infecting her and her child. She has had little contact with him because of the difficulties of communication and the fact that she is more concerned about her child and herself, given that he was the cause of their current health problems. She said that she was unable to leave her son with her husband because he had to travel within Cambodia for work and would have been unable to look after him.129 In my view, the hardship suffered by BS and her child in all the circumstances is exceptional, although had they been Australian citizens that would not have been the case. The exceptionality is brought about by the combination of the circumstances of both being found to be HIV positive; of her young child being made a State ward until the age of eighteen; the likely effects of separation at this impressionable time of life where the child will develop a language not his own which will create communication problems with his family and the wider Cambodian community when or if he is returned to Cambodia; where the child, because of his HIV status, is going to have less opportunity within his foster family and the Australian community while resident here; and finally, where there is likely to be a significant disparity of medical treatment between himself and his mother on their return to Cambodia.130 That being said, BS imported the largest amount of heroin of all seven offenders and any penalty needs to reflect that. 131 I have discounted the sentence I imposed by twenty per cent in all cases, except that of Mr Chouh. The sentence that I discounted by twenty per cent was one that I had already discounted for a plea of guilty. I would allocate five per cent of the twenty per cent for past assistance and fifteen per cent of the twenty per cent for future assistance. The sentences I would have imposed but for the assistance in each case was as follows: Mr Srey four years, Mr Chouh five and a half years, Ms Oum six and a half years, Ms Yin six and a half years, Mr Chea five and half years, Ms Leoung five and a half years and BS six and a half years.132 Bearing in mind the matters referred to in my judgment of 25 October 2007 and the above matters I make the following orders in regard to BS. 133 She is convicted. 134 She is sentenced to five years and three months imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and nine months to date from 10 October 2006. She is, therefore, eligible for release on parole on 9 July 2009. 135 Again I strongly recommend that BS be permitted to participate in the mother and children’s program, subject to assessment as to the propriety of that from time to time by the Department of Community Services.136 I’ll order a copy of that judgment be taken out as urgently as possible. I grant liberty to the parties to put the matter back in the list at any stage if there’s any problems associated with any of the sentences. oOo

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY AJA: In April 2006 the Appellant stood trial before Knox DCJ SC and a jury on an indictment which charged him and a co-accused that on 18 January 2004 contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, they, in company with Viliami Taufahema, when the co-accused was armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a pistol, robbed Ante Loveric of approximately $32,900 in cash the property of the King Tomislav Croatian Club Ltd. The appellant and his co-accused pleaded guilty but were convicted by the jury and sentenced to terms of imprisonment.  
     
      
    2 The appellant has appealed against his conviction alleging that prejudicial evidence given inadvertently during the trial caused a miscarriage of justice that requires the Court to quash the conviction and order a new trial.  
     
      
    3 The three men who took part in the robbery were wearing balaclavas and could not be identified by eye witnesses, but Viliami Taufahema, one of the robbers, gave evidence against the co-accused which was corroborated by other evidence. The appellant participated in an ERISP and denied all allegations. He did not give evidence. The robbers used a stolen silver coloured Nissan Skyline as their getaway vehicle. On the afternoon 6 February 2004 police officers attended premises at 9 Berry Street Regents Park and observed a silver coloured Nissan Skyline with no registration plate at the rear of the vehicle in a carport under a car cover. Officers remained nearby while a search warrant was obtained. This was obtained and executed that afternoon. A video recording taken during the execution of the warrant was played to the jury and the tape was marked MFI 16. During the search the police located a number of items apparently belonging to the appellant, including a wallet that contained identification in his name.  
     
      
    4 A police officer was videoed removing items from the wallet which he displayed to the camera and described. One of these items was described as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""An MRRC Temporary Inmate identification card in the name of Chase McMullen"". 
        
       
      
    5 A playing of that part of the tape to the jury is the only irregularity relied upon in the appeal. The relevant part of the tape was played to this Court. The visual and verbal evidence relating to this card lasted about four seconds. The tape was only played once to the jury and it was not available to them in the jury room during their deliberations. They did not ask any questions about the video, or the MRRC card. A transcript of the tape was not in evidence.  
     
      
    6 It was common ground that the initials stand for the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre at Silverwater, and that cards of this type are issued to prisoners serving weekend detention. It was also common ground that there was no other reference in the evidence to MRRC, the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre, or to a temporary inmate and there was nothing to link these to a penal institution at Silverwater. On 6 April 2006, the fourth day of the trial, Viliami Taufahema said in cross-examination that following his arrest in February 2004 he was imprisoned at Silverwater in the remand section.  
     
      
    7 The following day the video tape of the execution of the search warrant was played to the jury during the evidence of Sergeant Forster. The sergeant completed his evidence and was excused. Counsel for the appellant then applied for the discharge of the jury. The judge refused this application, and the trial continued. Legal argument about the significance of the MRRC card and the steps, if any, which the Judge should take to cure any prejudice, followed. A further application for a discharge was made and refused on 10 April and there were further discussions with counsel that day in the absence of the jury.  
     
      
    8 After the Crown closed its case on 11 April the Judge gave directions to the jury in terms that had been discussed with counsel over the preceding days. He said (T 11/4/06 pp48-9): 
     
      
       
        
        ""… you may have heard reference in this trial to people being either in gaol or going to gaol or possibly even having been in gaol or other such places … [his Honour referred to the evidence of Viliami Taufahema who was serving a gaol sentence and continued] but apart from that reference any such references to goal or people being in gaol or maybe even having been in gaol, or either inferences to gaol or other related events and associations they are completely irrelevant to your determination of the innocence and guilt of the accused and of each of them. Our system of criminal justice does not operate on the basis of guilt by association or of past activities or associations … you must put out of your mind and regard as completely and utterly irrelevant any other matters in past times, anything that they or their associates may have been involved in …"" 
        
       
      
    9 The Judge gave a jury a further direction to this effect in his summing up. Referring to the directions that he had given considering the evidence of Mr Viliami Taufahema he continued (s/up p47-8): 
     
      
       
        
        ""but apart from that evidence all other references suggestions or even inferences to gaol or related events or other associations are completely and utterly irrelevant to your determination of the innocence or guilt of the accused, and each of them, because as has been said to you, our system of justice does not operate on the basis of guilt by association or past activities or associations … you must put out of your mind as completely and utterly irrelevant … any other matters in past times that they or any of their associates may have been involved in or in circumstances which they have been in, in the past or involving indeed somebody else's view on what might have happened or what might have not happened."" 
        
       
      
    10 The submission of counsel for the appellant was that the evidence in word and image form in the video which referred to the MMRC card was unfairly prejudicial to the appellant because it revealed, or could have revealed, that he had a criminal record. Counsel further submitted that, although the Judge had given the best directions possible in the circumstances, the defect was incurable.  
     
      
    11 It was common ground that the material about the MRRC card should have been edited out of the tape before it as shown to the jury. The failure to do this was accidental but this would not have mattered if the evidence in fact was unfairly prejudicial. 
     
      
    12 Despite Mr Wetmore's clear and concise argument in support of the appeal I have not been persuaded that the evidence in question was unfairly prejudicial to the appellant. The words and images in themselves were harmless, indeed meaningless, and there was nothing else in the evidence to which they could be connected. They did not tell the jury in terms that the appellant had been convicted of an offence for which he was serving, or had served a sentence of periodic detention. The initials and the words"" Temporary Inmate"" did not identify a penal establishment except to someone with special knowledge.  
     
      
    13 Even if the Court was entitled to speculate that one or more of the jurors might have taken sufficient notice of the card and its description during the four seconds it was visible, and recognised it for what it was, they would not know what type of offence the appellant had committed. Indeed, this Court does not know this either. For example, it could well have been for a traffic offence or an offence connected with an AVO. A knowledgeable juror would also know that periodic detention is reserved for offences of moderate criminality. In these circumstances the appellant has not established that the evidence could reasonably have influenced the jury where the offence charged was one of aggravated robbery. The suggestion that this evidence could have influenced the jury adversely to the appellant involves building speculation upon speculation based on four seconds of evidence about a routine matter given without emphasis. 
     
      
    14 In my judgment the point raised in support of the appeal fails and the Court does not have to consider the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The appeal should be dismissed.  
     
      
    15 HOWIE J: I agree with Handley AJA.  
     
      
    16 PRICE J: I agree.

      12535/07 DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS v Andrew Peter BOLTON 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 ROTHMAN J: Peter Bolton was charged with failing or refusing to undergo a breath test. He was acquitted and the Director of Public Prosecution appeals that acquittal.  
     
      
    Facts 
     
      
    2 Mr Bolton, was at the time of the alleged offence, a Sergeant of Police. He and two other off-duty police officers were in a car, driven by Mr Bolton, when it was stopped by Constables Morgan and Clark. The off-duty police officers had been at a retirement function, with other off-duty police officers, for a former colleague. Mr Bolton hired a taxi from the function at Parramatta to Chatswood, where he had left his car. He intended to drive his own vehicle home. He had, during the night, consumed alcohol.  
     
      
    3 Constables Morgan and Clark stopped the car while Mr Bolton was driving. It was 2.30am. Sergeants Barros and McDougal were the other officers in the car.  
     
      
    4 The learned magistrate found the following: 
     
      
       
      (i) Sergeant Bolton had consumed alcohol during the evening; 
       
       
      (ii) Sergeant Bolton was driving the car; 
       
       
      (iii) The car was stopped by Constables Morgan and Clark who were in a Police vehicle; 
       
       
      (iv) Constables Morgan and Clark stopped their vehicle immediately behind Sergeant Bolton’s car; 
       
       
      (v) Sergeant Bolton, and his two companions, immediately alighted the car; 
       
       
      (vi) Constable Morgan told Sergeant Bolton that “she (Constable Morgan) had pulled him over for the purposes of a random breath test”. 
       
       
      (vii) Constable Morgan also told the driver and passengers that they should get back in the car; but they did not; 
       
       
      (viii) Sergeant Bolton moved a small distance from his two companions; 
       
       
      (ix) The companions had a conversation with the Constables, the terms of which were in dispute, but seemed to include the proposition that there should be a delay in the breath test; 
       
       
      (x) There was an interval of about ten minutes between the stopping of the vehicle and the crucial events during which time there was, it seems, a general discussion, about what should happen in relation to the breath test; 
       
       
      (xi) The crucial events are described a little differently by each of the Constables. Constable Clark said: 
       
       
       
        
        “I then took the alcometer and said to the accused: ‘For this random breath test take a deep breath, blow into the tube and I will tell you when to stop’. I then held the alcometer up to the accused who put his lips on the tube but failed to exhale…. I said to the accused: ‘I will again get you to blow into the tube until I tell you to stop’. As I held the alcometer up to the accused, he turned his head away and refused to provide a sample.” 
        
       
       
      (xii) Senior Constable Meppem, a supervisor who, because of the status of the sergeants had been called for assistance, corroborated that evidence except relevantly in one respect, namely, that the words first spoken by Constable Clark to Sergeant Bolton did not include the words: “For this random breath test”. Further he does not recount the second request.  
       
       
      (xiii) The evidence of Senior Constable Meppem was accepted by the learned Magistrate, and that of Constable Clark and Sergeant Bolton, for very different reasons, was not.  
       
       
      (xiv) Following the refusal of the directions, Sergeant Bolton left the scene by moving up the driveway of an adjacent property, jumping a fence and walking up the next street to reach the Pacific Highway.  
       
      
    Issue and Judgment Below 
     
      
    5 The issue in this appeal is the proper construction of section 13 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Act), which establishes the offence charged and whether, on the findings of fact of the learned Magistrate, the offence was proved.  
     
      
    6 The learned Magistrate determined that the absence of the words “for this random breath test” were crucial and that the administering police officers had failed to establish the necessary preconditions for the offence to be committed.  
     
      
    7 Relying on the judgment of the High Court in Hammond v Lavender (1976) 11 ALR 371, the learned magistrate construed section 13 of the Act so that it required both a requirement to undergo the test and directions for the manner of compliance. He held that, in the converse situation to Hammond v Lavender, here there were directions as to the manner of compliance, but not a requirement to undergo the test. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the present case the position seems to me to be reversed. The manner of compliance was indicated but no requirement made. I am not satisfied at the criminal standard that the additional words that Constable Clark claims that he used, that is the words, ‘for this random breath test’, were used and there is no need to decide whether, if they had been, they would have been sufficient.” 
        
       
      
    8 It is necessary to set out the terms of section 13 of the Act:  
     
      
       
        
        “13(1) A police officer may require a person to undergo a breath test in accordance with the officer’s directions if the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person:  
         
         
          
          (a) is or was driving a motor vehicle on a road or road related area, or  
          
         
         
          
          (b) is or was occupying the driving seat of a motor vehicle on a road or road related area and attempting to put the motor vehicle in motion, or  
          
         
         
          
          c) being the holder of a driver licence, is or was occupying the seat in a motor vehicle next to a holder of a learner licence while the holder of the learner licence is or was driving the vehicle on a road or road related area.  
          
         
         
        (2) A person must not, when required by a police officer to undergo a breath test under subsection (1), refuse or fail to undergo the breath test in accordance with the directions of the officer.  
         
         
        Maximum penalty: 10 penalty units.  
         
         
        (3) It is a defence to a prosecution for an offence under subsection (2) if the defendant satisfies the court that the defendant was unable on medical grounds, at the time the defendant was required to do so, to undergo a breath test.  
         
         
        (3A) Before requiring a person to undergo a breath test under subsection (1), and for the purpose of determining whether to conduct such a test, a police officer may conduct a preliminary assessment to determine if alcohol is present in the person’s breath by requiring the person to talk into a device that indicates the presence of alcohol.  
         
         
        (4) Without limiting any other power or authority, a police officer may, for the purposes of this section, request or signal the driver of a motor vehicle to stop the vehicle.  
         
         
        (5) A person must comply with any request or signal made or given to the person by a police officer under subsection (4).  
         
         
        Maximum penalty: 10 penalty units. 
        ” 
         
         
        
       
      
    The Appeal and Jurisdiction of the Court 
     
      
    9 The decision of the learned Magistrate was delivered on 9 February 2007. The appeal was filed on 22 May 2007 outside the time prescribed by the rules (SCR 57B r.6), namely 28 days, which had expired on 9 March 2007. No submission is made that the delay caused prejudice, unfair or otherwise.  
     
      
    10 The transcript of the proceedings only became available on 2 March 2007. The relevant officer was on duty in Moree at that time. The DPP advised the solicitors for Sergeant Bolton of their intention to appeal. I extend the time for the appeal to a date that includes the date of filing.  
     
      
    11 The DPP rely on section 56(1)(c) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) which provides for an appeal by a prosecutor against the dismissal of a matter but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone. A “question of law” is broader than “a decision on a question of law” (see Hutchinson v RTA [2000] NSWCA 332 at [33]) and wider than “error of law” (see Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v X (2000) 49 NSWLR 653 at [124]).  
     
      
    12 The wording here is that an appeal lies “only on a question of law alone”. This term does not include an error of law in circumstances where the result depends on factors other than the question of law. Thus, a mixed question of fact and law is not able to be appealed under this section, even where the error is one of law; see Williams v R (1986) 161 CLR 278 at 302 (per Mason and Brennan JJ).  
     
      
    13 Nevertheless, the determination that given facts necessarily fit within or outside a statutory description is a question of law, unless those facts may or may not fit the description, depending on the degree or significance of one or more facts: Australian Gaslight Co v Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR (NSW) 126 at 137-138.  
     
      
    14 In the current appeal, the question raised by the DPP is whether on the given facts, being the facts found by the learned magistrate, they necessarily fit within the description in section 13 of the Act and that, therefore, there was an error of law by the learned Magistrate. Such a question is a question of law alone because it depends on the determination of only that question of law. An appeal lies.  
     
      
    Construction of the Legislation 
     
      
    15 The only relevant issue on the construction of the legislation relates to the need to state the purpose of the directions given to undergo the test.  
     
      
    16 Unlike the facts that formed the basis of the judgment in Hammond v Lavender, there is no question here that the police officer gave the directions necessary (assuming all else is satisfied) to ground a refusal or failure. The High Court in Hammond v Lavender made clear that the offence (a very similar provision) was “not made out unless and until the prosecution establishes the making of an appropriate direction by the person authorised to operate the instrument”. (Per Mason J, with whom Barwick CJ, Stephen, Jacobs and Murphy JJ agreed, at ALR 375.5).  
     
      
    17 The offence in the Act is created by section 13(2). The offence is failing to undergo a breath test “when required by a police officer … under sub-section (1)”. In turn, sub-section (1) entitles a police officer to “require a person to undergo a breath test in accordance with the officer’s directions” in certain circumstances. There is no issue that the circumstances were satisfied.  
     
      
    18 The submissions on behalf of Sergeant Bolton are that a police officer administering a breath test must give both a direction that the test be undertaken and directions as to the manner which it is to be taken. It is said that the words “take a deep breath and blow into the tube until I tell you to stop” are ambiguous as they do not disclose a direction to undergo the breath test.  
     
      
    19 For the reasons that now follow, it is unnecessary to determine that issue finally. However, I will deal with it briefly.  
     
      
    20 In order for the learned Magistrate to dismiss the charge he must be unable to form the view that the offence under section 13(2) was proven to the requisite standard.  
     
      
    21 The offence is failing to undergo a breath test in accordance with the officer’s directions. As a matter of fact, on the findings of his Honour, Sergeant Bolton failed to undergo a breath test in accordance with the directions of Constable Clark. Sergeant Bolton was pulled over and told he was pulled over for the purposes of a random breath test. There was a conversation and Sergeant Bolton was given the appropriate directions with which he failed to comply. Having been told that he was pulled over for a random breath test, the directions given could only be for that purpose, and the offence is made out.  
     
      
    22 The question posed would arise only in circumstances, not here suggested, where something occurred in the intervening period between that stating of the purpose and the giving of directions, which negated the stated purpose.  
     
      
    23 The singular, unless there is a contrary intention, imports the plural. The fact that one officer said: “you are pulled over for the purpose of a random breath test” and another said “please blow etc” does not negate the direction.  
     
      
    24 For the offence to be made out, it is unnecessary to use any particular form of words or to follow the section in the Act (Police v Spitzer (2003) 85 SASR 431 at 435; R v Clarke [1969] 2 All ER 1008 at 1010A). Obviously some words would be clearer than others and it is appropriate that there are, on the evidence, words recommended in a Police direction. But the most that is needed is that the defendant be informed of the purpose of the directions and thereafter directed in a manner, which, if followed, would successfully complete the test. The combination of the statement of purpose when stopping the vehicle and the directions on carrying out the test necessarily informed the defendant of sufficient information that, when he failed or refused the direction, rendered him liable for the offence.  
     
      
    25 I turn then to other issues. It was accepted by the DPP and the defendant that the section applies objectively, not subjectively. The state of knowledge of Sergeant Bolton at the time of the alleged offence is irrelevant: see R v Nicholls [1972] 2 All ER 186 at 188.6. If sufficient words are spoken to amount to a requirement to undergo the test (with the possible exception of bad faith), the offence, they accept, has been committed. Because of the agreement between the parties, it is unnecessary to decide the issue. If the parties were wrong on this issue, on the facts in this case, it would not assist the defendant.  
     
      
    26 Lastly, I deal with the issue raised in [18] and [19] infra. There is no question, on the facts found, that a direction was given, the effect of which, if followed, would have led to Sergeant Bolton undergoing a breath test. The learned Magistrate accepted that there had to be a statement to the effect that: “You are required to undergo a breath test”. This is not absolutely clear from the legislation.  
     
      
    27 There must be directions given that, if followed, would result in the breath test being taken: Hammond v Lavender, supra. But the requirement is a requirement “to undergo a breath test in accordance with sub-section (1)”. And sub-section (1) entitles a police officer to “require a person to undergo a breath test in accordance with the officer’s directions”. On one construction, and in my view the preferable one, the giving of the directions is all that is required. Provided that the purpose of the directions (and the result of them, if followed) is the undergoing of a breath test, then the breath test has been required, and a failure or refusal to follow the directions is, if proven to the requisite standard, an offence. Of course, if this latter view is correct, then no different result is necessary in these proceedings and it is unnecessary to come to a final view on the issue.  
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    28 The learned Magistrate erred on the construction of the legislation and the question of law raised by this appeal should succeed. If there exists a residual discretion not to grant orders remedying the error, I would not exercise it.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This case is both appalling and baffling. The offender, DN, is a twenty-four year old man with no criminal history. On 9 July 2006, for no fathomable reason, he attacked his partner and her eleven year old son with a knife. She survived but the boy died.  
     
      
    2 He pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the murder of the boy, R, and to causing grievous bodily harm to his partner, SC with intent to murder her. He now stands for sentence, having maintained those pleas of guilty in this Court. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 The facts are not in dispute. They are to be found in an agreed statement of facts and a lengthy statement to police by Ms C. The offences occurred at a house at Callala Bay, on the south coast of New South Wales, where the offender was living with Ms C, R and their one year old child, K. He and Ms C are K’s biological parents, but R was the child of a former relationship of Ms C. 
     
      
    4 The offender and Ms C had been together for about four years. He was a heavy drinker and smoked marijuana regularly. However, their relationship appears basically to have been a good one. When he had been drinking they would argue, among other things, about money. The arguments were sometimes heated but he was never violent. He appears also to have had a good relationship with young R.  
     
      
    5 From early in 2006, Ms C observed that his drinking and use of marijuana increased. She described him as being “very anti-social”, tending to withdraw to his bedroom when visitors arrived at the house. In her statement she recounted an incident sometime after Christmas 2005 in which he behaved strangely while he was drunk, and said something which suggested that he intended to commit suicide. She said that this was the only time he had “gone off the deep end…”. After that incident, however, he appeared normal and they never spoke of it.  
     
      
    6 Also in 2006, she observed him to be depressed. She said that on some days “he just seemed to be down and you knew not to try to talk to him”. A few days before the fateful day, 9 July 2006, he asked her if she thought he needed help for his depression. When she asked him why, he said that he did not want to do anything silly to himself. She replied, “Well, there’s your answer…. You’ve got to be here for [K].” Unfortunately, he did not seek the help he may well have needed.  
     
      
    7 All that said, she could offer no explanation for the extraordinary events which bring him before this Court. On the day before the incident, 8 July, they had celebrated R’s birthday. Throughout the day and into the evening of 9 July, a Sunday, nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary. The offender was drinking spirits, but he was not smoking because he had run out of marijuana. They did not argue, and he did not demonstrate any feeling of malice towards her or R. Ms C said in her statement that by the evening he was “fairly drunk” but he still seemed “just normal…”. 
     
      
    8 At some stage they lay down together on a mattress in their bedroom. It seems that Ms C nodded off to sleep, because she has no memory of the offender getting up or leaving the room. Her next memory is seeing him entering the room, holding a knife. He stabbed her face, the point of the knife penetrating her cheek and entering her mouth, and also piercing her tongue. She heard him say, “Time to die, bitch”. She struggled, and was stabbed several more times in the head and facial area. He kept saying, “It’s time to die, just give up. It’s time to go”. His voice was not raised and to her he sounded “really calm”.  
     
      
    9 Eventually he got up and left the room. She found her mobile phone, dialled 000 and reported that she had been stabbed. He came back to the room, took the phone from her and left again, calling out, “Just go to sleep”. She did not see or hear him again. It was not until later at hospital that she found out what had happened to R.  
     
      
    10 Her call to the 000 service was received at 11.24 pm. Three minutes later a call was received from the offender. He told them where he was and said, “My fucking arsehole bitch”. He then said that he had killed some people. Asked how many, he said, “Two.” He then said, “Get your arse here now please. That’s all I’m going to say.”  
     
      
    11 Police and ambulance officers attended the house. They found Ms C in the bedroom. She was treated at the scene and then conveyed to Shoalhaven District Hospital, where she underwent surgery. In another bedroom they found R. He had two puncture wounds to the neck, his eyes were open but he was unresponsive. CPR did not revive him and he also was taken to the hospital. In yet another bedroom K was found, fortunately unharmed.  
     
      
    12 In Ms C’s bedroom police also observed the word “Satan” written in blood on the wall above the bed. Subsequent fingerprint analysis confirmed that it was the offender who had done this. A blood stained knife was located on the bathroom floor, and forensic biological analysis later established that it had been used to attack both Ms C and R. 
     
      
    13 The offender was located in the carpark of a shopping centre at Callala Bay. Police who approached him saw that he had a large amount of blood on his t-shirt and on his face. He identified himself to them as “Pimp Deano”. He said, “…You’re not going to believe it. You think I’m bad, wait till you see them… I’ve just been stabbed in the head but I fixed those fuckers.” Police observed that he had lacerations to the middle finger of his left hand and the palm of his right hand. He appeared to be intoxicated. He was arrested and conveyed in a police truck to Nowra Police Station. During the journey he was heard to say, “I just killed them fuckers.”  
     
      
    14 R had lost a massive amount of blood. He was taken to an operating theatre, where an attempt was made to stem the bleeding by applying clamps. However, there was no evidence of ongoing successful cardiac function, and his life was pronounced extinct a little after 1 am on Monday, 10 July. Apart from the two puncture wounds to the neck, a number of abrasions were observed on his scalp. At autopsy, the direct cause of death was reported to be “multiple stab wounds to the head and neck”.  
     
      
    15 Ms C’s surgery was for the purpose of repairing multiple facial and left sided head lacerations, together with a laceration on the right side of her tongue and lip. The surgeon, Dr Martin Jones, noted her injuries in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        Lacerations to right side of tongue, full thickness right side lower lip, left cheek starting from level of lateral canthus and deep injury down onto mandible and into submental tissues. Multiple full thickness scalp lacerations from 3 mm to 5 cm in length, some with deep sheer up to 6 cm. Few small superficial wounds to right hand on dorsum of fingers and left hand on palmer surface of fingers. 
        
       
       
      She is likely to require further surgery because of “facial nerve palsy”.  
       
       
      Victim impact statements 
       
      
    16 I received victim impact statements by Ms C and by her parents. Those statements express eloquently their outrage and their grief at the loss of R, and the enduring effects of his senseless and untimely death upon their lives. Their pain is exacerbated by the fact that they remain at a loss to understand why the offender acted as he did. Sadly, SC went so far as to express guilt that she had brought him into R’s life and had failed to protect the boy as a parent should. I cannot imagine how she could possibly have foreseen that the offender might harm him, and I am sure that no right thinking member of this community would suggest that she was in any way to blame.  
     
      
    17 Her mother also expressed concern that she and her husband had not seen “any problems” in the offender’s relationship with R and had not been able to prevent what occurred. They, of course, are equally blameless. It is a testament to her generosity of spirit that she was able to add in her statement: 
     
      
       
        
        I am sure that the [N] family is suffering in the same way. No doubt they have as many questions as my family do. 
        
       
       
      I have regard to these statements in accordance with established authority. It needs hardly be said that the mother and the grandparents of R have my deepest sympathy.  
       
      
    18 SC’s statement goes on to deal with the offender’s attack upon her and its lasting effects, physical and psychological. She has permanent scarring to her face and, as a result of the defensive wounds, to her hands. She suffers palsy to the left side of her face. She lacks feeling in her mouth and is unable to control it. She cannot smile and her speech has been slightly impeded. This has affected her self-esteem. In addition, she suffers from headaches and anxiety attacks. 
     
      
    19 She maintains regular contact with her general practitioner and has consulted a plastic surgeon about her facial damage. Whether further surgery should be undertaken remains to be seen. She has physiotherapy to help with the movement of her face, neck and shoulders. She also attends counselling on a regular basis.  
     
      
       
      Why? 
       
      
    20 I accept that the offender himself is unable to explain his violent behaviour and, indeed, that he has no memory of it. That was his account to Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, who interviewed him in custody a few weeks after his arrest and again in March of this year. It is also what he wrote in letters to Ms C in August 2006, and what he said in evidence before me.  
     
      
    21 He has consistently maintained a gap in memory between watching a country music program on the television at home and later finding himself at the police station. He has no memory of attacking Ms C or R. Nor does he remember ringing the 000 service or behaving as he did when confronted by police in the shopping centre carpark. He recalls drinking heavily but not having smoked marijuana for several days. Unlike Ms C, he remembers that they had an argument, although he could not say how it started or what it was about.  
     
      
    22 To Dr Nielssen he denied any satanic interest, saying that he was not religious. He had tattoos on his body of a religious nature, some of which apparently had a satanic theme, but he said that they had no particular significance to him.  
     
      
    23 Dr Nielssen provided three reports, carefully analysing the history he had obtained from the offender and from other material supplied to him by the offender’s solicitor. That history conveyed to him a longstanding pattern of abuse of marijuana and alcohol, including many amnestic episodes or “blackouts”. The offender told him that his drinking was such that he became “a train wreck” and that, since he had become sober while in custody, he could see the extent of the damage it had caused him. Dr Nielssen thought it likely that he had been acutely intoxicated at the time of the offences, noting that his lack of memory of them was consistent with an alcoholic blackout.  
     
      
    24 The offender also told Dr Nielssen that he tended to become very “cranky and edgy” when he was unable to obtain marijuana, and that he dealt with the withdrawal symptoms by drinking heavily. In addition, Dr Nielssen concluded from the whole of the material that he was suffering a major depressive illness prior to the offences. In his final report, the doctor wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        From the information available to me and the findings from two interviews of Mr [N] I am not able to offer any further advice to the court to explain Mr [N]’s uncharacteristic violence. As far as I can tell Mr [N]’s behaviour was due to a combination of the effects of his personality traits, chronic depression, the effects of chronic cannabis use and cannabis withdrawal, the effects of the rapid consumption of alcohol and something about the circumstances of the evening that appears to have triggered a violent rage. 
        
       
      
    25 The agreed facts record that at about 5pm on the day after the offender’s arrest, 10 July, a blood sample was taken from him. Later analysis of that sample did not detect alcohol but did detect Delta-9-THC acid. In the absence of pharmacological evidence, it could not be said that that finding is inconsistent with his account, supported by Ms C’s statement, that on 9 July he had been drinking heavily but had not smoked marijuana.  
     
      
    26 Notwithstanding his lack of any relevant memory, the offender has accepted responsibility for his crimes. So much is apparent from his early pleas of guilty. Moreover, it is clear that he is deeply remorseful. He expressed his contrition in no uncertain terms in the letters to Ms C to which I have referred. Among other things, he wrote, “I could not ever express the hate I have in myself for what has happened, for taking young [R]’s life”. Throughout the letters he flagellated himself for his behaviour, sometimes in lurid terms. He expressed his regret for what he had done to Ms C herself, not only by his attack on the night in question but also through his abuse of alcohol and drugs over the period they had been together. Generally, he wrote that he deserved “the full punishment that’s to come”.  
     
      
    27 He repeated those sentiments in evidence, apologising to SC’s family and, in particular, to SC. He said, “No words can describe how sorry I am ….” He also said that what he had done was “absolutely wrong”, and added, “There is no time in gaol that could make up for what I’ve done. I accept punishment. That’s what I deserve.” Such is his shame that for a significant period of time he would not allow his own family to visit him in custody.  
     
      
    28 His remorse was also demonstrated by his demeanour in court. The victim impact statements of Ms C and her mother were read to the court by a member of a victim support group who had been assisting the family. Her father read his own statement to the court. During those readings the offender was weeping and was obviously distressed. When he gave evidence he presented as a shattered man. He spoke quietly, but I observed him to be shaking and to become more and more distressed as the evidence progressed.  
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    29 Some explanation of the offender’s drug and alcohol abuse and, perhaps, his propensity for depression is to be found in his background. He is an Aboriginal man, born in Dubbo. He has two older brothers. The family moved to the south coast when he was about five. It seems that both his parents were problem drinkers, and his mother was given to anxiety and depression. There were regularly incidents of domestic violence, including one in which his father broke one of his mother’s ribs. Their relationship deteriorated over a long period and they separated towards the mid-1990s, when the offender was about eleven.  
     
      
    30 He maintained a close bond with his mother. He enjoyed music and learned to play the guitar. He had friends but tended to be something of a “home body”. He left school during Year 10. He is an obese man and was heavy as a child. He was teased at school because of his weight. His early years of high school were in the aftermath of his parents’ separation. His mother had to work at night and, as she had had little education herself, she could not help him with his schoolwork. It was at this time that he started using marijuana, which was readily available at school. He began drinking in his mid-teens.  
     
      
    31 After leaving school, he had some casual employment in the Nowra area, including some work on the CDEP scheme. He pursued his interest in music and became the member of a band. I received several references, including one from a CDEP supervisor, which portray him as a polite young man and a reliable worker. It appears that he has long lacked self-confidence because of his weight, and that he is introverted and has had difficulty in expressing his feelings to others. Importantly, it emerges from the whole of the material, including the references, that he has never been known to be violent or aggressive.  
     
      
    32 As I have said, on his own account and that of Ms C, he had had a good relationship with R. The boy had ADD and he told Dr Nielssen that sometimes he was “a bit of a handful”, but there is nothing to suggest that he dealt with that problem violently or in any way inappropriately. It is clear that he is devoted to the little child, K. So much is apparent from Ms C’s statement and from another letter which he wrote in prison. Since being in custody he has undertaken a number of TAFE courses and he aims to complete his secondary education.  
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    33 I have found this a most difficult sentencing exercise. The offender must be sentenced for two very serious crimes. The murder of R carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of twenty years. The attempted murder of Ms C carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for twenty-five years and a standard non-parole period of ten years.  
     
      
    34 In all the circumstances, the murder of R does not call for the maximum sentence. The Crown prosecutor, very properly, did not suggest that it did. Nevertheless, it is a most serious crime, ameliorated only by the fact that, in all probability, the poor boy was unaware of what was happening to him. It is most likely, and was accepted by the Crown prosecutor, that he was asleep when he was attacked and never regained consciousness. The attempted murder of Ms C is also a serious crime of its kind, and its enduring effects upon her are obvious from the evidence.  
     
      
    35 The offences are the product of an entirely uncharacteristic outburst of violence by the offender. Such light as can be cast upon his behaviour emerges only from Dr Nielssen’s reports. His depression, his intoxication and his withdrawal from cannabis provide some explanation for the level of his violence, but what triggered it remains a mystery. This, of course, is the most disturbing feature of the case and it raises the question whether the offender remains a danger to the community, requiring particular emphasis to be given to the protection of society in determining the appropriate sentences.  
     
      
    36 Dr Nielssen expressed a view about that matter also in his final report. He found no evidence of brain injury or psychotic illness, and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        With regards to his prospects of rehabilitation, it is difficult to make predictions far into the future. However, Mr [N]’s behaviour was in part due to depression and substance abuse which are conditions that are amenable to treatment. He did not report any criminal activity apart from drug abuse and he did not reveal any antisocial attitudes during the interview. He did express a high level of remorse and self-loathing, which were consistent with the presence of depression. He was thought to carry a significant risk of suicide. 
        
       
       
        
        I believe he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation provided he receives appropriate treatment and counselling. 
        
       
      
    37 I have given this matter careful consideration and have concluded that the offender should not be seen as posing a continuing threat to society. I am fortified in that view by the opinion of Dr Nielssen, a most experienced forensic practitioner. The offender is a man of prior good character with no criminal record and no history of violence. He has acknowledged his responsibility for the crimes from the outset, has pleaded guilty and has demonstrated his remorse. He has insight into the gravity of the offences, and has not attempted to put forward anything by way of excuse for them. The depression and substance abuse which appear to have contributed to his behaviour are able to be treated. 
     
      
    38 He needs to undergo that treatment in custody and, if necessary, upon his eventual release. It appears that he has re-established contact with his family and has their support. All in all, I think that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. Of course, he is entitled to rely upon his previous good character, his pleas of guilty and his remorse in mitigation of sentence. His pleas of guilty should be recognised for their utilitarian value, which is considerable, quite apart from their demonstration of his contrition.  
     
      
    39 I have taken into account the aggravating and mitigating factors under s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which are applicable to the case. They are apparent from what I have already said, and there is no need to recite them. The standard non-parole period for each offence is the period which should be set for a crime falling within the mid range of objective seriousness unless there are reasons for departing from it. Neither the Crown prosecutor nor Mr Haesler SC, for the offender, made any submission about where these offences fall within the scale of objective gravity. That is not an easy matter to decide, given that the circumstances in which they were committed are unknown. Nor is it easy to determine the significance of the offender’s depressive illness for this purpose, but some weight must be given to it as a factor contributing to his criminal behaviour.  
     
      
    40 However, the fact remains that he snuffed out the life of a defenceless child. It must be accepted that the child did not suffer, in that he was not conscious at any relevant time. Nevertheless, I would place the murder somewhat above the mid range of objective seriousness, although falling well short of a worst case. I would reach the same conclusion about the attempted murder of Ms C, in the light of her description of what must have been a terrifying experience and of its serious effects upon her.  
     
      
    41 However, there is force in Mr Haesler’s submission that the offender’s pleas of guilty and his subjective case provide ample reason for departing from the standard non-parole periods. The Crown prosecutor, again very properly, did not submit the contrary. I accept, nevertheless, that those periods take their place in the sentencing process as guideposts or reference points. 
     
      
    42 Although I think it unlikely that the offender would commit another offence of violence, it is necessary that the sentences which I pass reflect the need for general deterrence. That factor is reduced somewhat because of his depressive illness, to which I think his abuse of alcohol and drugs was linked at the relevant time. There is a long and familiar line of authority that there is less need for general deterrence in sentencing a person whose culpability for a crime is mitigated by mental illness. Such a person is not a suitable vehicle for severe punishment as an example to others. That said, the extent to which the offender’s mental illness contributed to his crimes is far from clear and it cannot afford him any marked degree of leniency.  
     
      
    43 Although the two offences arose from the same incident, they are distinct and serious crimes. There must be substantial, although not complete, accumulation of the sentences. I would reduce each sentence by twenty percent to reflect the utilitarian value of the offender’s pleas of guilty. But for those pleas, I would have sentenced him to imprisonment for twenty-five years for the murder and fifteen years for the attempted murder. In recognition of his pleas, those sentences will be twenty years and twelve years respectively.  
     
      
    44 Mr Haesler submitted that I should find special circumstances and reduce the non-parole periods below the statutory ratio, even though the application of that ratio to the heavy sentences which I must impose would still leave a lengthy period of parole eligibility. It is obviously in the community’s interest that the offender have the opportunity for release into society for a long period, subject to supervision and the sanction of parole, to foster his rehabilitation. However, in my view, that would be achieved by the application of the statutory ratio. Furthermore, the non-parole period for each offence must be sufficient to mark its gravity. 
     
      
    45 I must structure the sentences with an eye to their total effect, and in such a way as to reflect his overall criminality. The aggregate sentence must meet the competing requirements of denunciation and rehabilitation. The sentence which I have arrived at will involve an effective non-parole period greater than the statutory proportion, but I trust that it will serve both those ends. 
     
      
    46 The sentence for the attempted murder, which I shall pass first, will be imprisonment for twelve years with a non-parole period of eight years. The sentence for the murder, which will commence five years later, will be imprisonment for twenty years with a non-parole period of fifteen years. The aggregate sentence, then, will be twenty-five years with an effective non-parole period of twenty years. It will commence on the date he was taken into custody, 9 July 2006, and he will be eligible for release on parole on 8 July 2026. 
     
      
    47 [DN], for the offence of causing grievous bodily harm to SC with intent to murder her you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of eight years, commencing on 9 July 2006 and expiring on 8 July 2014, and a balance of term of four years, commencing on 9 July 2014 and expiring on 8 July 2018. For the murder of R you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of fifteen years, commencing on 9 July 2011 and expiring on 8 July 2026, and a balance of term of five years, commencing on 9 July 2026 and expiring on 8 July 2031.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE  
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 15 August 2007 Hoang Quang Lu was arraigned on an indictment which contained a single count that he on 1 October 2005 did murder Phillip Anthony Rousianos. After entering a plea of not guilty to murder, the prisoner entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter. The Crown accepted the plea in full discharge of the indictment for the offence of murder. 
     
      
    2 The maximum sentence for the crime of manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 A statement of agreed facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing on 18 October 2007 by consent and marked as exhibit B.  
     
      
       
      The Agreed Facts  
       
      
    4 The agreed facts are: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. About one month before 01 October 2005, in the very early  
         
          
          hours of the morning, Phillip Anthony Rousianos (the deceased) and his girlfriend, Naomi Malcolm, drove over to the nearby premises of the offender, Hoang Quang Lu, at 3 Goulburn Street, Liverpool. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Naomi Malcolm knocked at the door. The offender’s girlfriend, Helena Hudson came to the door. There was an argument between the two women. Naomi Malcolm wanted Helena Hudson to wake up the offender so she could talk to him directly. Helena Hudson refused. There was a verbal exchange.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Naomi Malcolm returned to the car. Helena Hudson followed her out of the house. Helena Hudson remonstrated with Naomi Malcolm.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A physical confrontation followed. The deceased got out of the car, and punched Helena Hudson. The offender emerged from the house. There was a further physical confrontation, between the offender and the deceased, in which the offender was punched and kicked whilst on the ground, by the deceased. The offender’s girlfriend, Helena Hudson, had to intervene to stop the deceased from kicking the offender.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          This was happening around the car in which the deceased and Naomi Malcolm had arrived. In the commotion, the car rolled backwards, and over Naomi Malcolm, and injured her.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The deceased and his girlfriend then left and returned home to the address of the deceased, a unit in nearby Hart Street.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A few minutes later, the offender arrived, in his car, wielding a machete. There were screams and yelling. The offender confronted the deceased, raising the machete at him. At that point the deceased’s father, and his younger brother Danny, intervened. The offender backed off, making death threats at the deceased, and left.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. On Saturday 01 October 2005 at approximately midday, the deceased and his younger brother Danny, who was 15 at the time, and their mother Sophie Rousinaos, left their home in Hart Street, Liverpool, to walk to the Westfield shopping centre, which was a short distance away. At the time the family car was at the workshop being repaired.  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The three walked west along Lachlan Street. Danny Rousianos saw the offender in his car, driving towards them, that is to say east, in Lachlan Street. The offender was alone in the car. The offender saw the deceased and his two companions. He slowed down and turned left into a side-street. Danny Rousianos said to the deceased  
          “Phil, there’s Wayne, driving past” 
          . The offender was also known as Wayne.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        3. The offender returned to his premises at 3 Goulburn Street, Liverpool, where alleged co-offender Dinh Khuong Pham was at the time. The offender collected Pham, and the two left in the offender’s vehicle.  
        
       
       
        
        4. In the car the offender told Pham that the deceased had had a fight with the offender and that he (the deceased) had hit his wife. The two agreed to drive to where the offender had last seen the deceased and to attack the deceased and assault him and occasion actual bodily harm to him. 
        
       
      
     5. At the time, the offender had an iron bar in his vehicle.  
     
      
       
        
        6. The offender stopped his vehicle in Lachlan Street just behind where the deceased and his mother and brother were walking. The offender and Pham jumped out of the vehicle, the offender holding the iron bar, and began yelling at the deceased and chasing him.  
        
       
       
        
        7. As the co-offender Pham ran after the deceased, the deceased’s mother, Sophie Rousianos stood in Pham’s path. Pham struck Sophie Rousianos in the face, knocking her to the ground. The deceased jumped over the fence of the property at 10 George Street Liverpool, at the corner of Lachlan and George Streets, and ran to the front door of the house.  
        
       
       
        
        8. Pham returned to the offender’s vehicle and retrieved an object from within the vehicle while the offender stood at the side fence of 10 George Street, yelling at the deceased and waving the iron bar at him. At the time, the deceased was at the front door, knocking for help.  
        
       
       
        
        9. The offender, together with Pham then jumped over the fence into the property at 10 George Street and surrounded the deceased on the porch near the front door to the premises.  
        
       
       
        
        10, The deceased kicked at the offender and the offender punched the deceased in the face.  
        
       
       
        
        11. It is agreed between the parties that during the confrontation on the porch at the front door of the premises that Pham produced a knife and fatally stabbed the deceased.  
        
       
       
        
        12. The acts of the offender as set out in the above paragraphs 3-10 constitute an unlawful and dangerous act which substantially contributed to the death of the deceased.  
        
       
       
        
        13. After the deceased had been stabbed on the front porch, he walked slowly from the porch to the front gate of the premises and collapsed to his knees. An ambulance crew attended within minutes and conveyed him to Liverpool Hospital where he was pronounced life extinct at 12.59pm. A post mortem examination showed that a blade of a knife had penetrated the full thickness of the right ventricle of the heart, the right main chamber of the heart. The total penetration of the blade was 10cm. The cause of death was given as a stab wound to the chest.  
        
       
       
        
        14. The offender whilst reporting to Liverpool Police Station at about 5pm that afternoon was arrested by investigating officers. He agreed to participate in an ERISP interview, where he denied the offence of murder. He was subsequently charged.” 
        
       
      
    5 I make findings of fact for the purpose of sentencing the prisoner in accordance with the agreed facts.  
     
      
    6 Paragraphs 3-10 of the agreed facts disclose the acts of the prisoner which substantially contributed to the death of the deceased. The prisoner’s offending did not involve an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased or reckless indifference to human life. There is no suggestion that he knew that Pham was in possession of a knife, which Pham would use.  
     
      
    7 The prisoner intended that he and Pham would assault the deceased and occasion actual bodily harm to him. He was motivated by the desire for revenge for what had occurred about a month before when the deceased had punched his girlfriend and had punched and kicked him whilst he was on the ground. It was for this purpose that he had left the motor vehicle holding an iron bar and chased the deceased. It was Pham, however, who produced a knife and inflicted the stab wound from which the deceased died. 
     
      
    8 The starting point in the present sentencing exercise as in all offences of manslaughter is that the life of Phillip Rousianos aged 21 years has been unlawfully taken: see R v Blacklidge (unrep, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). 
     
      
    9 The death would not have occurred but for the fact that the prisoner picked up Pham and returned with him to George Street to find the deceased. The prisoner’s animosity towards the deceased provided the reason for the agreement with Pham to inflict actual bodily harm. He procured the assistance of Pham in his dispute with the deceased so as to avenge himself and his girlfriend. It was the prisoner who created the circumstances of confrontation in which the deceased unexpectedly found himself. The prisoner as I have said did not know that Pham was in possession of a knife. The acts of the prisoner, which constitute an unlawful and dangerous act, which substantially contributed to the death of the deceased, include the threat of violence to him. The prisoner was armed with an iron bar, which he waved at the deceased whilst he stood at the side fence. At that time, the deceased was seeking help. The prisoner and Pham then jumped over the fence and surrounded him. The prisoner used actual violence when he punched the deceased in the face. Whilst the deceased kicked at the prisoner, he only did so after they had pursued and surrounded him on the porch. 
     
      
    10 This is to my mind an objectively serious offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act.  
     
      
    11 Mr Button SC submits (POS 11) that the prisoner’s use and selling of prohibited drugs was the real cause of the “festering dispute” with the deceased which precluded him from reporting to police that he and his girlfriend had been assaulted. There is no dispute that the confrontation at the prisoner’s home about a month before the deceased’s death occurred as the deceased had gone there to obtain prohibited drugs. It seems to me that it would be a peculiar result that an inability to report a matter to police because of personal involvement in criminal activity could be considered to be a matter of mitigation. Neither the prisoner’s involvement in criminal activity nor the assault upon him and his girlfriend a month before can justify the prisoner taking the law into his own hands and seeking to exact physical revenge: see R v Buddle [2005] NSWCCA 82 per Wood CJ at CL at [11]. The prisoner had confronted the deceased in Hart Street shortly following the assault. The month that had elapsed afforded him the opportunity for calm reflection and to appreciate that violent avengement was wrong. 
     
      
    12 The prisoner has a lengthy criminal history which commenced in 1990 and includes convictions for offences of dishonesty, the possession and supply of prohibited drugs, assault and possession of a prohibited weapon. Other than the offence of assault in 1990 for which he was convicted and fined, there is one offence involving violence, namely the offence of robbery in company for which he was convicted and sentenced in the Campbelltown District Court in September 2000 to a total term of imprisonment of 32 months with a non-parole period of 16 months. Conditions of his release to parole included drug and alcohol counselling. In March 2003 the prisoner was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for the supply of a prohibited drug, which was suspended on appeal and he came under the jurisdiction of the Drug Court. It appears from the probation and parole report (exhibit 2) that he voluntarily removed himself from the program and was sentenced to a 50 hour community service order by the Drug Court in April 2004 which he failed to complete. Upon revocation of the order on 20 June 2005, the prisoner was sentenced to imprisonment for four months, the term of imprisonment being suspended upon his entering into a s12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ( Crimes (SP) Act) bond one of the conditions of which was that he was to continue his methadone maintenance program. On 26 May 2006 for the offence of supply of a prohibited drug he was sentenced in the Campbelltown District Court to a total term of imprisonment of 4 years 8 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 7 months. The sentence and non-parole period commenced on 2 November 2005 and the non-parole period expires on 1 June 2009.  
     
      
    13 That criminal history deprives the prisoner of the considerations of leniency to which he may have been entitled if the current offence was an isolated act of criminality. Having regard to the prisoner’s criminal history, I give more weight to considerations of personal deterrence and the protection of the community than otherwise would be the case: see R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; R v M.A.K, R v M.S.K [2006] NSWCCA 381.  
     
      
    14 An aggravating factor is at the time of the offence the prisoner was subject to the s 12 bond which he had entered into on 20 June 2005 and was also on conditional bail for the charge of supply prohibited drug for which he was sentenced in the District Court on 26 May 2006. Bail had been granted in the Liverpool Local Court on 12 March 2005 and included a reporting condition. The prisoner abused his conditional liberty by committing the crime of manslaughter. The commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty has long been regarded as a factor of aggravation requiring the passing of a deterrent sentence: see for example Regina v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at [40-42] and R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 at [48].  
     
      
    15 The Crown invites me to find that an aggravating factor was that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity: s 21A(2)(n) Crimes (SP) Act. In the present case, the stabbing of the deceased was not planned. The prisoner did not know that Pham had a knife. He had by chance seen the deceased walking along Lachlan Street and had returned to his home where Pham by chance happened to be. Whilst driving back to Lachlan Street, they agreed to assault and occasion actual bodily harm to the deceased. The existence of planning in this offence is limited to that agreement which in my view does not meet the description in s 21A(2)(n). The planning which I have described is a factor which I have taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    16 An aggravating factor, the Crown contends, is that the offence was committed without regard for public safety: s 21A(2)(i) Crimes (SP) Act. It appears to me that an inherent characteristic of an offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act is that it is committed without regard for public safety. The lack of regard for public safety in this case was not such that it transcends the inherent characteristics of the offence: see R v Elyard [2006] NSWCCA 43 per Howie J at [43]. Although the attack upon the deceased occurred in broad daylight at about midday on a Saturday the prisoner remained focussed on the deceased and pursued him to the front door of the home. The circumstances of the commission of the present offence are not such that they meet the description in s 21A (2)(i) Crimes (SP) Act.  
     
      
    17 The prisoner, I am informed, was born in South Vietnam on 20 July 1973 and is 34 years of age. He was 32 years old at the time of the manslaughter. As the prisoner did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence, his subjective circumstances are taken from the histories given in a pre-sentence report (exhibit 2) and the report of Tim Watson-Munro, psychologist (exhibit 3). It appears that he is the eldest in a family of three children. The family fled Vietnam by boat when the prisoner was aged nine. During that journey, the boat capsized and the prisoner’s uncle and his younger brother aged 7 drowned. After a three-day search, the body of his brother was discovered. Mr Watson-Munro relates that arising from this, a range of distressing symptoms, which ultimately developed into a post-traumatic stress disorder were experienced by the prisoner. Following a period of nine months in a camp in Thailand, the family migrated to Perth. He attended primary school in Adelaide and then at Campsie. He found it very difficult to adjust to life in Australia and experienced a strong sense of isolation. Whilst in secondary school, he described frequent humiliation and bullying by his peers. He left school in year 9 and worked in various jobs, his last one being in a bakery where he worked for four years. According to Mr Watson-Munro this was his last job and as a consequence of his escalating drug addiction and periods of incarceration, the prisoner has not worked since 1992. The prisoner was married in 1992 but separated in 1998. They have a 15 year-old son with whom the prisoner speaks on a weekly basis. He began smoking marijuana and abusing alcohol at the age of 15. At the age of 21 he started using heroin, initially smoking the drug before progressing to intravenous use. The prisoner claims, Mr Watson-Munro recites, that at the time of the present offence he was using heroin, cannabis and alcohol at a high level of intensity. Mr Watson-Munro opines that in part he was abusing drugs and alcohol as a means of self-medication against his escalating post-traumatic stress disorder. It would appear, Mr Watson-Munro states, that the prisoner has had limited treatment for his condition. The prisoner informed him that he was placed on a methadone program in 1996, which continued for 12 months and he attempted treatment again in 1998 but discontinued after nine months.  
     
      
    18 Mr Watson-Munro opines that there is a direct nexus between his significant criminal history and his complex development history, characterised by an extensive addiction to drugs in the context of him experiencing a protracted and unresolved post-traumatic stress disorder. He considers that the addiction has significantly impacted upon the prisoner’s capacity to cope with life and it would appear, he states, that a vicious cycle has developed with the prisoner’s medication tending to exacerbate his underlying problems. He reports that the prisoner has now been drug-free for an extensive period and has developed some insight to his problems and significantly appears to be experiencing profound regret for his actions. The prisoner, Mr Watson-Munro observes, remains symptomatic particularly in relation to his symptoms of depression, anxiety and the regular flashbacks which he experiences. Despite this, Mr Watson-Munro states, to his credit he has avoided all drug use and a prior penchant for gambling since being gaoled. Mr Watson-Munro recounts that upon his release the prisoner wants to maintain his drug-free position and to re-enter the workforce with a potential job in the furniture manufacturing industry. To this end he has applied to take an apprenticeship. Mr Watson-Munro expresses the opinion that this again tends to reflect a new found motivation in relation to his rehabilitation.  
     
      
    19 Handwritten notes regarding the prisoner’s efforts in prison to get education and drug and alcohol counselling together with drug analysis reports dated 13 February 2007 and 14 May 2007 were tendered (exhibit 1). These drug analyses disclose that drugs were not detected.  
     
      
    20 Mr Button SC contends that some steps have been taken by the prisoner and there is some ground for optimism for the future. There is, he submits, “a readiness, to try, finally, to deal with what has been going wrong” (POS 12 L 5-6).  
     
      
    21 Whilst the psychologist’s report is favourable to the prisoner, an uncritical acceptance of his opinions is not assisted by the lack of evidence from the prisoner. The handwritten notes and two clear drug analyses do not provide a solid foundation for the adoption of Mr Watson-Munro’s assessment that the prisoner has been drug free for an extensive period. I accept that the prisoner’s personal circumstances as a child and as a teenager were difficult. Although he appears to have taken some positive steps in recent times which if continued will assist in his rehabilitation, the prisoner’s history of re-offending, his failures to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Drug Court to overcome his addiction and to adhere to the conditions of release on parole or on a bond lead me to conclude that his prospects of rehabilitation are poor.  
     
      
       
      
    22 The plea of guilty to manslaughter was entered on the first day of the prisoner’s trial for murder prior to the jury being empanelled. Mr Button SC contends that the prisoner’s plea was entered at the first opportunity and the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea should be assessed at 25 per cent. The Crown, in short, argues that the plea was not entered at the earliest possible time and the value of the utilitarian discount should be assessed at the lower end of the range of 10 to 25 per cent: see R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. A useful chronology of the proceedings against the prisoner is included in exhibit D which is unnecessary to recite here. It is common ground that representations were made to the Crown solicitor on 4 May 2007 about the possibility of the Crown accepting a plea of guilty to manslaughter and the Crown subsequently indicated that it was not disposed to accepting an offer of a plea of guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment for murder. No offer of a plea of guilty to manslaughter was made to the Crown prior to 15 August 2007. 
     
      
    23 Mr Button SC argued that the prisoner could not have offered a plea of guilty to manslaughter in the Local Court whilst the charge of murder was maintained as “all of the matters that would otherwise need to be proven by the Crown, including accessorial liability, would no longer be needed to be proved whilst counsel is instructed”. (POS p18 L 48-54). With that submission I do not agree. If an accused for tactical or personal considerations determines not to offer a plea in the Local Court it can hardly be said that a subsequent offer was made at the first available opportunity. It was open, furthermore, in the application that a no bill be found for the count of murder to include an offer to plead guilty to manslaughter. Mr Button SC also contends it is virtually impossible for an accused’s legal representative to make a firm offer because of s 131(5)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995. This submission ignores the practice adopted by the Director of Public Prosecutions. Such an offer is normally made on a “without prejudice” basis (see Chapter 20 Prosecution Guidelines of Director of Prosecutions) and if rejected would not be commented upon at trial: see Ahmad v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 177 [at 20]. I do not consider that the prisoner’s plea of guilty was entered at the first available opportunity. 
     
      
    24 It appears that the Crown was not prepared to consider manslaughter until Pham was acquitted. It may have been that if the Crown had exhibited some interest in the representations made in May 2007 about the possibility of the acceptance of a plea to manslaughter that a formal offer may have been made by the prisoner prior to the day of the trial. I take this into account as a matter of fairness to the prisoner in assessing the utilitarian value of the plea. The trial was estimated to take some three weeks and the entry of the plea not only saved the cost and inconvenience of a trial but avoided in particular Mrs Sophie Rousianos and Dannis Rousianos being required to give evidence once more. They had given evidence before a jury in the Pham trials on two occasions during which their emotional stress was apparent. 
     
      
    25 The prisoner is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian effect of his plea which I assess at 15 per cent.  
     
      
    26 It is submitted by the Crown that, apart from the plea of guilty, the prisoner otherwise has not expressed remorse for his conduct or for the death of the deceased. Mr Button SC points to the statements of remorse in the psychologist’s report. Little weight would have been attached by me to these statements if it had not been for the circumstances of the prisoner’s plea. The entry by a jury of verdicts of not guilty in the Pham trial may have encouraged the prisoner to stand his trial, however, a plea of guilty was entered to the present offence. I accept that the prisoner has shown contrition and remorse for the offence which I take into account as a factor in mitigation: s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (SP) Act.  
     
      
    27 A victim impact statement of Mrs Sophie Rousianos, the deceased’s mother, was read to the Court (exhibit C). The contents of the statement cannot be used by me to increase the prisoner’s sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 97 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased’s family and express on the community’s behalf its sympathy and compassion for them.  
     
      
    28 Included in the tendered material are Judicial Commission sentencing statistics and cases imposing sentences for manslaughter which I have considered. In Regina v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 Hall J analysed sentences which have been more recently imposed for manslaughter. His Honour recognised [at 191] there is no obvious trend or range discernible in terms of any particular sub-set of manslaughter offences. However, his Honour’s review and the material provided have been of assistance in determining an appropriate sentence. Each case depends on its own facts.  
     
      
    29 As the prisoner is serving the sentence imposed by Maguire DCJ for the offence of supply, it is necessary to consider the principle of totality of criminality: see Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59. The prisoner was sentenced to a “minimum term” of imprisonment of 3 years 7 months and to a “further” term of 13 months. The sentence and the non-parole period commenced on 2 November 2005. The term of the sentence expires on 1 July 2010 and the non-parole period expires on 1 June 2009. Mr Button SC submits that the sentence to be imposed should be partially concurrent with the existing sentence as each offence arose from the prisoner’s heroin addiction. I reject this submission. The prisoner’s desire for revenge was the reason for the present offence and not his drug addiction. The offences represent in my view two discrete and independent acts of criminality.  
     
      
    30 The fact that the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts does not, however, finally determine whether the sentences ought to be imposed partially, concurrently or consecutively: see Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA per Howie J [at 27]. In the present case partial accumulation, would not adequately reflect the criminality of the offence of manslaughter. The aggregate sentence I intend to impose is, in my opinion, just and appropriate for both offences: see Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [18]. 
     
      
    31 There is no merit in Mr Button’s further submission that the prisoner was disadvantaged by both matters not being able to be dealt with together. In any event the District Court sentence was passed on 26 May 2006 some 11 months before the representations made to the Crown solicitor about the possibility of an acceptance of a plea in the present proceedings. It was never a realistic possibility that both matters could have been dealt with at the same time even if they had been within the same jurisdiction. 
     
      
    32 It is agreed that the prisoner has served 32 days in custody solely for the present offence, being the period 1 October 2005 to 1 November 2005. The non-parole period of the current sentence expires, as I have said, on 1 June 2009. Accordingly the date of the commencement of this sentence will be 30 April 2009. 
     
      
    33 The appropriate undiscounted starting point of the sentence, I conclude, is 11 years. The sentence is reduced by 15 per cent to 9 years 4 months. 
     
      
    34 I find special circumstances as the present sentence has been made cumulative upon the existing sentence: see R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58, R v Close (1992) 31 NSWLR 743. By reason of this finding I have assessed a non-parole period of 6 years and 2 months.  
     
      
    35 Hoang Quang Lu for the manslaughter of Phillip Anthony Rousianos I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and 2 months which is to commence on 30 April 2009 and is to expire on 29 June 2015. I set a balance of term of 3 years and 2 months which is to commence on 30 June 2015 and will expire on 29 August 2018.  
     
      
    36 The earliest date of eligibility for your release to parole is 29 June 2015.

    SENTENCEThe name of the offender and any matter which identifies the child victims is not to be published.1 HIS HONOUR: FDP was convicted by a jury on 27 August this year on a charge of maliciously wounding his wife NDP. He was charged with malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, but he was acquitted on that count and convicted on the statutory alternative charge.2 Before the trial commenced he pleaded guilty to three charges of taking his children, contrary to s 87 of the Crimes Act. Those three offences consisted of taking three children at the same time and there are three offences only because there were three children involved.3 Although the charges were preferred under s 87 at a fairly late stage, I am not satisfied that this was the first opportunity for the offender to plead guilty. However, the pleas of guilty meant that it was not necessary for the children to give evidence and there is a strong utilitarian value in that plea.4 On the malicious wounding charge he was, of course, convicted on the return of the jury’s verdict, and he is now convicted of the three charges to which he pleaded guilty. Following the return of the jury, he was remanded in custody and he has been in custody since that time. He was also in custody for a period of two months and nineteen days following his arrest, and between the granting of bail, after that period, and the trial, he was on bail on strict conditions which restricted him to his father’s house, except when he was at work and having other legal and similar appointments, in order to prepare his case.5 The circumstances of the offences followed a domestic dispute in which the wife, who is the victim in the malicious wounding charge, developed legitimate fears for her safety. She left the matrimonial home with her three children and went to a women’s refuge where she stayed for some time. She applied for an Apprehended Violence Order against the offender, to which he consented. It was a condition of that order that he should not have any contact with her or with the children, unless there was an independent person present, and the wife consented in writing.6 NDP’s evidence was to the effect that it was a condition of her staying in the refuge that she should not disclose the location of that place to anybody, particularly her husband. By the time of these offences, there were no Family Law Act orders in place, although FDP gave evidence that he intended to seek orders at one stage.7 NDP’s parents were involved in the matter. They appeared to be keen to effect a reconciliation and they arranged for one successful contact meeting, at which NDP was not present, but they were. The offender was able to meet his three children at a place in Lane Cove, and after that visit, another visit was arranged for a later time.8 There was evidence that the offender was extremely fond of his children and felt very strong responsibilities for them. They were a major part of his life. There was no disagreement about that. Both the offender and his wife gave evidence to that effect, as did a number of other people who gave character evidence in the trial.9 After the first contact visit with the children, the offender took time off work and went to Queensland for a holiday. While he was in Queensland, he had telephone contact with the victim’s father, and he learnt that the planned contact visit with the children had been postponed. This upset him considerably, and he returned to Sydney. When he returned to Sydney, he contacted the victim’s father in order to get him to arrange some telephone contact between NDP and himself as a matter of urgency. He said he was concerned at the cancellation of the contact visit, and he said that the purpose of the call to NDP’s father was to make arrangements for another contact visit. Within a very short time after he contacted NDP’s father, NDP telephoned him and they agreed to meet that afternoon so that he could see the children. NDP said that she had hoped that, with the passage of time, what she described as his controlling behaviour, would change, and reconciliation would be possible. I accept that.10 The offender went home. The inference that I must draw, in view of the jury’s verdict, is that when he was at home he collected a Stanley knife. He then drove his car, via a service station, to the place where he had met the children on a previous contact visit. He then drove them to a park. NDP was present. She knew the park because she had been on outings to that area from the nearby refuge, and it was a suitable area for the children to play. They arrived there at about 4pm.11 After the children had been playing for a short time, the offender put them into the back seat of his car. He then approached NDP and said that he wanted to speak to her. He took her down the slope of the park to an area surrounded by fairly dense bush. There, her evidence was that, and I find that the jury must have accepted this, and been satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt, he grabbed her mobile phone from her back pocket. She attempted to get the phone back and he then punched her several times to the head with his fist, and bruised her. She fell to the ground, she looked up and saw that he had produced the knife, and he stabbed her about six times, causing one deep wound in her shoulder and causing her to bleed. She began to scream extremely loudly and managed to struggle. At that stage, the offender threw the knife away and it was subsequently found close by, after police arrived at the scene. He ran to his car and drove off with the children.12 I must interpret the jury’s verdict of acquittal on the offence charged and conviction on the statutory alternative, that they must have accepted, in large part, NDP’s version of the events, but they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, when the offender went to the meeting, he intended to cause serious injury to her. 13 After she started screaming, neighbours arrived and attempted to talk to her. She was screaming hysterically, and those screams could be heard on recordings of telephone calls, made by bystanders to the emergency number. 14 By this time, the offender had driven away. His evidence was that he was not familiar with the Lane Cove area and he drove north along Centennial Avenue to its intersection with Epping Road. At that point, only a left turn was permitted. He turned left and found himself on the M2 freeway and subsequently on the M7 freeway. He said that he was in a desperate state of mind, but I am not convinced of this beyond reasonable doubt. He did not stop until he reached the service station at Sutton Forrest, where he was recorded on closed circuit television. 15 After making some purchases of petrol and things for the children, he drove to Canberra. He hoped to stay at a hotel in Queanbeyan, where the family had often spent holidays. He knew the owners of this hotel. He contacted them and was told that the hotel was full, but he managed to find accommodation at a motel in Canberra. He went there and stayed overnight with the children.16 The next morning he said that the children switched on the television and he saw a picture of himself, as a person who was being sought by the police. He then contacted the ACT police and arranged to surrender, and, after extensive negotiation with the ACT police, he did that. He was later extradited to New South Wales, charged with these matters and, as I say, spent some time in custody.17 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the abduction of the children was, to some extent, premeditated. I have also found that he brought the knife with him, although I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, and I could not be, in view of the jury’s verdict, that he intended to use it. 18 The victim gave evidence that she had seen that weapon previously at the matrimonial home, which was, in fact, the house of the offender’s father, and she assumed that it belonged to the offender’s brother. 19 The victim’s evidence was that the offender was obsessively controlling and violent. He described himself as a traditional Italian man, and indeed that is borne out by some of the reports that have been tendered on sentence. He clearly did not approve of his wife’s desire to lead a relatively independent life, and this led to the initial friction and the obtaining of the Apprehended Violence Order. He clearly resented losing his children. He blamed his wife and he decided to take the law into his own hands. 20 There was evidence, as I have said, that before these offences he contacted a solicitor about family law proceedings to regain custody, and he received an estimate of the costs. Those were quite high, and at the time he was employed as a truck driver, and he was quite astounded by the costs.21 In this country we have a complex system of family law, which is designed to protect the interests of both children and their parents. The offender decided to fly in the face of this system. I am not just talking about the Family Law Act, but I am also talking about the laws relating to domestic violence. 22 In this case, I am satisfied that the offender consented to an Apprehended Violence Order and he knew exactly what that involved. It is also clear that he blamed his wife for the break up of the family, and particularly for taking the children. He was angry and emotional, and there is evidence that he suffers now from depression, although it is not clear that he was suffering from depression at the time of these offences. The evidence before me on that is contained in the psychologist’s report from Mr Watson-Munro, and any evidence on that matter is hearsay.23 He was certainly angry and emotional, and he said that he was emotional when he returned from Queensland. His evidence was that, during the course of the trip to Canberra, one of the children had mentioned that they had a new daddy. If the offender had known this before the events giving rise to the charges, his anger might have been even greater.24 We have not only a system of criminal law and of family law, but the criminal law seeks to protect all citizens against gratuitous violence. In this case, the offender’s anger and misplaced sense of unfairness drove him to inflict potentially life-threatening violence against an entirely innocent victim, one who, in her naivety, was seeking reconciliation. All these offences are therefore very serious. 25 One of the matters which a court must consider in imposing a sentence is general deterrence. Parents whose marriages break up must be warned that they should not take the law into their own hands, that they should not attempt to punish, physically, spouses with whom they disagree, and that they must not make off with their children without going through the proper processes of the law. If they do, they must expect to be punished severely.26 Personal deterrence is also important. I am not satisfied that FDP appreciates that what he did was wrong. I am not certain that he will not attempt to repeat these actions, and certainly both Mr Watson-Munro’s report and the report of the Probation Officer, suggest that he does not yet accept responsibility for his actions, and that he still blames his wife for what happened.27 FDP is thirty-one years old. He appears to have had a strict Catholic upbringing. He left school after Year 10 and became qualified as a panel beater, although, at the time of these offences, he was, and had been, working as a truck driver, and his employer has indicated that he is prepared to employ him again.28 Mr Watson-Munro says that he is now depressed, and I am satisfied that, certainly since these matters were brought before the courts, at least, he has been anxious and depressed. He is now under medication for depression, and there is no doubt, in my mind, that that is affecting him badly.29 These matters are most unfortunate because, clearly, the break up of the family has had a very profound effect on FDP, leading him to unwise actions.30 I am aware of the sad circumstances which give rise to this matter. In Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302, Johnson J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, reviewed a large number of cases governing the sentencing of offenders for assaults, of various sorts, in what he called domestic violence situations. Those situations do not take the facts of the crimes out of the ordinary run of events, and indeed, in some cases, where there is an Apprehended Violence Order, the offence is made more serious, because the offence itself is a breach of the apprehended violence order. In this case, the offender has admitted that he was in breach of the Apprehended Violence Order, and I will deal with him accordingly.31 The offences fall into two groups. One is the abduction of the children and the other is the malicious wounding of the wife. They were committed fairly close to each other in time, but they are separate and, therefore, the sentences cannot be totally concurrent. There will be a partial accumulation of the sentences and that partial accumulation will accommodate the principle of totality, but it also accommodates the very serious nature, both of the child abduction and of the malicious wounding.32 Before these offences, the offender has never been in custody. He was previously a person of good character. He is clearly very attached to his children and, as his counsel pointed out, it is unlikely that he will see them while he remains in gaol, because of the attitude of Corrective Services. 33 In my view, it would, in any event, be extremely unwise to allow him unsupervised contact with the children during his parole, or contact with his wife during the parole, and, because of the nature of the sentences that I propose, it will not be a matter for me to impose conditions on his parole, but rather for the Parole Board. 34 On each of the child abduction offences under s 87, there will be a non-parole period of two years and a total term of three years and three months. Those sentences will be concurrent. If the offender had not pleaded guilty, then the total term would have been four years, and that discount reflects the utilitarian value of his plea. Those sentences take into account his custody before trial and the restrictive bail conditions. They will commence on 1 June 2007. The non-parole period will expire on 31 May 2009 and the total term on 31 August 2010.35 On the malicious wounding charge, the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and a total term of five years. That will commence on 1 December 2008. The non-parole period will expire on 30 November 2011 and the total term on 30 November 2013.36 Those sentences reflect the fact that I have found special circumstances, particularly the hardship caused to the offender by his depression and the fact that he will not have contact with his children, or is unlikely to have contact with his children, which will make his time in custody more severe.37 I recommend that conditions of parole be that he not have unsupervised contact with his children and that he not approach or attempt to contact NDP.38 In relation to the breach of the Apprehended Violence Order, there will be a fixed term of twelve months imprisonment commencing on 1 June 2007 and expiring on 31 May 2008.

     - 
    SENTENCE1 His Honour: In 2001 Sam Rakoroi worked as a nurse. That is he was engaged in some capacity in his occupation of administering to those with illness, or in his case frailty, in returning to or maintaining their health. Against that background his ferocious and disinhibited attack upon Mark Owen Richardson at about 5.30am on 1 September 2001 is difficult to comprehend. 2 Today Sam Rakoroi is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct. He commenced that process by his plea of guilty to this charge that he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon Mark Owen Richardson with intent thereby to do grievous bodily harm to him. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this court, committed by this offender, harming this victim in this community Gladue v Regina [1999] 1 SCR 688 [80]. 3 My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender subjective matters. The starting point for such assessment requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, whether this offence attracts a standard non-parole period and of course the ultimate length of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as it’s primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined. See R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushy [1977] NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.4 Sam Rakoroi is a Fijian national. In August 2001 he was living with his father. On the night of 31 August 2001, before arriving at the Great Western Bar in Penrith he had been consuming kava with his father. For how long and in what quantities the kava was consumed is, at this distance from the event, unknown. Sometime about 11.30pm he arrived at the Great Western Bar, Penrith. This establishment, it would seem, is well populated on a Friday night providing music, dancing and alcohol. The accused was seen dancing at some time after his arrival. 5 About 4.30am Mark Richardson was walking towards the dance floor. For a moment his passage was blocked. At that time he noticed the offender sitting with his back to the bar, blood coming from his nose. Richardson said, “Are you all right mate, you’re bleeding?” There was no response from the offender. But for this interchange Richardson had never seen the offender; had never had any dealings with him. There is nothing to suggest the offender could have any legitimate cause of grievance towards Richardson.6 In the five hours to this point the offender had been drinking; the facts tendered by the Crown allege, four to five schooners of VB beer. The offender says, in his evidence, it was more. I accept that it was more. Mark Richardson had arrived at the Great Western Bar at about 1.30am. Earlier that night he had been at the Winmalee Tavern. He says he consumed about four schooners spread throughout the night. 7 About 5.30am Mark Richardson decided to leave. He had become separated from his wife and spent some moments looking for her in the Great Western Bar. Thinking she may be outside, he made his way to the exit. There was a short queue at the doorway and he walked out into the street in that queue. The offender was somewhere behind Mark Richardson, following him and others out the door. He apparently spotted Richardson and started shouting at him. Others in Richardson’s group were also with him [Richardson]. Whatever the offender said he attracted Richardon’s attention. 8 By this time Richardson had started to cross the road, the offender stripped off his shirt. Beneath the shirt was a white singlet. As Richardson turned towards the shouting, the offender struck him on the left side of his face with a closed fist. It was a king hit. Richardson fell to the ground. The offender kicked Richardson, more than once, those kicks landed in the region of the upper body and face. Richardson attempted to get to his feet, it seems he may have got to his feet, although whether standing upright is moot. Some members of the crowd meanwhile were trying to restrain the offender. Sadly they failed. He brushed them aside. 9 Richardson had moved about two metres. The offender rushed at him; punched him to the back of the head. Again the victim fell to the ground, this time on the roadway near or perhaps on the gutter. Again the offender kicked Richardson more than once. Again those kicks landed on Richardson’s body. I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, at least one of those kicks connected with Richardson’s head. 10 The incident ceased when a person, Darren Wilson and other persons physically restrained the offender, pulling him away from the now seriously injured Richardson. Once away from Richardson the offender commenced walking towards High Street, putting on his shirt. In the last moments of this disinhibited onslaught Mark Richardson was lying chest down on the eastern side, his head barely raised from the ground. 11 Keron Smithard crouched next to his head, to shield it from further blows. He said to the injured man “Mark it’s me Chubo”. Richardson responded by uttering his rescuer’s name. During this exchange Smithard was kicked to his rib area and to his upper left shoulder, that is to say at least two kicks. Smithard says he was “pretty sure there was more than one person” involved in the kicking. On the evidence before me Smithard is the only witness claiming more than one participant. I am satisfied there was only the one assailant, namely this offender.12 The offender was described by one of the eyewitnesses as being five foot ten to six foot, having short dark hair, which was a bit curly, aged about twenty-eight, solid, stocky build. There was a discrepancy between that description and Richardson’s who thought the man with the bleeding nose that he spoke to was bald. The offender presented in Court with a close shaven head. I am satisfied identification could have been an issue in a contested trial. 13 Dr Alfred J Coren examined Mr Richardson who had, by this time, been taken to the Nepean Hospital. He says that the clinical examination revealed Richardson to be a healthy male of thirty-six years of age, who presented with right peri-orbital ecchymosis and haematoma of the eyelids extending to involve the right cheek. There was also a degree of left peri-orbital haematoma present. So that the offender might understand, haematoma means blood, bleeding. There was no disturbed vision. A tender swelling was present overlaying the left point of his chin. Inter-oral examination revealed gross malocclusion with compound displaced fracture involving the left parasymphysis of the mandible involving the central and lateral incisor teeth on that side. 14 Radiological examination was performed. It revealed that the orbitsan mandible had a small blow-out fracture of the right orbital floor. There was also displaced fracture involving the left parasymphysis of the mandible involving the central and lateral incisor teeth in the line of the fracture. In addition there was a lateral displaced fracture involving the right mandibular condyle. It was necessary to operate on him. 15 For the record the operation involved open reduction and internal fixation of the compound displaced fracture involving the left parasymphysis, involving the central and lateral incisor teeth in the line of the fracture. Application of arch bars to the upper and lower teeth, degloved chin, exposed fracture site of the left parasymphysis of the mandible, reduction into anatomical alignment and immobilise with mini-plate fixation. Osteosynthesis, closed reduction of the fracture right mandibular condyle.16 It is said that Richardson made a very satisfactory post operative recovery. On the second post operative day his teeth were placed into maxillary fixation with elastic bands which was maintained for the next ten day period. Again so that that may be more clearly understood by the offender, I think it is best to use Mr Richardson’s explanation.  
     
      
       
      “To the best of my knowledge my injuries are as follows. A fractured jaw in three places. Both eye sockets fractured. Other cuts and bruises.” 
      
    17 The photographs which clearly were taken shortly after the event and as best I can glean, while he was still in hospital show swelling of the lower face, particularly, it seems to me, around the jaw line and neck; both eye sockets bruised to the extent of being bruised in the lower regions of the sockets; the upper region of the socket above the eyelid, the upper eyelid; grazing to the forehead, the right ear and jaw line below the right ear, to the bridge of the nose, to the upper right temple area and down the face. There is a significant laceration to the left eyebrow, which although it does not appear stitched in the photographs may well have required as many as three. The mouth just shows that both teeth, gums and canals are displaced. Displaced meaning out of alignment. 18. The offender had not travelled far before police spoke to him. That conversation would seem to have been some time shortly after 5.45am but possibly before 6 o’clock. The offender had spoken to at least one other person who knew him, before speaking to the police. Senior Constable Adam Gross said “What happened here tonight?” The offender replied “I got hit by someone and I hit this bloke, but it’s not the same one who hit me. I think he’s gone.”OBJECTIVE CRIMINALITY19 From the facts as he finds them to be a sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender, that is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant case, that is the case I am dealing with, with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact in the overall sentencing outcome. 20 I just pause there to go back to a review of the injuries sustained by the victim. To note that the facts assert and it does not appear to be disputed that the victim sustained ongoing pain and problems with speech. He suffers from arthritic susceptibility due to the injuries sustained.21 I come back to the objective criminality. The criminality of this offence centres upon the intended violence administered to the victim for the purpose of causing him really serious harm. Each person in the community is entitled to the integrity and well being of his body free from vicious attacks, in fact free from any unlawful attack by others. 22 This offence is one of the most serious offences in the criminal calendar, it carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years. It is likely most offences captured by s 33 of the Crimes Act will reflect serious criminality by virtue of the essential elements constituting the offence. Even so there is a wide range of offending conduct that will satisfy the essential elements. I propose to examine the objective criminality of this offence under the following headings. 
     
      level of malice displayed when inflicting grievous bodily harm. 
      nature and level of grievous bodily harm inflicted. 
      time of formulation of intent and its motivation. 
      the nature of the grievous bodily harm intended. 
      the nature of the grievous bodily harm actually inflicted. 
    23 This offender’s malice was displayed primarily in the ferocity of his attack upon Mark Richardson. The event commenced with a king hit in circumstances where the victim had virtually no warning he was about to be attacked. I have found that he actually turned towards his attacker, but he must have wondered what was happening. When Richardson regained his feet and sought to flee there was a second king hit, on this occasion it was from behind. On both occasions when on the ground Mark Richardson was kicked. Those kicks were inflicted towards the upper body, head and face. While I cannot be satisfied a kick was responsible for each fracture of the jaw, I am satisfied more than one forceful blow was needed to cause those fractures and that the only alternative source of a fracture was the second occasion when Mark Richardson fell.24 It would follow from that that while I cannot rule out a fracture may have occurred when the victim fell towards the gutter that fall could not have accounted for all three fractures. This issue may be academic, Mark Richardson did not have a broken jaw when he left the club. The offender’s attacked upon him was both disinhibited and unbridled. As a consequence of this attack he sustained the thrice broken jaw, the fractured eye sockets, substantial grazing, bruising and laceration to his face. 25 The precise mechanism by which each injury was caused is less important than the fact that he sustained all these injuries as a result of the ferocity of the attack. 26 I note the attack was not in company, no weapon was used. The attacked was not previously planned, it was a spontaneous response to seeing the victim, as the offender exited. The attack, while sustained, was not of long duration. There was no element of cruelty or torture used by the offender. While I am satisfied the offender was wearing footwear I could not be satisfied, beyond doubt, he was wearing boots or anything akin to having a steel cap. While there is evidence which I accept of kicking, there is no evidence of stomping. 27 Grievous bodily harm was inflicted. The attack was to the head and the potential for traumatic brain injury was great. The primary injuries were to the face, fractures to the jaw and eye sockets. The victim was hospitalised for six days. He was reviewed after seventeen days. There are lingering disabilities to which I earlier referred. Grievous bodily harm is, of course, an essential element of the offence. Captured within that concept of grievous bodily harm is a wide range of injury starting at the threshold of truly serious injury and reaching to a point of great physical maiming and injury just short of death or injury lasting a lifetime. At its extreme end it could see someone in a wheelchair, in a vegetative state with perhaps loss of limb. 28 Grievous bodily harm can comprise temporary injury that heals leaving no residue of scarring, pain or disability. Grievous bodily harm can also comprise permanent impairment, loss of limb, permanent mental or physical disability. The injuries sustained against that measure were not as gross as some, nor were they at the other end of the grievous bodily harm injury spectrum. 29 These injuries should be placed below a mid range of serious injuries available to be inflicted in offences of this kind, but in a spectrum about halfway between that midrange and the lower end of the spectrum of grievous bodily harm. FORMULATION OF INTENT AND ITS MOTIVE30 This assault was unplanned, it would appear the offender spotted Mark Richardson at about the time he began calling out to him. The offender was well affected by alcohol, consequently his judgment making and executive function skills were impaired. He wrongly associated Mark Richardson as being in some way connected with the altercation he had been involved in earlier in the evening. He commenced to shout at Mark Richardson who, not surprisingly, could only have wondered what it was all about. The intention of assaulting Richardson was formed by the time the offender stripped off his shirt, but not before he began shouting. The intent to do grievous bodily harm was formed by the time the offender hit Mark Richardson, knocking him to the ground the second time and thereafter unmercifully attacked him.31 I am satisfied it was only after the assault that the offender became disabused of his belief as to any association Richardson had with the earlier altercation. I am not satisfied the offender struck Mark Richardson as some gratuitous payback to some random person for an earlier incident against some person he could not find. The offender’s association of Richardson with the earlier injury, he [the offender] had received, genuine as it may have been cannot mitigate the objective seriousness of this offence. See R v Mitchell 2001 NSW CCA 296.THE NATURE OF THE GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM INTENDED32 There is no evidence other than the ferocity of the attack and the area of the body subject to the attack as to the nature of the grievous bodily harm intended. Nor is it likely the offender specifically directed his mind to it. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest the offender intended permanent injury or handicap to his victim. It is likely he intended to beat his victim until the victim was unconscious and any show of resistance had gone and until his own anger had expiated. THE NATURE OF THE GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM INFLICTED33 The injury was of sufficient seriousness as to require hospitalisation, surgery, restructuring of the jaw with mechanical devices inserted into it. The victim impact statement to which I shall shortly come indicates there are some other residual problems, but as against other offences of this kind they are not of major magnitude. In so saying I do not seek to minimise them or the distress they caused to Mr Richardson. THE OFFENDER ON BAIL AT THE TIME OF INCIDENT34 On 4 March 2000 the offender had been charged with high range prescribed concentration of alcohol. Twenty-three days later he was convicted, in his absence, of this offence and of being an unlicensed driver. A warrant was issued. It would appear he was recharged with these matters on 1 September 2001 after his arrest. While it is clear he has been charged with the matters and they were before the courts, what is unclear to me is his bail status. Offences committed in breach of bail or bonds aggravate the criminality associated with the new offence because bail and bonds constitute undertaking made to the court to be of good behaviour and trust reposed in the bailed or bonded offender by the court. 35 While it seems unclear to me, as I say on the evidence, the parties apparently agree the accused was on “some form of bail for the 2001 PCA at the time of the offence.” In those circumstances it must be an aggravating feature of his offending conduct. 36 To qualify as an offence under s 33 Crimes Act 1900, given the elements of s 33 as I earlier said, the offence will always be serious. s 33 offences can be more serious than many manslaughter cases. Even so there is that wide range of criminality to be found in the spectrum of cases.37 In this case, having analysed the elements as best I can, the ferocity of the assault is the feature of greatest criminality by comparison with other features I have examined. In particular the viscous use of the boot on the man on the ground, a man shielding his face as best he could, a man who found himself on the ground as the result of two king hits, one with little warning and the other from behind, justify a finding that the ferocity of the assault is the feature of greatest criminality. 38 The defence rightly concede that full time incarceration is called for. If I were required, for the purposes of setting a standard non-parole period, to embark upon the assessment of whether this offence fell within the mid range of offending, I would assess it as falling below the mid range of seriousness. I would assess it as falling within a range, about halfway between the mid point and offences falling towards the lower end of offending of this kind. 39 That assessment as I say would be based upon the way in which I have analysed the offence and if the feature that I find to be of greatest criminality. Victim Impact Statement40 I have received a victim impact statement from Mr Richardson, the material contained in the victim impact statement is not sworn evidence and has not been subject to cross-examination. To the extent that opinions are expressed in it, I recognise they are not the opinions of a qualified expert. 41 The victim impact statement coming a it does from the primary victim may, if I accept it as reliable, provide unsworn evidence as to the fact of the offences and their effect upon him. The function of statements such as this one is firstly to give victims the opportunity of being heard in sentencing proceedings by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited upon them by the actions of an offender. Secondly, to enable the sentencing proceedings to assist victims as they move towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the criminal conduct of an offender.42 Thirdly, the victim impact statement contributes to an offender, at least hearing first hand and perhaps gaining insight into the impact his offending conduct had upon the victim. Finally, the victim impact statement ensures that the Court has a continuing consciousness of the impact violent crime has upon those ordinary men and women who are its victims. As such, victim impact statements play an important part in the administration of criminal justice.43 Although the victim impact statement was typed by a witness assistance officer, it seems to me, as I read it through, that the words used are by and large the words of the victim. He says that since the assault his wife and others describe him as being short tempered. He claims to be easily frustrated. Instead of dealing with things he says he goes off the handle. His children always talk about when “Daddy got bashed up”. “My daughters talk about it a lot” and it’s very upsetting for him that they don’t forget this. He feels that when they are out, if anything happens he cannot stick up for himself. If he is with his children and they say “No Daddy” now, he cannot protect himself, or raise what is correct behaviour and he is concerned that they thing something will happen.44 He says that it’s always in the back of his mind that something else will happen and that he is scared that something else could happen. It would appear he is also distressed because his family take the same view that something could happen.45 Since this has happened he does not go out anywhere in Penrith. He has not been there after dark since this happened and in that sense it has impacted upon his social life. Again he makes the comment that his wife is scared of something happening to him and it would seem that he is distressed by that. Likewise his parents are upset by it and it would seem that he is distressed by that too.46 As to his physical injuries he still has numbness from three-quarters of the way along his bottom lip to the left hand side of his face. He has a permanent tightness in the left side of his jaw, which he believes to be permanent and a constant condition. He says that he has speech problems in that he becomes tongue-tied when he gets emotional and worked up.47 He says that he is often told by family members about bits of food or dribble stuck to his face, of which he is unaware, because of that loss of feeling in his face, but that causes him embarrassment. If he talks too long his jaw becomes sore. There are complications with chewing particularly foods like steak. He no longer participates in body contact sports, even touch football because he fears risk of further injury and says that there is an effect upon his quality of life with regards to sport.48 There is scar tissue inside his mouth and although it is internal nevertheless it is physical and it seems to have a psychological and emotional affect upon him. His left eye vision is blurry to some extent. He wears glasses. He noted that when he recovered, his eyesight started to go and that prior to the attack he had perfect vision. He worries whether this is a coincidence or not because his vision was never a problem before. His teeth also throb a bit. He has had to have post operative dental treatment. His dentist has a history of x-rays that show metal pins and the like, in his jaw and other aspects of his injury. He can feel the ache line where it all is.SUBJECTIVE MATTERS49 I turn now to the subjective matters, I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for this criminal offence but I am also sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of this particular offence, by this offender and some reason why a more or less sentencing outcome is appropriate.Personal circumstances, family background, relationships.50 This offender is aged twenty-nine at the time of sentence. At the time of the offence he was aged twenty-two. As stated at the outset Rakoroi is a Fijian national. His father came to Australia when the offender was aged seven. At the age of fifteen, he and his sister migrated to Australia, their mother remained in Fiji. He has not seen her since 1991. He appears well supported by his step-mother, who has been at Court on each occasion. 51 Prior to his leaving Fiji a senior member of the extended family, who he describes as an uncle, sexually assaulted him. Others of his siblings were also sexually abused by the same man, suggesting the abuse was predatory and repetitive. He conceded in evidence he is still having personal difficulties arising from this part of his history. He has two children from a prior relationship, one aged nine and the younger four. He has a twenty-seven year old girlfriend, who is pregnant with his third child, expecting that child in April, 2008.Education, skills and employment52 Sam Rakoroi completed School Certificate Level at Year 10. He completed a two year nursing certificate course working three years thereafter in a nursing home. For the past eighteen months he has worked as a storeman at Elspac Aluminium. Probation and Parole Report his employer regarded him as an excellent employee who worked without supervision and was self motivated. He resigned from this employment prior to this matter being listed on Monday, to improve his chances of re-employment there upon release. 53 The offender has an interest and apparently skills in Rugby. He was playing rugby at the time of this offence for a Penrith based team. General Health.54 The offender presents as a fit, solidly built man. As best one can tell from appearances he appears to be in good physical health. Mental Health.55 There is nothing before me to suggest any mental health issues that would impact upon his rehabilitation or social interaction in the community. There are some signs of depression. He was weeping in Court on more than one occasion during the hearing of this matter. He has personal issues to work through relating to his sexual assault. There are anger issues that may relate to his unresolved sexual issues or some other pathology.ALcohol and Drug Abuse.56 He acknowledges he drank to high levels of intoxication as a young man. He drank weekly Fridays and Saturday nights with members of his Rugby Club until he was staggering drunk with little or no memory of his drunken night the following day. The effect of his evidence was that the Friday night in question was an example of that level of drinking. However his conduct during the fight would suggest his level of intoxication was, at least on this occasion, not one of being staggering drunk. There are two factors that persuade me of that, firstly, the vigour of the attack and secondly, the presence of mind to take his shirt off prior to the attack, presumably to keep it clean or untorn or unsoiled. 57 In fairness though he did say, “I don’t know when I started drinking that night, but I did have a lot to drink.”CHaracter and Criminal History.58 This offender is twenty-nine years old. Thus far he appears to have a strong work ethic with good feed back from his last employer. Since the offence he has been in further trouble with the law consistent with his alcohol abuse. I will come shortly to his offending prior to today. At the time of the offence his record had no convictions for violence and there was one PCA conviction on his record and a conviction for offensive behaviour.59 When dealing with him for this offence he is entitled to have some leniency on account of that record. His subsequent convictions include a s 10 dismissal for contravene apprehended domestic violence. There is one further assault 2002; in 2003 a further PCA and drive whilst disqualified. There is nothing in that record which suggests problems with rehabilitation. This present offence is far and away the most serious offending he has ever done. His antecedents together with the probation and parole report suggests a prior unwillingness though to cooperate with agencies in the criminal justice system.60 There are numerous convictions entered in his absence. A warrant issued for his arrest. The probation and parole report notes he currently has an outstanding breach of CSO matter (17/9/07). It also notes there failure to comply with reporting conditions of a bond imposed on 3 March 2002, to a point where breach proceedings were initiated. On three occasions he commenced the Pacific Islander programme. This is a programme designed by probation and parole but run by Pacific Islanders to facilitate Pacific Islanders dealing with stressors leading to Pacific Island men and women committing criminal offences.61 The course is a group therapy course of sixteen two hour lectures or two hour sessions rather than based on weekly attendance. On his third occasion he committed to and completed the course. His group comprised eleven Islanders, Samoan’s, Tongan’s and Fijian’s. Nine men and two women. Probation and parole assessed “[he] demonstrated positive attitude and discipline on the programme. His demonstrated positive attitude and discipline on the programme and recent employment all could indicate that Mr Rakoroi may have learnt to deal with stressors in a more positive way.”62 The author also observed continued counselling and support could assist in maintaining these changes. It is likely the offender has gained in maturity and insight as a consequence of his participation in the Pacific Islander programme. As a father he has no access to his two children. Their mother has resisted him having access. He has, however, recently paid $4,000 overdue child support payments being the total sum outstanding on that account.ATTITUDE TO OFFENCE.63 I am satisfied the offender is profoundly contrite. Counsel has taken him through the photographs, taken very shortly after the assault. I am satisfied they gave him an insight into the effect of his offending conduct. The plea was entered before the Magistrate but as far as I can tell on 29 June 2007 there had been negotiation in the Local Court noted on the file on 9 February 2007. Those negotiations sought to revive earlier negotiations being conducted five years earlier. The matter had originally come before the Local Court on 17 September 2001 where it lingered until 28 June 2006. The delay to that point related to the Crown’s desire to secure DNA evidence. 64 On 28 June 2002 the offender was not before the court, an arrest warrant was to issue. His bail was forfeited. Significantly he was charged on 15 November 2002; was before the Fairfield Local Court on 26 February 2003 on a first instant warrant. Charged with low range PCA on 10 September 2003. Charged with drive whilst disqualified on 18 November 2004. A second charge for the same offence on 20 December 2004. In respect of those offences he may have done custody from 31 July 2005 to 4 October 2005. Yet it would appear the hearing of this matter is not revived until 19 October 2006. There is incarceration commencing on 5 October 2006. 65 There appears to be a level of inefficiency by those managing the warrant index. That this offender could be charged and dealt with, in one instance on a first instance warrant, yet the warrant apparently issued by the Magistrate for his failure to appear and at the time his bail was forfeited was never activated. As I say that warrant was issued on 28 June 2002. 66 Two issues arise from this. Firstly, what, if any of that delay in finalising this matter is attributable to each of the parties. Secondly, what, if any, impact does the history have upon the offender’s entitlement to utilitarian discount for the plea. 67 Certain aspects of the utilitarian value to the plea, to the administration of criminal justice are maintained. This guilty plea must still be recognised as a significant contribution to this offender of advancing the administration of criminal justice, in this case, firstly and foremostly because the interests of the administration of criminal justice are served through the public acknowledgement by an offender of his guilt. 68 Pleas of guilt by offenders sustain the communities confidence in the administration of criminal justice by maintaining the confidence of the community in the investigation of crime and the communities’ expectation that those guilty of crime will be held accountable for it. The administration of criminal justice in this case is also served because court time, witnesses time, legal expenses and the like are freed so that they can be devoted to other cases. 69 The plea reduce considerably the likelihood of contest in an appeal on the issue of guilt. These are all important utilitarian factors insofar as the administration of criminal justice is concerned in this case. However, if 25 percent discount is allowed for full utilitarian value that would not be this case. His failure to appear, the necessity of a Magistrate to issue a warrant, the numerous subsequent Local Court appearances, post October 2005, the revival of the negotiations, all impact upon the utilitarian value of this plea when measured against those who plead quickly on service of the Crown brief or even on occasions before service of the Crown brief. 70 Further the failure to adhere to bail dissipates the quality of the utility of the earlier mentioned matters. For those reasons I have diminished the discount I will give in this case to one of seventeen and a half percent.Delay.71 As to delay it must be remembered an arrest warrant is an order of the court. Orders of the court should be executed by the administrative arm of government as soon as practical after being made. What that means in this case is that whether it was practical for a warrant to have been executed prior to 5 October when it seems it was. On the other hand the offender failed to answer his bail. Any delay caused by this failure must be seen as his fault. Nonetheless the court order that he be arrested was about ensuring that justice was done as speedily was it could be. 72 In my view it is inexplicable he was not arrested on a warrant of arrest issued in respect of this matter in February 2003, September 2003, November 2004, and July 2005. In these circumstances I intend to make some allowance for delay. While I recognise that delay occurs as a breach of his bail, any allowance made in those circumstances must be significantly more muted than it otherwise may have been. But given the absence of efficiency in the warrant system he is also being dealt with later than that he otherwise would have been.Rehabilitation prospects.73 His rehabilitation prospects are to be assessed as he stands for sentence today. Of some relevance as positive indicators are 
     
     His general good health. 
     His work ethic in recent years and the good report of his employers. His training as a nurse. Both mean that he is likely to be able to find employment upon release.  
     His contritition and insight into his offending conduct. 
     His relatively minor criminal record relating primarily to driving. 
     His recent maturing as a result of the Pacific Islander programme. 
     His family support and the support of his girlfriend. 
     His motivation for committing this offence was apparently based on an error, that is unlikely to reoccur in future. 
     A lack of connections with the criminal milieu.  
    74 There are some negatives that need to be balanced and taken into account. 
     
     A prior inability to cooperate with criminal justice agencies. 
     His past serious abuse of alcohol. 
     His need to resolve personal issues underlying his anger and his past experience of being sexually assaulted. 
    SETTING THE SENTENCE.75 While this may be viewed as a stale offence General and specific deterrence are still of importance. By specific deterrence I mean deterrence aimed at persons who would be willing to commit similar offences. I have certainly taken that into account.STANDARD NON-PAROLE PERIOD76 Since February 2003 a standard non-parole period can be applicable to this offence. This offence occurring as it did eighteen months earlier is not caught by the standard non-parole considerations. The proper approach to this sentencing is to apply the sentencing tariffs and norms applying in 2001. 77 I have been supplied with JIR statistics showing the distribution of sentences for 159 cases of this offence where the offence was committed prior to February 2003. Ninety-four percent of offenders in this distribution were sentenced to full-time incarceration. Ninety-nine percent were sentenced to some form of imprisonment. 78 The head sentences are spread from eighteen months to sixteen years. Thirty-one percent of offenders in that distribution received a non-parole period of two and a half years or less. Twenty-five percent received a non-parole period of two years or less. Twenty-five percent of offenders received a head sentence of three and a half years or less and thirty-three percent received a head sentence of four years or less.APPLYING THE PLEA DISCOUNT.79 But for the plea of guilty I would have set an overall sentence for this offence of five years imprisonment. Applying a seventeen and a half percent discount, the sentence reduces to one of four years, two months and fifteen days. I have been urged by the defence to find special circumstances. The Crown has not opposed that submission. I have determined this is an appropriate case for finding special circumstances. 
     
     this is the offender’s longest time in custody. 
     he agrees he needs to pursue counselling in relation to the sexual assaults earlier committed upon him. That is best achieved through consultation with psychologists at a Community Health Centre. 
     after April 2008 his prison time will be particular arduous as his girlfriend delivers their child and raises it in his absence. 
     his other rehabilitation is better achieved in the community. 
    80 The offender has been in custody since 6 November 2007, that is Monday of this week. However it has just occurred to me during the reading of these remarks that he has also probably spent, it would appear to me, three days, 5 October 2006, 19 October 2006 and 13 April 2007 in custody. I intend to allow those three days. I can do that best by back dating this sentence to 3 November 2007.81 Sam Rakoroi I convict you of this offence that you on first day of September 2001 at Penrith maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon Mark Owen Richardson with intent thereby to do grievous bodily harm to him. For that offence I sentence you to a non-parole period of two years and four months to date from 3 November 2007 and to expire on 2 March 2010. I set a balance of term of one year, ten months and fifteen days to expire on 17 January 2012.82 The first day you will be eligible for release to parole will be 2 March 2010. In order to be released to parole you will need to persuade the Parole Board that you are a suitable candidate for parole on or by 2 March 2010. If you do not persuade them, they do not have to release you on that day. 83 I formally recommend you do be released for parole on that date as you presently stand before me. If things change because of your behaviour in the gaol system they are not bound to accept my recommendation. I recommend to the Parole Board that you be supervised by Probation and Parole for at least the first eight months of your parole period. I recommend further that you be required to reattend the Pacific Islander programme and reconnect in that way with the community and expected behaviour of you in the community. I further recommend that you also be required to attend your local Community Health Centre and seek a course of counselling in relation to that history of sexual abuse that you told me about.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is a determination of the question of the unfitness to be tried of Huy Pham, who I will refer to as “the accused”, for a number of offences. 2 The accused has been charged with the following offences allegedly committed on 4 August 2004.  1. That he murdered Chi Cong Pham (who was his wife’s uncle). 
     
      
      2. That he shot at Joanne Ngo (who is his wife) with intent to murder her. 
       
      3. That he threatened to use an offensive weapon, namely a pistol, with intent to commit an indictable offence. 
       
      4. That he maliciously damaged by fire a pharmacy at Riverwood, which was the property of his wife. 
       
      5. That he used a firearm, namely a pistol, without being authorised to do so. 
       
      6. That he possessed a firearm, namely a pistol, without being authorised to do so. 
      
    3 The accused was arrested on 5 August 2004, the day after the offences were allegedly committed. On 4 May 2005 he was committed for trial to this court. At a first arraignment listing in this court on 1 July 2005 the question of his fitness or unfitness to be tried was raised. On 25 September 2005 the Solicitor-General made a determination that an inquiry into the accused’s fitness to be tried should be conducted pursuant to the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act. 4 On 17 February 2006 a jury found the accused unfit to be tried on the charges and the matter was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. On 19 May 2006 a notification was received from the Mental Health Review Tribunal that the tribunal had formed the opinion that the accused would become fit to be tried during a period of twelve months after the finding of unfitness to be tried. On 12 July 2007 notification was received from the Mental Health Review Tribunal that the tribunal had formed the opinion that the accused had become fit to be tried. A further hearing of the question of the accused’s fitness or unfitness to be tried was fixed for hearing.  
     
      
    5 At the present hearing it was common ground between counsel for the Crown and counsel for the accused that, because the criminal proceedings against the accused were commenced before the commencement of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Amendment Act 2005 No 109, the former ss 11 and 11A of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act were applicable, see Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act Schedule 1 cl 3(2), Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Amendment Act Schedule 1 cl 4. 6 An election dated 9 November 2007 signed by the accused was filed with the court. In this document the accused elected to have the question of his unfitness to be tried determined by a judge alone. The election further stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have sought and received advice in relation to this election from Robyn Clark, a practising solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. I have understood the advice that has been given to me. Even though I have made this election and signed this document I am aware that at any time before the date fixed for the determination of my unfitness to be tried I may elect to have the question of my unfitness determined by a jury.” 
        
       
      
    7 The document includes a consent by the Director of Public Prosecutions to the election by the accused which has been signed on behalf of the Director. 8 A report by Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 23 October 2007 was admitted into evidence. Dr Nielssen had also seen the accused on a number of previous occasions and had furnished reports dated 1 February 2005, 4 August 2005 and 17 May 2007. In the last paragraph of his report of 23 October 2007 Dr Nielssen said he, the accused, was assessed by Dr Nielssen to be able to understand legal advice regarding an election to have his fitness for trial decided by a judge sitting alone. 9 The test of fitness or unfitness to be tried, which has been consistently applied by the courts, is the test which was stated by Smith J of the Victorian Supreme Court in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48.  
     
      
       
        
        “It is whether the accused because of mental defect fails to come up to certain minimum standards which he needs to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to him. He needs…to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceedings, namely that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all of the various court formality. He needs to be able to understand…the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; he needs to be able to make his defence or answer the charge. Where he has Counsel he needs to be able to do this through his Counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his Counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence but he must…have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his Counsel, if any.” 
        
       
      
    10 This passage in the judgment of Smith J in R v Presser has been approved on a number of occasions by the High Court including in Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230 at 245 per Mason CJ, Toohey J and Gaudron J. In Kesavarajah the majority of the High Court said that the length of any trial of the charges is also a relevant factor. In the present case, I have been informed that any trial of the charges would be likely to be quite short. 11 Under s 6 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is to be determined on the balance of probabilities. Under s 12 of the Act the accused person is to be represented by counsel or a solicitor, the inquiry is not to be conducted in an adversary manner and the onus of proof of the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried does not rest on any particular party. In the present case the accused has been represented by counsel and a solicitor. 12 The only evidence from the Crown in this trial was a report by Dr Bruce Westmore, psychiatrist, of 28 October 2007. Dr Westmore had seen the accused on a number of previous occasions. Counsel for the accused did not seek to cross-examine Dr Westmore. As this report by Dr Westmore was the only evidence adduced by the Crown, I propose to set out the bulk of the report verbatim.  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        RE-EXAMINATION OF MR PHAN 
         
        I asked him how he had been since I last examined him he stated, ""Bad."" I asked him what he meant by that and he told me he had difficulties remembering ""the past problem"". I asked him was he facing charges and he said yes. I asked him what those charges were and he said, ""Murder and attempted murder."" I asked him how he wanted to plead to the charges and he said, ""I don't know what to do because it is like waking up in the new world."" 
        
       
       
        
        I asked him who it was alleged he had murdered. He said, ""A lot of these psychiatrists tell me I murdered the uncle of my wife."" Mr Phan then started speaking spontaneously and he said, ""My wife is having an affair with her uncle, incest. The brother of her mother. The doctor tell me."" 
         
         
        I then asked him what it was he had done and stated, ""That I killed my wife's uncle and attempted to kill my wife as well because she is having an affair with her uncle."" I asked him did he remember doing that and he said, ""To be honest I don't really remember."" I asked him what did he remember of the incident and he said, ""Reading through the brief, I can't relate it to the incident."" 
         
         
        I then asked him did he still believe that his wife was having an affair with her uncle. He said, ""Yes I see that with my own eyes."" Mr Phan then told me that he was ""very tired mentally"". 
         
         
        He said he was returning to court on 2 November 2007. He thought that was a hearing and that the ""actual thing is on 12 November."" 
         
         
        I then asked Mr Phan had the doctors told him that he suffered a mental illness. He said ""Yes, schizophrenia and delusion."" I asked him how did he want to plead to the charges he had referred to earlier. He said not guilty. I asked him on what basis he would make such a plea and he said, ""In my belief, you can't have an affair with your uncle."" I asked him directly did he think he had a mental illness, he said no. I then asked him had his lawyer discussed with him the possibility of raising a mental illness defence. He said not really. I asked him if the doctor said that he did have a mental illness defence, would he consider entering a plea of not guilty by way of mental illness. He responded by stating, ""Are you saying that I should believe my doctor?"" I did not respond to his question but asked him would he consider entering a plea of not guilty because of mental illness if his lawyer suggested that. He said, ""Yes, I will do forensic."" 
         
         
        I then asked him what the judge's job was in court. He said, ""They listen to both parties and sentence me."" Of the solicitor's role in court he said, ""To defend, to tell the story."" I asked him did he have faith in his solicitor. He said he would have faith in a private solicitor but he was not too sure of his legal representation because of legal aid. He said the jury would ""listen to both parties and hand down a verdict."" He understood the oath was sworn so people told the truth. I asked who was against him in court and he said, ""Witnesses and the DPP."" 
         
         
        I then took an updated autobiographical history from Mr Phan. 
         
         
        PAST MEDICAL HISTORY (UPDATE) 
         
        He has had no surgery or medical problems since I last examined him. He has been in a mental health unit in Silverwater and has seen psychiatrists frequently. 
         
         
        DRUG AND ALCOHOL HISTORY (UPDATE 
         
        He said he currently takes three or four different types of medication but couldn't provide details. He thought the medication was helping and he said he can now sleep and eat and he was gaining weight. 
        
       
       
        
        FAMILY HISTORY (UPDATE) 
         
        One brother continues to live in Sydney but he does not want to see that brother whom he described as having stupid ideas. He has a brother and sister who live in Vietnam and they came to visit him a few months ago, both have now returned to Vietnam. 
         
         
        PERSONAL HISTORY (UPDATE) 
         
        He said he had been in Silverwater for six or seven months and during that time he has been managed in a psychiatric unit. 
         
         
        MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION 
         
        Mr Phan presented in a neat and tidy fashion, he was pleasant and cooperative. He appeared to have gained weight since I last examined him. He maintained reasonably good eye contact, although there was a blank and staring quality to his facial expression. This probably arises from his psychiatric illness and possibly the effects of treatment. He spoke spontaneously and expansively. Both his affect and mood were quite restricted. I thought his thought content continued to reflect delusional beliefs. Mr Phan acknowledges continuing to hear auditory perceptual disturbances which he said troubled him during the day and sometimes talked to him. He also receives messages from the radio. 
         
         
        I tested his cognitive function, he was able to subtract seven from one hundred on a single occasion, but was unwilling to proceed with that test. I then asked him to subtract three from twenty. He indicated the answer seventeen, but then again would not proceed. I then took him through each separate serial subtraction and he did that successfully. The problem appears not to be one of cognitive capacity, but more one of perseverance and persistence. 
         
         
        DOCUMENT REVIEW 
         
        In my report of 15 March 2005 1 was not able to take a full history from Mr Phan because of significant delays before he attended for the examination. I did however see him for about forty minutes and I later advised your office that he would need to be reassessed. I attended Parklea Prison on 3 April intending to reassess him, but he did not attend. I did however review some documents in my report dated 6 April 2005 and I provisionally diagnosed Mr Phan as suffering from a delusional disorder. 
         
         
        On 12 September 2005, I was able to reassess Mr Phan at the Long Bay Prison Hospital. I referred again to the provisional diagnosis of a delusional disorder and I expressed concerns that if he was mentally ill and if he had no insight into that fact and if was unable or unwilling to acknowledge that possibility, it was probable he would not be able to, in a reasonable or rational way, consider the full ranges of defences which might be available to him. I thought that if that occurred, he would be unfit to be tried. I also noted that since I last examined Mr Phan, he had attempted suicide by overdosing on a substance he obtained in prison, possibly heroin. Another psychiatrist indicated that as a result of the overdose, Mr Phan suffered acute brain trauma which led to a severe impairment of his cognitive processes.  
        During  
        the examination on 8 September 2005 1 noted he described a global type of memory disturbance affecting both long and short term memories. I thought he was unfit to be tried. 
         
         
        I saw Mr Phan on the third occasion on 27 January 2006. 1 read that he had suffered a severe brain injury from a drug overdose which occurred in the first half of 2005. 1 indicated that if his continued history of reported memory difficulties was a true and accurate reflection of his current cognitive function, then I thought he remained unfit to be tried. 
         
         
        I would note that apart from your letter of introduction, my handwritten clinical notes and my typed formal report, only selective documents from any you have sent me will be kept. Other documents will either be destroyed or returned to your office. Due to the size of legal briefs it is not usually possible to examine all the documents in detail. Should I be required to give evidence in court, I would request that copies of all the documents including your letter of introduction be brought to court in case I need to make reference to them. I would also request that if you feel there are any documents amongst the ones you have sent me that I have not reviewed in detail or which you feel may have relevance to the matters I am considering, that you bring those to my immediate attention. 
         
         
        OPINION 
         
        In relation to Mr Phan's fitness, I am of the view that he is able to understand what he has been charged with and he is now indicating that he would consider entering a plea of not guilty by way of mental illness. He is as able as any other accused person to exercise his right of challenge of jurors, although that has always seemed to me to be a difficult if not impossible task. His responses in relation to the important people in court indicates that he understands that he is involved in an adversarial process and that a trial would involve an enquiry into whether or not he did what he was charged with. 
         
         
        Despite the presence of some problems with perseverance in intellectual function, I am of the view that he would, in a general sense, be able to follow the proceedings, although some allowance may need to be made if he tires during lengthy periods of the trial. His legal representatives may need to check on him from time to time to ensure that he is still attending and concentrating and following proceedings. 
         
         
        He would have the capacity to understand the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him and he will be able to make his defence although it is likely his defence will be based on a belief system which is probably delusional in nature. There was nothing in the recent examination to indicate that he could not give his legal representatives a history similar to the one he provided to me and he could also give that account to the court as well if required. 
         
         
        I am now of the view that Mr Phan is fit to be tried.” 
         
        
       
      
    13 The only evidence from the defence in this trial, apart from the report of Dr Nielssen to which I have already referred, was a report by Dr Nielssen of 17 May 2007. In this report Dr Nielssen diagnosed the accused as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia in partial remission and hypoxic brain injury which is resolving. Dr Nielssen’s conclusions under the heading “opinion” on p 3 of his report were as follows.  
     
      
       
        
        “The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on the history of typical symptoms of schizophrenia over a period of at least four years. The subtype of paranoid refers to a form of the illness in which the predominant symptom is a delusional belief with relative preservation of other aspects of mental function. In this case the belief was that his wife was having an affair with the victim, which the evidence indicates was a delusional belief on his part. 
        
       
       
        
        The diagnosis of hypoxic brain injury is based on the well documented medical consequences of the serious overdose Mr Phan took whilst in Parklea Correctional Centre in 2005. he has made a good recovery from the injury, although there are subtle changes in his presentation that were thought to be due to personality change arising from the brain injury. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Phan has recovered sufficiently to be considered fit for trial. He is aware of the charges, the nature of the proceedings and was assessed to be able to follow the proceedings. He acknowledges that he has been mentally ill and does not object to the issue of mental illness being raised as his defence. He was assessed to able to give instructions to a legal representative.” 
         
        
       
      
    14 Counsel for the Crown did not seek to cross-examine Dr Nielssen on his report. 15 In accordance with the evidence which each had adduced, each counsel submitted that I should find that the accused is fit to be tried for the offences which have been charged. 16 I have concluded that, notwithstanding the diagnosis by Dr Nielssen that the accused is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia in partial remission and an hypoxic brain injury which is resolving, the criteria in R v Presser are satisfied. I have concluded inter alia that the accused is able to understand the charges brought against him; that he does understand that he could enter a plea of not guilty on the ground of mental illness if his lawyers advise that course; he does understand generally the nature of any trial, that is, that he is being prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, that the jury or other tribunal of fact would listen to the evidence of both parties and reach verdicts; that he would be able to follow the course of the proceedings and understand the substantial effect of the evidence for the Crown and to make a defence to the charges. 17 I, accordingly, find that the accused is not unfit to be tried for the offences or, expressing the conclusion positively, I find that the accused is fit to be tried for the offences charged. 18 Accordingly, under s 13 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act the criminal proceedings which have been brought against the accused for the offences are to continue in accordance with the appropriate criminal procedures.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 13 November 2007 the accused, Huy Pham, was indicted before me in a judge-alone trial on the following charges that: 
     
      
       (1) on 4 August 2004 at Cabramatta he murdered Chi Cong Pham 
       
        
        (2). on 4 August 2004 at Cabramatta he shot at Joanne Ngo with intent to murder her 
         
        (3) on 4 August 2004 at Riverwood he threatened to use an offensive weapon, a pistol, with intent to commit an indictable offence 
        
       
       (4) on 4 August 2004 he maliciously damaged by fire a pharmacy at Riverwood the property of Joanne Ngo 
       
        
        (5) on 4 August 2004 at Cabramatta he used a firearm, a pistol, without being authorised to do so 
         
        (6) on 4 August at Liverpool he possessed a pistol without being authorised to do so 
        
       
      
    2 The person named as the victim in the first charge was an uncle of the accused’s wife Joanne Ngo, who is the victim named in the second charge.  
     
      
    3 When indicted on these charges the accused pleaded not guilty to all of them. His counsel informed the court that each plea of not guilty was a plea of not guilty by reason of mental illness.  
     
      
    4 Earlier this week, on 12 November, I conducted a judge-alone trial for the purpose of determining the question of the accused’s fitness to be tried on the charges and I found that the accused was fit to be tried on the charges. Dr Bruce Westmore, a psychiatrist retained by the Crown, and Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist retained by the defence, gave evidence that in their opinion the accused was fit to be tried.5 The evidence in the present trial of the charges against the accused consisted of the Crown brief, which contained three volumes of witness statements and other evidentiary materials, and reports by Dr Westmore retained by the Crown and by Dr Nielssen retained by the defence. There was no issue about the facts of the offences and the statements of the witnesses clearly establish the following facts beyond reasonable doubt.6 The accused was married to Joanne Ngo in March 1996. After their marriage the accused and Joanne Ngo lived at her parents home at 51 Coventry Street, Cabramatta. There was one child of the marriage, a daughter born in 1997. In October 2003 the accused and Joanne Ngo separated. The accused moved to rented premises at 2/33 Nagle Street, Liverpool. After the separation there was only occasional contact between the accused and Joanne Ngo.7 On 1 August 2004 the deceased Chi Cong Pham and his sister arrived from Vietnam to spend some time in Australia with their extended family. On the evening of 4 August 2004 Chi Cong Pham and other members of the extended family went to 51 Coventry Street. It was proposed that a large number of family members would go to a restaurant in Cabramatta for a meal.8 At about 7.30 the persons in the house noticed that something had happened to the power supply in the house. Some lights in the house went out and a number of electrical appliances stopped. An uncle of Joanne Ngo observed that the front door to the house was partly open. He walked towards the front door. When he reached the door, the door was pushed open and the uncle saw the accused standing at the door holding a hand gun with a silencer attached.9 The accused walked into the dining room of the house. He said in Vietnamese “let’s talk”. The persons in the dining room could see the gun that the accused was holding and some of them ran towards the back door of the house. Others remained seated at a table in the dining room. The accused pointed the gun at Chi Cong Pham, who was sitting at the table. Chi Cong Pham asked the accused why the accused was pointing the gun at him and he stood up. The accused counted aloud, “five, four, three, two, one” and then fired the gun at Chi Cong Pham. Chi Cong Pham fell to the floor. He said, “I didn’t do any harm to you, why did you shoot me?”10 The accused stood stationary for a few seconds and then walked back and forth a few times. The accused then stepped towards Chi Cong Pham, where he was lying face down on the floor, and fired three or four more shots into Chi Cong Pham’s back. The accused then moved to about a metre from Chi Cong Pham and fired one more shot into his body.11 Joanne Ngo was in a bedroom at 51 Coventry Street, when the accused entered the house. She looked out from the bedroom and saw the accused. She remained in the bedroom. She heard a noise and one of her aunts saying, “Oh, my God, you shot my brother.” Joanne Ngo sat on the floor of her bedroom with her back against the door and made an emergency call on her mobile telephone. She could feel the door of the bedroom being forced in against her.12 The accused entered the bedroom, holding the gun and pointing it at Joanne Ngo. The accused fired two shots, one of which entered Joanne Ngo’s chest and the other of which entered her cheek. The accused walked out of the bedroom. 13 The accused left 51 Coventry Street, Cabramatta and drove to Riverwood, where Joanne Ngo, who was a qualified pharmacist, conducted a pharmacy. The accused drove the car at the building, smashing the shop window of the pharmacy. The accused got out of the car holding the gun. He pointed the gun at a person who had approached. This act of the accused gave rise to the third charge in the indictment. The person at whom the gun was pointed took two steps backward and then turned his back and ran. The accused went into the pharmacy and set fire to it, using an accelerant.14 The accused was arrested at 2/33 Nagle Street, Liverpool on 5 August 2004. At the time of his arrest he told police: 
     
      
       
        
        “I will tell you everything, you have got everything. On the table is a tape recorder and it has my confession on it. It has everything you want on it.” 
         
        
       
      The accused also said: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “I understand I have done the wrong thing.” 
        
       
       
      When asked by the woman with whom he was living what he had done, the accused said: 
       
       
        
        “Well, I did shoot somebody. I am sorry, I have to pay for it. All I wanted was a divorce. She would not give me one. One year I want. She is having an affair. I want a divorce. I want to get on with my life.” 
        
       
      
    15 The accused told police that he had cut his wrists in an attempt at self-harm. The police took possession of a tape recorder and some brief notes written by the accused to the woman with whom he had been living, to his brothers and sisters and to his child.16 On the tape recorder was a recording of a fairly long monologue by the accused. Parts of the transcript of what the accused said are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t know how to say this, that, ah, a bit earlier I killed two people. I didn’t mean to, but um, when you’ve got a wife that you give the last twelve years to, at the end she wanted to kick me out, have an affair with her uncle and our families we have the futures. I don’t mind that, but if she divorced me before she had the affair, then I did give her two chances in the past to get a divorce. She doesn’t want a divorce. I’ve been separated for one year about and then I attempted suicide in the morning because I can’t handle this woman.” 
        
       
      
    17 Later in the monologue the accused made allegations against his mother-in-law and his father-in-law. Later still in the monologue he returned to the allegation that his wife had been having an affair with her uncle. The accused said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I only got one choice left in front of them which is to shoot the bastard. He’s wrecked my family, away from my daughter and my wife, he’s the one that divided my family and my wife if she didn’t agree to it, she wouldn’t have not come back.” 
        
       
      
    18 After he was arrested the accused was taken to a police station where an electronically recorded interview was conducted. At an early stage in the interview the police officer conducting the interview informed the accused that police would help the accused contact a lawyer of his choice, if he wanted legal advice.19 At question 57 in the interview the accused was asked what had happened the night before at 51 Coventry Street. The accused said that he would like to speak to a lawyer. The interview was suspended, the accused contacted a lawyer, and when the interview was resumed the accused said that he had been advised by the lawyer to say nothing and that he did not wish to say anything. Shortly afterwards the interview was terminated.20 The witness statements and the other evidentiary materials in the Crown brief clearly establish beyond reasonable doubt all of the elements of all of the offences charged, including that the acts of the accused were done voluntarily and with the intent required for each offence.21 Section 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “38 Special verdict 
         
         
        (1) If, in an indictment or information, an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made, then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act or made the omission charged, but was mentally ill at the time when the person did or made the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
         
         
        (2) If a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness is returned at the trial of a person for an offence, the Court may remand the person in custody until the making of an order under section 39 in respect of the person. 
         
        
       
      
    22 In the present case, of course, the accused elected to be tried by judge alone and I have the function of determining whether the accused was mentally ill at the time of performing the acts which are the subject of the charges. In determining this question, I am to apply the M’Naghten rules as stated by the House of Lords in M’Naghten’s case. (1843) 10 Cl&F 200 at 210; 8 ER 718 at 722 
     
      
    23 In M’Naghten’s case the House of Lords said: 
     
      
       
        
        “We have to submit our opinion to be that the jurors ought to be told in all cases that every man is to be presumed to be sane and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of the committing of the act the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.” 
        
       
      
    24 In the present case there is no suggestion that the accused did not know the nature and quality of his acts. However, it was contended that the accused did not know what he was doing was wrong. A person does not know what he is doing is wrong when he does not know that it is wrong according to the ordinary standards of right and wrong adopted by reasonable persons or cannot reason with some moderate degree of calmness as to the wrongfulness of the act. Stapleton v The Queen (1952) 86 CLR 358 at 367. The onus is on the accused to prove on the balance of probabilities the defence of mental illness.25 Dr Westmore, the psychiatrist retained by the Crown, has considerable experience in forensic psychiatry. He saw the accused on a number of occasions and prepared reports dated 15 March 2005, 6 April 2005, 12 September 2005, 31 January 2006, 28 October 2007 and 9 November 2007. Many parts of the reports were concerned with the question of the accused’s fitness to be tried and are not relevant, or not directly relevant, to the present issue.26 At p 2 of his report of 6 April 2005 Dr Westmore said under the heading “Psychiatric Diagnostic Issues”: 
     
      
       
        
        “Delusional Disorder. This is a provisional diagnosis only. In the absence of any evidence to indicate that the deceased and Mr Pham’s wife were in fact having an affair, then this is the most likely psychiatric diagnosis. Mr Pham appears to have fixed firmly held views that his wife was being unfaithful to him. There is a history that he repeatedly and consistently pressed her with allegations about her infidelity and although he stated to her that he had evidence, none was ever produced.” 
        
       
      
    27 At pp 4 and 5 of his report of 28 October 2007, Dr Westmore said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If I assume that his wife was not in fact having an affair with her uncle, as Mr Pham appears to believe in a very fixed and firm fashion, then it is likely those beliefs which apparently directly led towards his aggressive behaviour towards the deceased and towards his wife is of a delusional type. On the balance of probability this man suffers from either a delusional disorder or a paranoid schizophrenic illness. He is being treated with medication and he has for some time been managed in a psychiatric unit in prison. 
        
       
       
        
        I believe he suffers from a disease of the mind, specifically a psychotic illness which is likely to be a delusional disorder. He would have been totally deprived of his capacity to know or understand that he ought not to do the act when he attacked his wife and killed her uncle. Mr Pham would be eligible for a mental illness defence to the charge of murder and a mental illness defence to the charge of attempted murder.” 
        
       
      
    28 In his report of 9 November 2007 Dr Westmore, having been provided with further materials, said in part: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was nothing in the material that I could identify which would contradict the opinion that Mr Pham suffers from a delusional disorder or that as a result of that disorder he acted as he did towards the two victims. At times, patients who have mental illnesses act impulsively towards their victims as a result of delusional beliefs but on other occasions a great deal of time, planning and preparation takes place on behalf of the mentally ill person.  
        
       
       
        
        This is more likely to occur if the patient and the victim have regular contact or if they have had an extended relationship of an intimate or professional type. This scenario appears to apply in the case of Mr Pham. There is no evidence that the deceased Chi Cong Pham was having an affair with his niece, Joanne Ngo.” 
        
       
      
    29 Without any objection by counsel for the accused, the Crown Prosecutor asked Dr Westmore whether any of a number of factors would cause him to alter the opinion he had expressed in his reports that the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind being a delusional disorder, such that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. These factors included:  
     
      
       
      (1) the degree of planning manifested in the commission of the offences, including the obtaining of a weapon equipped with a silencer and ammunition and the use of an accelerant to set fire to the pharmacy shop; 
       
       
      (2) the conversations the accused had had at the time he was arrested; 
       
       
      (3) the contents of the accused’s confession recorded on the tape recorder; 
       
       
      (4) the accused’s attempts at self-harm; 
       
       
      (5) the notes written by the accused;  
       
       
      (6) the accused’s assertion of his rights when he was interviewed by police. 
      
    30 Dr Westmore replied that none of these factors would cause him to alter his opinion. Dr Westmore repeated what he had said in his reports, that a person who is mentally ill is capable of engaging in a great deal of planning for the commission of an offence, particularly when the mentally ill person and the proposed victim have been in a relationship.31 Dr Westmore drew a distinction between a person knowing what he was doing or had done was legally wrong and that he was liable to be punished, and a person knowing that what he was doing was morally wrong as is required by the second limb of the M’Naghten rules. In Dr Westmore’s opinion the accused, while he might have known that what he had done was wrong in a legal sense and that he would be punished for what he had done, did not know that what he was doing was morally wrong within the second limb of the M’Naghten rules.32 In Dr Westmore’s opinion, the fact that the accused had asserted his rights when interviewed by the police was quite separate from the issue of whether the accused was mentally ill.33 Dr Nielssen, the psychiatrist retained by the defence, has, like Dr Westmore, considerable experience in forensic psychiatry. Dr Nielssen saw the accused on a number of occasions and prepared reports dated 1 February 2005, 4 August 2005, 17 May 2007 and 23 October 2007. As in the case of Dr Westmore’s reports, many parts of Dr Nielssen’s reports were concerned with the question of the accused’s fitness to be tried and are not relevant, or not directly relevant, to the present issue.34 On p 6 of his report of 1 February 2005 Dr Nielssen said under the heading “Opinion”: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Pham meets the accepted criteria for the diagnosis of a delusional disorder as he held the fixed false belief that his wife was unfaithful to him for at least a year prior to the alleged offences. He has also experienced periods of significant depression, although his depression in the period after the onset of his delusional belief, appears to have been largely secondary to the belief and its consequences.  
        
       
       
        
        I believe Mr Pham has the defence of mental illness open to him as his behaviour was the result of a defect of reason in the form of a delusion of jealousy arising from a mental illness that is recognised in law as a disease of the mind. Mr Pham was aware of the nature of his actions but as a result of the interpretation of events, because of his delusional belief, he did not recognise that his actions were morally wrong. Moreover, his depressed state resulted in a morbid view of his situation that prevented him from reasoning with any measure of composure about the possible consequences of his actions.” 
        
       
      
    35 In his report of 17 May 2007 Dr Nielssen said that he confirmed the opinion expressed in his report of 1 February 2005 about the availability of the defence of mental illness.36 Dr Nielssen had been present in court when Dr Westmore had been questioned by the Crown Prosecutor. Dr Nielssen was in turn questioned by the Crown Prosecutor. Dr Nielssen was referred by the Crown Prosecutor to the high degree of planning in the commission of the offences, the notes written by the accused, the accused’s tape recorded confession, the conversation at the time of the accused’s arrest and the exercise by the accused of his legal rights when interviewed by the police.37 Dr Nielssen gave evidence that none of these factors would cause him to alter his opinion that the accused, because of his delusional belief that his wife was having an affair with her uncle, did not realise that what he was doing was morally wrong.38 The Crown Prosecutor in addressing the court referred to the common view of the two psychiatrists that at the time of committing the offences the accused, because of his delusional disorder, did not know that what he was doing was wrong within the second limb of the M’Naghten rules.39 The Crown Prosecutor said that he had raised with both psychiatrists matters which, at first sight, might suggest that the accused did indeed know that what he was doing was wrong but both psychiatrists had said that, notwithstanding these matters, they remained of the view that the accused did not know that what he was doing was wrong in the relevant sense.40 The Crown Prosecutor informed the court that in these circumstances he was not in a position to make submissions against my finding that a defence of mental illness had been established.41 Counsel for the accused submitted that the onus of proving that at the time of committing the offences the accused had been mentally ill had been discharged.42 As the tribunal of fact, I am not bound by the opinion of any expert witness or of any number of expert witnesses. However, where the expert witnesses called by the Crown and by the defence agree with each other, I should not reject the expert witnesses’ unanimous opinions, unless there is evidence before me which would cast doubt on those opinions.43 The attention of each of the expert witnesses was directed to matters which might at first sight seem inconsistent with their opinions and each of the expert witnesses said that those matters were not inconsistent with his opinion and did not cause him to alter his opinion.44 In these circumstances I consider that I should accept the psychiatric evidence. Accordingly, on each of the charges I find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness. It was common ground that, if I reached this verdict, I should make a further order, which I now make, that the accused be detained in a Correctional Centre or such other facility as the Mental Health Tribunal may determine, until released by due process of law.

     REGINA v Matthew Ryan THOMAS 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: This case involved an appeal brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) against two sentences imposed on the Respondent, the appeal being brought pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). For the reasons set out below, the Director has made good the contention that the sentences are manifestly inadequate. He has further made good the submission that this Court should properly intervene and that the Respondent should be resentenced. 
     
      
    First robbery 
     
      
    2 The first charge against the Respondent involved robbery in circumstances of aggravation with wounding, contrary to s 96 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The circumstance of aggravation (as identified in s 95(2)) was the use of corporal violence. That conduct resulted in the victim suffering wounds, which brought the matter within the more serious offence under s 96, carrying a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment. It is not, however, subject to a standard non-parole period: c.f. Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), Div 1A.  
     
      
    3 The offence occurred at about 8.30pm on 2 March 2005 at Parramatta. The victim, Mr Ciaron McCullough, was making a telephone call from a public phone booth. He had with him three large bottles of beer, one of which was open and from which he had been drinking. He was approached by Mr Thomas, who made some remark about wanting to use the telephone. The trial judge found that Mr Thomas had been in a red Ford Laser when he saw Mr McCullough and said to the driver:  
     
      
       
        
        “Stop the car, there’s a guy with a long-neck at the pay phone and I’m going to take it.” 
        
       
      
    4 What happened in the phone booth was in dispute, but his Honour found that “it was Thomas who scared the victim whilst at the box and caused him to run”: at [22]. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have no doubt that that was done through threats, abuse and striking him.” 
        
       
      
    5 Mr McCullough sought to run away carrying at least the two unopened bottles of beer with him. Whilst running, he was either tripped or struck from behind and fell. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “[26] I cannot be satisfied that the victim was struck with anything prior to falling to the ground as he claimed. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender struck the victim a number of times by kicking actions at a time when the victim was on the ground. ….” 
        
       
      
    6 Mr McCullough suffered a number of serious injuries. These included a 2.5cm laceration to the back of his head, with surrounding bruising. There was another head wound and a significant swelling over the nose, which had been fractured. There was also an injury to the right shoulder. Photographs taken at the time showed Mr McCullough with blood on his chest and shirt and blood was found on the clothing worn by Mr Thomas. 
     
      
    7 There was another young man with Mr Thomas at the time of the assault and the trial judge found that, whilst Mr McCullough was on the ground, both men “started belting into” him. His Honour continued at [19]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[McCullough] managed to hold the offender’s leg. As best I can tell, the offender then started kicking with his other leg. McCullough managed to hold onto both of this offender’s legs. Whether the offender panicked or whether he decided to end the situation then and there, he picked up the plastic bag containing the bottles of VB, swung them over his shoulder and hit [McCullough] in the back of the head with the bottles. He then picked up one of the VB bottles from the ground and he and [the other young man] retreated to the Ford Laser.” 
        
       
      
    8 The assault had been witnessed and police were informed by a member of the public. A short time later, the red Ford Laser was found in a service station and Mr Thomas was arrested. A bottle of beer was found in the back of the car and, as already noted, blood, which proved to be that of Mr McCullough, was found on Mr Thomas’ clothing. 
     
      
    9 His Honour noted at [30]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The [McCullough] robbery was an opportunistic response to seeing a drunken man alone with alcohol. In this robbery Thomas did take a leadership role in that he initiated the approach and the necessary episode of violence to commit the robbery at the phone booth. The proceedings [proceeds?] for this appalling level of violence amount to one bottle of beer.” 
        
       
      
    10 At [61], his Honour noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “He has expressed remorse for the [McCullough] robbery. He pleaded guilty to the offence, a plea based upon accepting responsibility for his offending conduct.” 
        
       
      
    11 This finding must be placed in its evidential context. At the time of his arrest on 2 March 2005, Mr Thomas told the police a story which was not only untrue but implausible. He claimed that the blood stains resulted from an injury he had suffered at work: there was no visible wound and the blood on the clothing proved to be that of Mr McCullough. He also told the police that he had been waiting to use the public phone and, on asking Mr McCullough how long he would be, had been assaulted and had had to defend himself. That story was also inherently implausible and incapable of explaining Mr McCullough’s flight and his pursuit of his victim. Mr Thomas also denied that there was anyone else with him at the time of the altercation and denied that he had taken anything from Mr McCullough. 
     
      
    12 After charges were laid, Mr Thomas did not plead guilty but was committed for trial by the Parramatta Local Court on 3 November 2005. The trial was fixed before the Parramatta District Court, to commence on 13 February 2006. A plea of guilty was entered on the date scheduled for the trial: at [68]. However, various factual matters remained in dispute, as a result of which it was necessary for the prosecution to call Mr McCullough as a witness. He was cross-examined by counsel for Mr Thomas. That evidence was given on 15 December 2006, at which time the young person who had been with Mr Thomas at the time of the offence was also called for the prosecution. Mr Thomas then gave evidence which was consistent with his story to the police and contained the following answers (Tcpt, p 30): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. As you were driving along or as being a passenger in the vehicle in Macquarie Street at Parramatta did something happen? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened? 
         
        A. I said, ‘Can you pull over so I can use the phone?’ and I got out of the car, [the young person] got out behind me, and I went over to use the phone and some person was in there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Just pause there. Prior to [the young person] leaving the car did you have any discussions with him? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he tell you that he was leaving the car? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you know why he left the car? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You went over to the phone booth? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened there? 
         
        A. I go to the man, I go ‘Could I use the phone please?’ and he goes, ‘I won’t be long.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Pause there. What happened next? 
         
        A. He goes, ‘All right then’. I waited for about five minutes and I go, ‘Are you going to be much longer, mate?’ and then he turned around, chucked a beer bottle at me, it landed right next to my foot, smashed, and then ran at me and punched me in the face and then as soon as that happened he ran straight across the road towards through the mall and-- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you do, if anything? 
         
        A. I didn’t do nothing at the time until I seen [the young person] chase after him and-- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you do? 
         
        A. I went after him as well. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you do that? 
         
        A. To be honest I don’t know, I was – I got hit in the face and something just went through my mind, just chase him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you catch up to him? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where was he in relation to you when you caught up to him? 
         
        A. Halfway through the mall towards Hungry Jacks. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was he on the ground? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you see how he got to the ground? 
         
        A. [The young person] knocked him over. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So [the young person] got to him before you did? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you see what [the young person] was doing? 
         
        A. Punching him and kicking him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you do upon arrival? 
         
        A. I come straight down and punched him about three or four times. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where? 
         
        A. In the face and he grabbed my arm and then he wouldn’t let go so I gave him another punch to the face and then he let go and then I ran. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you kick him at all? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Whatsoever? 
         
        A. Not at all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you see whether or not he was carrying anything? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You heard [the young person] say that you took hold of a plastic bag that contained bottles of beer, did you hear him say that? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that you swung it over your shoulder cricket ball bowling style and hit the man on the ground with it to the head, did you do that? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you do after you assaulted him? 
         
        A. I ran towards the car that was in Macquarie Street and opened the door, the back door, and jumped into it. Then [the young person] jumped in and then we drove off. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you have a bottle of beer in your hand? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    13 The matter was adjourned part-heard and came back before the District Court on 22 December 2006. At that stage, there was a foreshadowed application to withdraw the plea of guilty. Counsel then appearing for the accused sought an opportunity to consider the evidence given by the co-offender and the matter was adjourned to 25 January 2007. At that stage the application to withdraw the plea was itself withdrawn and Mr Thomas proceeded with his evidence. He was led through much of what he had said on the previous occasion with questions in the following form (Tcpt, p 4): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And you said on the last occasion, and do you still say that he turned around and chucked a beer bottle at you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And it landed next to your foot and smashed? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you still say he ran at you and punched you in the face? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    14 Mr Thomas also adhered to the statement that he had not swung the plastic bag with the beer bottles and hit Mr McCullough in the head but he did admit that he took a bottle of beer back to the car and that he intended to steal it, although he claimed not to recall that. He was cross-examined in relation to the key points of difference between the story he had recounted and the facts as described by the prosecution witnesses. He adhered to his evidence. 
     
      
    15 On 25 January 2007, under further cross-examination, he was asked by the prosecution (Tcpt, pp 16-17): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You’d accept that it was cowardly on your part, the attack on this man, when there were two of you assaulting him when he was on the ground? 
         
        A. Yes that’s right.” 
        
       
      
    In re-examination, the following evidence was led (Tcpt, p 19): 
     
      
       
       
        
        “Q. It was put to you that … it was cowardly for you to attack this man on the ground with two persons being involved, and you agreed that it was? 
         
        A. Yes I do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Would you normally act in this way if you hadn’t been drinking? 
         
        A. No not at all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you ashamed of having acted in this cowardly fashion? 
         
        A. Yes I am.” 
        
       
      
    16 The matter was again stood over part-heard until 16 February 2007, so that his former counsel could be present during any cross-examination as to the circumstances of his plea. Counsel did not fully explain his position, which he felt constrained from doing by ethical considerations. He did however state before withdrawing (Tcpt, p 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “But given the subjective material that will be tendered on behalf of Mr Thomas, which was obtained by my instructing solicitor, I must add, and now given to Mr Steel, one important feature of it, as your Honour will no doubt read, is that with respect to the facts of the trial he maintains his innocence. So I would not be in any way saying anything about remorse, contrition, facts and that sort of stuff.” 
        
       
      
    17 The matter was again adjourned and there was further hearing of the sentence proceeding on 23 February 2007, at which time he was represented by Mr Steel. Submissions were put in favour of acceptance of his evidence in relation to the disputed facts. After noting the evidence about the cowardly act, counsel submitted that “there is genuine remorse”: Tcpt, p 18. 
     
      
    18 The other evidence of remorse is recorded in a report dated 13 December 2006, prepared by a psychologist, Mr Peter Ashkar. Mr Ashkar reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “He accepts responsibility for the … offence. He tells me he was heavily intoxicated on bourbon when he committed this offence. … He also tells me he was in the company of antisocial peers at this time. He attributes his offending behaviour to his alcohol use at that time. 
        
       
       
       
        
        Matthew expresses considerable regret and remorse over his offending behaviour: ‘I was definitely in the wrong … . I’m sorry … I do feel bad for doing it … I’ve learnt my lesson … Never to get in trouble again … It’s just not worth it’.” 
        
       
      
    19 The failure of Mr Thomas to give evidence to that effect himself in the witness box; his continued adherence, through many days of hearing, to an implausible story which was disbelieved, but constituted a significant attempt to diminish his responsibility for the offence, and the fact that he committed a further serious offence less than a month later, all require consideration in assessing the genuineness of remorse and the extent to which his expression of remorse can mitigate an otherwise appropriate sentence. A finding of genuine remorse should not be made lightly, especially in circumstances where there are contra-indications. A sentencing judge should indicate the manner in which he or she has taken into account the possibility that expressions of regret may be triggered by the threat of incarceration. On the other hand, it is fair to say in the present case that his Honour accepted the genuineness of his attempts to overcome abuse of alcohol which would provide a basis for the conclusion that there was a genuine attempt to address an underlying cause of the violent behaviour. 
     
      
    20 The belated and equivocal plea was relied upon as a basis for a significant reduction in sentence. Apart from the finding of remorse, there must be a serious doubt in relation to the appropriateness of a 15% reduction for a guilty plea in this case: Judgment on sentence, at [88]. 
     
      
    21 The sentencing judge set out in careful detail the subjective factors derived from Mr Thomas’ history and circumstances. To some extent they were inconsequential and, to some extent peripheral, and need not be repeated. Suffice it to say, they were substantially favourable and revealed nothing adverse to his case. 
     
      
    22 It was common ground between the parties that both the trial judge and this Court were entitled to take account of the sentencing guideline promulgated in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [162] in relation to an offence of armed robbery under s 97, having the following characteristics: 
     
      
       
      (i) young offender with no or little criminal history;  
       
      (ii) weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; 
       
      (iii) limited degree of planning; 
       
      (iv) limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; 
       
      (v) victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; 
       
      (vi) small amount taken; 
       
      (vii) a late plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong prosecution case. 
       
      
    23 An offence of this kind, taking into account the factors noted, would justify a sentence of between four and five years. 
     
      
    24 It is clear that factors (i), (iii), (v), (vi) and (vii) could properly be treated as satisfied in the present case. Mr Thomas was a young offender, being approximately 20 years of age at the time of the offence, and had no criminal history. The amount taken was small and there was a late plea of guilty, the significance of which was limited not only by a strong prosecution case, but also by a continued dispute as to the seriousness of the conduct. The offence was described as opportunistic by the trial judge, which is a fair description of the circumstances in which it occurred. It may therefore be said that there was no planning, rather than planning in a “limited degree”. On the other hand, Mr Thomas sought support from another of the group in the car, in case he should be thwarted in his attempted robbery and also instructed the driver to remain ready to drive off, should a speedy escape be necessary. The victim was not in a vulnerable position (condition (v)) in the sense of being in a vulnerable occupation; he was however seriously affected by liquor and was alone, albeit in an area where there may have been other members of the public in the vicinity and after dark but not in the later hours of the night. Vulnerability caused by inebriation may not be in the same category as occupational vulnerability, but there was no finding, or suggestion, that Mr Thomas was conscious of the degree of inebriation of Mr McCullough, prior to the attack. 
     
      
    25 There remain considerations (ii) and (iv). Mr Thomas did not carry a weapon capable of killing or inflicting serious injury, but he did use the bag containing the full bottles of beer as a weapon in the course of the robbery. Further, there was actual violence of a moderately serious kind. No precise weighting of these factors is possible, but what must be placed in the balance is the fact that the offence with which Mr Thomas was charged carried a maximum penalty of 25 years, whereas the Henry guideline related to an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years. 
     
      
    26 The sentencing judge made express reference to the guidelines identified in R v Henry. In that he was correct. He chose a sentence of four years, which was at the low end of the range specified in Henry, but which was capable of justification on the basis of the subjective circumstances which he appears already to have taken in to account by that stage of his judgment: at [88]. His departure from the guideline involved a reduction of 15% for the plea of guilty. Variation from the guideline does not of itself demonstrate error. However, one element contained within the guideline was the effect of a late plea of guilty. This was not a case in which any additional reduction was called for: indeed, the lateness of the plea and the circumstances of continued agitation of the facts, together with his Honour’s disbelief of significant aspects of the testimony given by Mr Thomas should rather have required consideration as to whether any allowance at all was appropriate. Clearly the further reduction was not appropriate. The proper course was to impose a sentence of not less than four years imprisonment. 
     
      
    27 The next question involves the determination of a non-parole period in relation to this offence. The sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period of 18 months, with a balance of 23 months, the balance being 128% of the non-parole period. Pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the balance should not have exceeded one-third of the non-parole period unless the Court decided that there were special circumstances. In order to achieve an overall sentence of 48 months, absent special circumstances, a non-parole period of not less than 36 months is required. 
     
      
    28 His Honour made a finding of special circumstances at [76]-[78]. He relied on the fact that Mr Thomas was a young man, that it was his first period in custody and that his rehabilitation would be better advanced in a community setting. The factors included his change in attitude towards alcohol abuse, the existence of a supportive family, a good employment record and his apparent insight into his offending behaviour and its causes: at [60], [74], [75] and [78].29 It was not entirely clear whether the Director challenged the finding of special circumstances, although he did complain that various factors had been impermissibly taken into account twice. Nevertheless, there is no error demonstrated in relation to the finding and the power to vary the relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence was properly available to his Honour. 
     
      
    30 The question remains, however, whether the imposition of a custodial term of 18 months was justifiable in the circumstances. A custodial period constituting less than half the appropriate sentence itself requires justification. The obligation imposed by s 44(2) to provide reasons for the decision that there are special circumstances, when taken with the general obligation of a Court to give reasons for its decisions, should be understood as requiring some explanation of the reason for the degree of departure from the standard relationship, at least in the case of such a significant departure as that adopted in this matter. The objective elements of the offence indicate that a non-parole period of less than two years was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    31 There remains a question as to whether, in accordance with general law principles, the Court should exercise its discretion to intervene. It is appropriate to defer consideration of that question until the sentencing for the second offence has been addressed. 
     
      
    Second robbery 
     
      
    32 On 12 April 2005, less than six weeks after the first offence and whilst on bail, Mr Thomas was charged with robbery of a Mr Kandiah who was following a pedestrian path across Parramatta Golf Course when his journey was interrupted by four youths who robbed him. 
     
      
    33 The incident occurred whilst Mr Kandiah was walking home from work. He had progressed about 50 metres along the path when he saw four youths approach from his left a bench near the path ahead of him. Their appearance made him fearful and he had already taken out his mobile phone and dialled 000 to seek police help when one of the youths accosted him and asked him for a $2 coin. He said that he had no change. His Honour’s summary of the facts as found by him continued at [8] in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “8. The youth abused him using foul language and racial slurs. … 
        
       
       
       
        
        9. Another youth pulled the mobile phone from his hand … . There was a conversation to the effect that the Triple 0 was on the screen. … 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        11. Kandiah sought to continue walking on however the four youths were encircling him. He made no more than four to five metres. A youth grabbed his jacket. … He sought to push that youth away with his left hand. … The youth did not go away. Kandiah then pushed him harder driving that youth two to three metres back.” 
        
       
      
    34 There was then a conversation as to whether Mr Kandiah had hurt the youth by pushing him. The prosecution case, which it appears his Honour accepted, was that an aggressive exchange then took place between Mr Thomas and Mr Kandiah. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “13. The accused raised his right fist, drew it back and struck Kandiah in the cheek just below his left eye. Kandiah was dizzy, could see nothing and was knocked to the ground. In so saying I am not confident that he was knocked flat to the ground, but certainly to his knees. He tried to stand up after a moment or two. … He was rushed. … 
        
       
       
       
        
        14. He was pushed so that he fell to the ground. As he tried to get up he was kicked, he fell back to the ground, used his arms to protect his head. He was kicked along the right side of body. He had difficulty breathing. The abuse was continuing. One of the youths however was screaming, ‘Where’s your wallet, where’s your wallet.’ With all the noise going on another said, ‘Stop, he can’t hear you’. The demand for the wallet was repeated, Kandiah directed the youths to the briefcase. The briefcase was found and taken. … 
        
       
       
       
        
        15. The physical injuries to Mr Kandiah [… included] bruising and pain from being kicked over his body; the lining of the skin of his mouth and his cheeks and lips were all injured.” 
        
       
      
    35 Annexed to a victim impact statement received and considered pursuant to Part 3, Division 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, was a report from a clinical psychologist who concluded that Mr Kandiah was suffering “a severely depressed level of mood and severe anxiety” as a result of the attack. This passage from her report was set out by his Honour in his reasons at [44]. How it affected his Honour’s assessment of the seriousness of the attack in which Mr Thomas was involved is not clear. 
     
      
    36 Section 29(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act notes that the “absence of a victim impact statement does not give rise to an inference that an offence had little or no impact on a victim”. Although the Act does not provide how an impact statement is to be taken into account, it should be inferred that it is material upon which the sentencing judge can rely in determining the appropriate sentence. The relevance of that factor is expressly identified in s 21A(2) which identifies one aggravating factor as arising where “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”: s 21A(2)(g). Indeed, as stated by Spigelman CJ in R v Henry at [94]: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no doubt that impact on victims is an aspect of the seriousness of an individual offence.” 
        
       
      
    37 In R v Slack [2004] NSWCCA 128 at [60] Sperling J noted there is further implicit recognition of the entitlement of a sentencing judge to rely upon a victim impact statement in s 28(4), dealing with the use of a victim impact statement given by a family victim “in connection with the determination of the punishment of the offender”. It is unfortunate that the Act gives no greater guidance as to the appropriate use of such a statement, especially where untested, for the purposes of determining sentence. However, it will often be appropriate to give weight to a victim impact statement where the conduct of the offender is otherwise established beyond reasonable doubt and the statement is restricted to subsequent effects on the victim. There is some doubt in the present case as to what weight the sentencing judge gave either to the physical effects of the assault or its psychological sequelae. 
     
      
    38 The charge in relation to the robbery of Mr Kandiah involved robbery in company in contravention of s 97(1) of the Crimes Act. It was an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. Mr Thomas pleaded not guilty and was convicted following a trial in which it appears the primary issue was identification. The psychologist’s report tendered at the sentencing stated that he maintained his innocence in relation to this offence and “issues of remorse involving this offence were not canvassed for this reason”. 
     
      
    39 The sentencing judge recognised that targeting an individual when isolated and vulnerable was an aggravating circumstance of the offence: at [38]. He also recognised that it was an aggravating circumstance that Mr Thomas was on bail, granted on the understanding that he would be of good behaviour, when he committed the offence against Mr Kandiah: at [39]. 
     
      
    40 His Honour noted the racial slurs which accompanied the abuse of Mr Kandiah during the robbery, which he described as “unfortunate”. He was not satisfied, however, that Mr Thomas “was the person who made those slurs”. 
     
      
    41 Although his Honour appears to have accepted that it was Mr Thomas who confronted Mr Kandiah and accused him of hurting the youth who had grabbed him and would not leave him alone, and that it was Mr Thomas who struck the first blow, his Honour nevertheless concluded at [86]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have not ascribed a leadership role to the offender, nor can I find that he was responsible for any of the physical violence to Mr Kandiah once he was on the ground.” 
        
       
      
    42 The reasons for judgment on sentence deal with both of the offences under relevant headings. Thus, under the heading “Attitude to the offences” his Honour noted the expression of remorse in relation to the robbery of Mr McCullough at [61]. He continued, at [62]: 
     
      
       
        
        “62. It is likely he also privately regrets his involvement in the Kandiah robbery. Publicly he has not done so. Identification was the real issue in the trial. He sought to avoid legal responsibility and accountability for it by challenging the identification evidence. One can understand that because the consequence of a conviction must be imprisonment. 
        
       
       
       
        
        63. Even though he has sought to avoid legal responsibility, that does not mean he lacks insight into the offence or its causes, nor does it mean that he does not regret the injuries occasioned to Kandiah.” 
        
       
      
    43 As should be well-understood and was undoubtedly appreciated by the trial judge, no-one can be punished for refusing to acknowledge his or her guilt of a crime. However, refusal to accept the correctness of a jury verdict is likely to diminish, and may well destroy, the opportunity to obtain a degree of leniency on sentence which would follow from a genuine and profound sense of remorse which, where combined with a sufficient strength of character to avoid the likelihood that the offender will succumb to temptation when next it arises, will justify a significant reduction in the penalty otherwise appropriate. Speculation about private regret and its likely consequences can give little confidence to a sentencing judge that any significant diminution of sentence is appropriate. Rather, his factual finding in the present case was that, with the courage borne of superior numbers, Mr Thomas delivered an unprovoked blow which felled Mr Kandiah. Even an express statement of regret, given in evidence before the Court, would have required anxious consideration before being accepted as evidence of genuine contrition. That material was not available to the sentencing court in this case. 
     
      
    44 In determining the relative seriousness of the offences, his Honour concluded that the attack on Mr McCullough was “far more vicious than the attack upon Mr Kandiah”: at [85]. His Honour also relied upon the distinction in relation to a “leadership role” and might further have noted that the offence under s 97(1), in relation to Mr Kandiah, was subject to a lower maximum penalty than the robbery with wounding offence involving Mr McCullough. Nevertheless, it is necessary to identify some proper basis for departing from the guideline in R v Henry, which would have justified a sentence in the range of between four and five years. One possible point of distinction is that the cases considered in Henry, whilst dealing with a robbery under s 97(1), mainly involved an offensive weapon, rather than the alternative factor of being ‘in company’. On the other hand, the circumstance identified in the guideline, as already noted, was one involving limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof. This case involved significant, gratuitous and unprovoked violence, albeit without a weapon. Further, there was no plea of guilty. Given the objective circumstances of the case, the guideline should have been applied. Considerations which his Honour appears to have taken into account in mitigation of the offence, as noted above, should not have justified departure from the guideline. A sentence at the bottom of the range for this offence would also have been four years imprisonment.  
     
      
    45 The subjective considerations, including the likelihood of rehabilitation, which his Honour took into account were assessed by reference to matters such as his attempt to curb his alcohol abuse, which arose after the second offence. The fact that the second offence occurred whilst Mr Thomas was on bail on the first offence should have generated a real concern as to the appropriateness of a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Nevertheless, there was a justification for such a finding and it should operate equally in relation to the second offence as in relation to the first. The result will be a further non-parole period of two years, rather than the period of 18 months imposed by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    Totality 
     
      
    46 His Honour correctly stated that the overall sentence imposed on Mr Thomas had to reflect the “totality of criminality in both criminal events”: at [87]. That required that the sentences be served partly cumulatively. The first sentence was directed to commence on the day of sentencing, namely 30 March 2007. The second period commenced six months later, on 30 September 2007. Each being a non-parole period of 18 months, the six months accumulation resulted in a total compulsory custodial period, prior to eligibility for release on parole, of two years. 
     
      
    47 It is undoubtedly necessary to avoid a sentence which would have crushing effects, especially where it is the first custodial sentence imposed on an offender. However, a significant period of accumulation is required in order to respond appropriately to the two entirely separate and independent and violent robberies. On the facts as found by the sentencing court, each involved a level of personal violence which warrants a significant period of imprisonment. The effective custodial sentence should have been a period of not less than three years. 
     
      
    Other factors 
     
      
    48 There are three other matters which need to be considered in relation to the potential re-sentencing. The first concerns an affidavit declared by Mr Thomas on 23 August 2007 and tendered on the appeal. In relation to the first offence Mr Thomas stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “I pleaded guilty to the offence against Mr McCullough. I take full responsibility for the offence, continue to regret it and am embarrassed that it occurred.” 
        
       
      
    That evidence went no further than the evidence accepted by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    49 In relation to the second offence, Mr Thomas stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am very sorry that Mr Kandiah was abused and robbed and that he suffered physically and psychologically. Because I maintain that I was wrongly identified by Mr Kandiah and am innocent of the offence, I cannot in honesty express regret for my role.” 
        
       
      
    This statement also goes no further than the material noted above. If he had no involvement in the attack on Mr Kandiah, his sorrow at the harm suffered by Mr Kandiah is entirely irrelevant. 
     
      
    50 The third matter dealt with in the affidavit concerns his attempts to curb alcohol abuse. The genuineness of his intentions in that regard were accepted by the sentencing judge: the affidavit takes the matter no further. 
     
      
    51 The second further issue concerns a claim that, in relation to the robbery of Mr McCullough, issues of parity arise as between his sentence and that imposed on the young person who accompanied him in the assault, who received a suspended sentence of 14 months. That sentence included discounts for a plea and for assistance, prior to which the trial judge, Phegan DCJ, considered the appropriate sentence would have been two years imprisonment. The young offender was also charged with robbery in circumstances of aggravation with wounding, in contravention of s 96 of the Crimes Act. At the time of the offence, he was two days short of his seventeenth birthday. He was neither the instigator of the crime, nor was he the one responsible for the most violent aspect of the attack, namely taking the bag with the full bottles of beer and using it as a weapon to inflict a serious blow to the back of his victim’s head. Further, the sentencing judge in that case accepted that the offender was not merely youthful but immature and that he had made out “a very compelling case of both spontaneous, self-generated and permanent rehabilitation”. The assistance also no doubt confirmed his Honour’s satisfaction that it was a case in which the offender had experienced “genuine remorse”. 
     
      
    52 It may be accepted that the sentence imposed upon a juvenile co-offender is relevant and gives rise to a question of parity, as contended by counsel for the Respondent, in reliance on Regina v Cox [2004] NSWCCA 413 at [27]-[28] (Hislop J, Santow JA and Smart J agreeing) and R v Tran [2004] NSWCCA 6 at [13]-[17] (Buddin J, James J agreeing). This was relied on not merely to demonstrate that the sentence imposed was not manifestly inadequate, but also as a reason why this Court should not intervene in the exercise of its discretion in relation to an appeal by the Director. 
     
      
    53 While there is a significant discrepancy between the sentence now proposed in relation to the first robbery and that imposed on the younger co-offender, there was also a significant discrepancy resulting from the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. Indeed, the matters noted above in relation to which error was identified on the part of the sentencing judge in sentencing Mr Thomas, including the additional discount for the plea and the relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of the term, did not bear justification by reference to the sentences imposed on the younger person. There were, in any event, very substantial differences in their respective responsibilities for the attack on Mr McCullough. The question of parity does not properly prevent the proposed variation to the first sentence. 
     
      
    54 The third further matter concerns the appropriateness of intervention in the circumstances of the case. The relevant principles are well-established and have been frequently restated: see Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321, which concerned a prosecution appeal pursuant to a provision which imposed no restraint expressly upon the exercise of the power: see in particular at [62] (Kirby J). 
     
      
    55 The proposed sentences referred to above have been identified by reference to the low end of the appropriate range. It can therefore be seen that the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge were manifestly inadequate. Further, error has been identified in the manner of determining those sentences. It would not be mere tinkering to intervene. As noted by Kirby J in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [110]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although under s 5D leave to appeal against sentence is not required by the prosecution, the principle of restraint in allowing prosecution appeals against sentence is well entrenched. It has sometimes been explained by reference to the species of ‘double jeopardy’ that a prisoner uniquely faces in such an appeal. Whilst the facility of prosecution appeals is afforded to contribute to the desirable aim of consistency in sentencing, it is normal to require a clear or definite case of demonstrated appellable error before a prosecution appeal is upheld by a court of criminal appeal.” 
        
       
      
    56 Taking all these factors into account, the public interest in maintaining consistency in sentencing and ensuring that adequate sentences are imposed in relation to serious offences of personal unprovoked violence, justify intervention in the present circumstances. 
     
      
    57 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Allow the appeal and set aside the sentences imposed by Nicholson DCJ on 30 March 2007. 
       
       
      (2) In relation to the robbery with wounding committed on 2 March 2005: 
       
       
        
        (a) set a non-parole period of two years commencing on 30 March 2007 and expiring on 29 March 2009; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) fix a balance of the term in a period of two years commencing on 30 March 2009 and terminating on 29 March 2011. 
        
       
       
      (3) In relation to the robbery in company committed on 12 April 2005: 
       
       
        
        (a) set a non-parole period of two years to commence on 30 March 2008 and to terminate on 29 March 2010; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) fix a balance of the term of two years to commence on 30 March 2010 and to terminate on 29 March 2012. 
        
       
      
    58 The earliest release date for the Respondent is thus 29 March 2010. Nothing said above should affect the recommendation of the sentencing judge that the Parole Board consider an order sought by Dr Dalton of a Wayback Treatment Program: at [100]. 
     
      
    59 LATHAM J: I agree with Basten JA.  
     
      
    60 ROTHMAN J: The Crown appeals the sentences imposed on Matthew Thomas. Mr Thomas, a passenger with three others in a car, left the car, accompanied by one of his travelling companions, and approached, robbed and wounded Mr Ciaron McCullough. Mr McCullough, who had bought some bottles of beer, was doing no more than talking on the phone at a public phone booth at the time of the attack. Mr Thomas pleaded guilty to the aggravated robbery. 
     
      
    61 A little more than a month later, Mr Thomas, with three others, robbed Mr Vasanthan Kandiah who, quite innocently, was taking a short cut through Parramatta Golf Course and had travelled some 50 metres along a pedestrian path and was still some short distance from the Parramatta Rugby Union Club. To this robbery in company, Mr Thomas pleaded not guilty and was sentenced after a jury trial. 
     
      
    62 The Crown appeals on the ground that the sentences imposed, or the overall sentence imposed, are/is manifestly inadequate. In seeking to explain the manifest inadequacy, the Crown raises alleged errors in the exercise of the discretion on sentencing: 
     
      
    i. An excessive discount for the plea of guilty in relation to the aggravated robbery offence;ii. The excessive weight given to remorse on the same offence;iii. Disproportionate weight given to Mr Thomas's subjective circumstances;iv. The finding of remorse in relation to the robbery in company offence;v. The finding that no further personal deterrence was required;vi. The erroneous approach to accumulation; vii. The failure to accumulate sufficiently in order to achieve a sentence commensurate with the totality of the criminality involved; andviii. The failure to apply properly the guideline judgement in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. 
     
      
    The Sentences 
     
      
    63 The first offence, the aggravated robbery with wounding, carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. Mr Thomas was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months' imprisonment, commencing 30 March 2007 and expiring 29 September 2008 and a balance of term of 23 months, expiring 29 August 2010. 
     
      
    64 The second offence, robbery in company, carries a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment for which Mr Thomas was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months' imprisonment, commencing 30 September 2007 and expiring in 29 March 2009, with the balance of term of two years, expiring in 29 March 2011. 
     
      
    65 The overall sentence imposed was a non-parole period (for both offences) of two years' imprisonment, with an overall balance of term of a further two years. The term of imprisonment commenced on the day of the sentencing. 
     
      
    Principles on Crown Appeal 
     
      
    66 Crown appeals against sentence require the application of the ordinary rules relating to an appeal against a discretionary judgment together with particular rules relating, solely, to appeals by the Crown. 
     
      
    67 While the power reposed in either the DPP or the Crown to appeal a sentence under s.5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) has been described in a number of ways to emphasise its exceptional character, ultimately it is a power granted by the legislature that, while the Court may discourage its use on other than rare occasions, is available to the Crown; and, when such an appeal is filed, it must be dealt with in accordance with principle. Those principles have been summarised by Wood CJ at CL in a much cited passage in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42, which is cited in full in R v Prasad (2004) 147 A Crim R 385 at [27]. Those principles were summarised in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in  
        House v The King 
         (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge:  
        Lowndes v The Queen 
         (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown;  
        R v Tait 
         (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         (2001) 207 CLR 584; 76 ALJR 79 at [58] and [109]. 
         
        (b) Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare;  
        Malvaso v The Queen 
         (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere:  
        R v Baker 
         [2000] NSWCCA 85. 
         
        (c) A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle ‘for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons’: per Barwick CJ in  
        Griffiths v The Queen 
         (1977) 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  
        Everett v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299, 74 ACrimR 241 at 244;  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 321, 115 ACrimR 558, and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
        . 
         
        (d) The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal:  
        R v Allpass 
         (1993) 72 ACrimR 561,  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Papazisis 
         (1991) 51 ACrimR 242 at 247, and  
        Wong and Leung v The Queen 
         at [110]. 
         
        (e) A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court:  
        R v Holder and Johnston 
         (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence:  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         at para [62].” 
        
       
      
    68 To those principles one should add the statement in Dinsdale, supra, that the Court will have a “strong resistance” to tinkering with sentences.  
     
      
    69 To the application of the principles in House v The King ought to be added the injunction to appellate courts in the joint judgments of Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [26]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Judges of first instance should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is effected.” 
        
       
      
    It is these principles that must be applied in dealing with the matter now before the Court.  
     
      
    70 I have read the judgment in draft of Basten JA. With great respect, I do not agree with his Honour’s conclusions. For reasons that follow, I do agree that the sentencing judge is in error. With respect, I do not agree that the sentence proposed by his Honour Justice Basten is less than that which could have been imposed by a sentencing judge: R v Holder and Johnston, supra, at 256. I propose a sentence that increases the non-parole period by six months to two and a half years’ imprisonment and the head sentence by 12 months to five years. Such an adjustment is not tinkering and places the sentence, as required, at the lower end of the range available (Dinsdale, supra, at [62]), giving credence to the available findings of the sentencing judge. Were I sentencing afresh, different considerations would apply and, subject to the impression of Mr Thomas I may have gained from hearing and seeing him give evidence, an overall sentence more severe than that proposed by Basten JA may have been appropriate. But the sentence imposed on appeal should, in this case, “not represent the full measure of sentence which might have been imposed upon the convicted person at first instance”: R v Holder and Johnston at 256 (per Street CJ). Circumstances of Robbery Using Violence (The Phone Booth Robbery) 
     
      
    71 In order to deal with a number of the grounds of appeal the conduct of Mr Thomas that gave rise to each of the offences needs to be examined. The Phone Booth Robbery occurred on 2 March 2005. Mr Thomas was a passenger in a car with a number of other people. He saw Mr McCullough, who had just left the Parramatta Hotel with three bottles of long neck VB beer, walking to the phone booth, drinking from one of the bottles. Mr Thomas told the driver of the car to stop the car and said: ""There's a guy with a long-neck at the payphone and I'm going to take it"" and requested one of his companions to accompany him ""just in case it turns back on me"". 
     
      
    72 Mr Thomas went to the phone booth with the companion, pushed and shoved the victim, causing the victim to run across the road carrying a plastic bag with the other two bottles of beer, chased by Mr Thomas and his companion. The sentencing judge accepted that Mr Thomas had scared Mr McCullough at the phone booth by threatening, abusing and striking him. 
     
      
    73 The companion tripped Mr McCullough, who fell to the ground and dropped the plastic bag and beer. Mr McCullough had not been struck by anything before he fell. Once he was on the ground, Mr Thomas and his companion kicked Mr McCullough, causing Mr McCullough to grab Mr Thomas' leg, which, in turn, excited Mr Thomas to kick Mr McCullough with his other leg. 
     
      
    74 Mr McCulloch held both of Mr Thomas' legs whereupon Mr Thomas picked up the plastic bag containing the two bottles of beer, swung it over his shoulder, hitting the victim in the back of the head. Mr Thomas picked up one of the beer bottles and returned to the car with his companion, telling the others to drive off and displaying to them the beer bottle as the trophy for this unprovoked attack.75 During the attack, other members of the public informed the police in the mall who ran to the scene and saw Mr Thomas and his companion running, and then driving, away. They attended on Mr McCullough who was, by then, lying outside the Town Hall, blood on his face, neck, hands, shirt and leg, nose swollen, top and rear of his head lacerated. 
     
      
    76 The description of the car was broadcast and other police officers apprehended Mr Thomas, blood on his hands, shorts and shoes. He fabricated a story that he had hurt himself at work, but there was no wound apparent. Mr Thomas participated in an interview, denying the offence and later suggesting that the attack was self-defence. DNA testing matched the blood on Mr Thomas' left shoe to Mr McCullough. 
     
      
    77 Mr McCulloch was treated in hospital for his injuries. They consisted of a 2.5 cm laceration to the occipital area with a surrounding haematoma; a 1 cm superficial laceration to the parietal area; swelling to the nasal area; erythema to the right suprascapular area; swelling to the nasal area caused by a nasal bone fracture. 
     
      
    78 Mr Thomas was ""well affected"" by alcohol at the time of this attack. There was no pre-planning, the attack being an opportunistic response to seeing a drunken man alone with alcohol. Mr McCullough was also well affected by alcohol and was accordingly in a most vulnerable position. Mr Thomas led his co-offender and the level of violence administered was vicious to a level above that seen in many robberies. As well as the crime being further aggravated because it was done in company, the use of bottles to strike Mr McCullough and the targeting of the face and head were each aggravating aspects to the crime. 
     
      
    The Circumstances of the Robbery in Company (The Golf Course Robbery) 
     
      
    79 Mr Thomas committed this offence on 12 April 2005, while he was on conditional liberty for the earlier offence. It occurred at about 5:40 pm while Mr Kandiah was walking home from work. He shortened his journey by taking the path across the golf course from Argyle Street Parramatta. The path is approximately 150 m long and the attack occurred after about 50 m of the journey. Mr Kandiah saw four youths sitting on the bench to his left, next to the footpath. 
     
      
    80 The four youths, who included Mr Thomas, had gone to the golf course with the specific intent of robbing a pedestrian and, having seen Mr Kandiah, organised to ""close in"" on him and sit at the bench with the intent of committing the robbery. In this robbery Mr Thomas did not play a leadership role. The youths targeted Mr Kandiah because of his vulnerability and the isolation of the path. 
     
      
    81 Slightly intimidated by the youths on the bench and a little scared, Mr Kandiah dialled 000 as he was approaching the bench. He feared that the call had not been connected. As he approached the bench one of the youths asked for a two-dollar coin to which Mr Kandiah responded that he had no change. One of the youths, not it seems Mr Thomas, abused Mr Kandiah using foul language and racial slurs, he grabbed Mr Kandiah's jacket and continued swearing and abusing him. Another youth, perhaps Mr Thomas, pulled a mobile phone from Mr Kandiah's hand, noticed that 000 was on the screen and informed the others of that fact. 
     
      
    82 Mr Kandiah could smell alcohol and vomit on the breadth of the youth abusing him. He attempted to push the youth away with his left hand on four or five occasions. He did not succeed. Mr Kandiah then pushed him harder forcing the youth two or three metres back. One or more of the youths then used this push as an excuse for an exchange alleging that Mr Kandiah had hurt the youth, to which Mr Kandiah, understandably and very sensibly, apologised. Mr Kandiah was punched, became dizzy, could not see and fell to the ground on his knees. He cried out, tried to stand, faced the youths, but was rushed by them and driven back four or five metres. He unsuccessfully sought to put his arms in a defensive position to protect his head. He was grabbed and pulled, had his jacket stolen from him, was pushed to the ground and kicked. The youths stole his briefcase, which contained his wallet. Mr Kandiah made his way to Parramatta Rugby Union Club and reported the incident. 
     
      
    83 Mr Kandiah's injuries included bruising, pain from being kicked over his body, abrasions to the lining of the skin of his mouth, his cheeks and his lips. He has been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result. This was a joint criminal enterprise in which Mr Thomas participated. Once more, Mr Thomas was well affected by alcohol. The level of violence in the robbery was a prominent feature on which the sentencing judge commented. 
     
      
    The Grounds of Appeal 
     
      
    84 As earlier stated, while particular grounds are raised, the Crown submits that the overall sentence for both offences is too low. 
     
      
    85 The circumstances of the proceedings for the Phone Booth Robbery were that Mr Thomas pleaded guilty, gave evidence seemingly inconsistent with his plea, but, nevertheless, ultimately adhered to the plea. The timing of the plea was that it occurred on the day of the trial and there were factual issues resolved during sentencing that required the victim to give evidence. The discrepancies of fact were resolved against Mr Thomas. It seems he was too drunk to remember almost anything about the incident. His Honour discounted the sentence for the plea by a factor of 15%. 
     
      
    86 Notwithstanding the submission of the Crown that 15% is too great a discount, there is no error in such a figure. 
     
      
    87 Further, the submission of the Crown was that excessive weight was given to remorse in the above circumstances, but, that, too, discloses no error, if taken alone. That Mr Thomas could not remember but was prepared to accept responsibility was to his credit. 
     
      
    88 His Honour found that Mr Thomas displayed remorse for the Golf Course Robbery. For this, Mr Thomas did not plead guilty. Nor, it seems, did he express remorse. Rather, this finding of his Honour is based upon his Honour's perception of Mr Thomas during the hearing and the sentencing. It is essentially a finding based on demeanour and it would only be with great reluctance that I would disturb it. Particularly in light of the positive steps taken by Mr Thomas toward rehabilitation, I can accept his Honour's views in this regard. Further the trial was essentially concerned with Mr Thomas’ involvement in the attack; not whether the attack occurred, nor whether Mr Thomas was there. While that involvement was sufficient to give rise to a joint enterprise, it beneficially affected Mr Thomas’ culpability.  
     
      
    89 There is little doubt that Mr Thomas regrets the associations he then had, his abuse of alcohol and all that flowed from that course. It is for that reason, it seems, that his Honour considered there was no further need for personal deterrence. 
     
      
    90 The more substantive issues raised are intertwined. The Crown submits a failure to apply R v Henry, supra, properly. It also submits that the two offences ought to have been imposed with less concurrence to bring about an overall sentence more commensurate with the totality of the criminal conduct in question. 
     
      
    91 R v Henry was a guideline judgment dealing with a contravention of section 97 of the Crimes Act 1900. The offences for which Mr Thomas was sentenced were contraventions of section 96 and section 97 respectively. In each case the offence is an aggravated form of robbery. The guideline in R v Henry is therefore relevant. But his Honour referred to the guideline and applied it. Did he apply it adequately or appropriately? 
     
      
    92 Guideline judgments are not intended to establish some matrix of parameters, the existence or non-existence of which will lead to a mathematically justifiable outcome. The guideline judgment is another relevant guidepost in determining an appropriate individualised result. 
     
      
    93 However, the guideline in R v Henry sets, for the offender with those hypothetical characteristics, between four and five years' imprisonment as a head sentence. This range takes account of a 10% discount for plea and the fact that the offender is young. 
     
      
    94 His Honour is an extremely experienced sentencing judge and has not been shown to have erred on any question of fact. Nor has any failure to apply principle been demonstrated. Further, all necessary principles have been considered. 
     
      
    95 The sentence, however, is very light. It seems that the sentencing judge has implemented this quite deliberate sentence mostly on account of Mr Thomas’ youth, his rehabilitation, and his lack of relevant criminal history. All of these were factors to which the sentencing judge was entitled to have regard. They are matters on which this Court should give the sentencing judge's views great weight. These matters may properly impact both the sentence and the ratio between the non-parole period and the remainder of sentence. 
     
      
    96 It may be, given that the sentencing judge used a starting point of 4 years (the bottom of the range in R v Henry), that he has incorrectly applied a further 15% discount in circumstances where R v Henry already has built in a discount of 10% for plea. It is not absolutely clear what, if any, error has been committed. But, even in the unusual circumstances of this offence, this offender and the rehabilitation issues, these sentences are below the range available. 
     
      
    97 On balance, I consider the sentence imposed manifestly inadequate. I am required to fix a sentence at the lowest end, bearing in mind all of the factors mentioned. Further, I have regard to the evidence of continuing rehabilitation and I propose a sentence, which, I anticipate, will not interfere with that process. I continue to allow 15% discount for the plea on the first count, which is a further 5% on the lowest range in R v Henry, supra. I reiterate the finding of special circumstances. I adjust the second sentence to effect the overall ratio decided by his Honour below. 
     
      
    98 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) The Crown appeal against the sentences imposed on Matthew Ryan Thomas on 30 March 2007 be granted;

    SENTENCEIntroduction1 Belinda Campbell appears for sentence today after having been found guilty by a jury of committing an offence of importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor believing that another person would use the precursor to manufacture a controlled drug.2 What Mrs Campbell imported were approximately 2,000,000 commercial cold tablets weighing a total of 452 kg. Each tablet contained the precursor pseudoephedrine, a drug which is particularly desirable because of its potential use in the manufacture of the illicit drug methylamphetamine hydrochloride. The amount of pseudoephedrine in the tablets was 92.9 kg. The potential yield of methylamphetamine hydrochloride was more than 50kg with a value of between $10 million and $56 million. Mrs Campbell imported more than 70 times the commercial quantity of 1.2kg.3 Those figures alone demonstrate the objective seriousness of the offence for which Mrs Campbell is to be sentenced.4 The maximum penalty for the offence for which Mrs Campbell is to be sentenced is 25 years imprisonment.Facts5 For some years leading up to the commission of the offence Mrs Campbell ran a furniture retail business. She obtained her stock from Indonesia, utilising the services of a man by the name of Sam Rantasalu. It was necessary for her to periodically import shipping container loads of furniture and household goods for resale. Mr Rantasalu took care of the Indonesian side of things, in particular it was he who arranged the packing of the containers delivered to Mrs Campbell.6 On 17 June 2006 a container of furniture was delivered to Mrs Campbell’s business premises. It had been imported into Australia from Indonesia. The authorities were alerted to the presence of things other than the furniture in the container when the container was X-rayed and an anomaly found. By the time it was delivered to Mrs Campbell there was a well organised operation in place involving surveillance of that container, Mrs Campbell and Mr Campbell. 7 At one end, the end furthest from the doors to the container, the X-ray had revealed the presence of items which were not furniture or household goods. Further investigations of that anomaly by the authorities revealed that the container had within it many boxes of Sudafed and Actifed tablets. These tablets contained pseudoephedrine which is a border controlled precursor. The evidence established that pseudoephedrine was a very much sought after drug by those who wish to produce methylamphetamine or methylamphetamine hydrochloride.8 In those circumstances a controlled delivery proceeded, with many officers from both the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Federal Police performing surveillance duties. What they observed was that after the container was delivered to Mrs Campbell’s business premises, Mrs Campbell, her husband, and others, began to remove some or all of the furniture and household items from the container. By the time they had finished work on the day the container was delivered the packages containing the commercial cold tablets had not been removed. They remained in place in the container until a Mr Baka arrived, together with another man, in a truck the following day. With Mr Campbell and the other man, Mr Baka removed the boxes of Sudafed and Actifed tablets from the container, put them in the truck and drove away. Mr Baka was arrested shortly after, as were Mr and Mrs Campbell.9 The evidence established that this importation of pseudoephedrine by the offender was at least the 3rd such importation. There was a history of Mr Rantesalu placing pseudoephedrine tablets in the containers he packed, with the offender being well aware of what he was doing.The Proceedings10 The trial began as a joint trial involving not only Mrs Campbell, but also her husband and Mr Baka. However, for reasons that are not important now (but which can be found in my judgment published on the Caselaw database on the internet) I directed verdicts of acquittal in relation to Mr Campbell and Mr Baka. The trial continued against Mrs Campbell alone.11 When the verdict was announced there was a significant disturbance. Mrs Campbell’s many supporters were clearly surprised by the verdict. I ordered one man to leave the courtroom after he began shouting at the jury that they were a disgrace. Others were shouting out as well. The jurors were visibly shocked and upset by the vocal reaction of so many people. 12 In view of what occurred I propose to say something about the verdict returned by the jury. I wholeheartedly agree with the jury’s verdict. In my opinion any person who heard the evidence, and then considered it from a dispassionate point of view, would have agreed with the jury’s decision. Only those who looked at things through rose coloured glasses could have been surprised at the outcome of the trial. The evidence against Mrs Campbell was compelling, in particular her recorded interview with police was significant evidence pointing to her guilt.13 During her evidence Mrs Campbell attempted to explain how some of the most incriminating answers in that interview could have a more innocent explanation. Those attempts were most unconvincing. I have no hesitation in accepting that Mrs Campbell was being honest and accurate in her interview with police and that acceptance of her evidence in court would have involved acceptance of propositions which were unbelievable to the point of being fanciful.Mrs Campbell’s Criminality14 In assessing the sentence to impose on Mrs Campbell I have to determine the extent of her criminality.15 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that although the offender did not wish Mr Rantasalu to place extra boxes in her shipping containers, she came to accept it as a necessary evil. As she explained to police: she needed to run her business; to do that she needed to import furniture; and to do that she needed to use Mr Rantasalu’s services. 16 He took advantage of the offender’s need for his services but the offender knew full well what she was doing and recognised that what she was doing was wrong, accepting it as the price she had to pay in order to keep her furniture business going.17 As she told police: 
     
      
      Sam is integral to my business as well, um, because it sort of started from the ground up that he knows all the suppliers. He organises as I said… a fairly big logistic operation which I wouldn’t be able to do. 
      
    18 Consistent with the jury’s verdict I am satisfied that the offender knew that there was a substantial risk that what Mr Rantasalu had placed in the container on this occasion were tablets containing pseudoephedrine. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the reason that the offender had this belief was because he had done so, to her knowledge, on at least 3 previous occasions. 19 My findings of fact are largely based on an acceptance of what the offender told police during her record of interview. Mr Bromwich submitted to the jury that they should not accept what Mrs Campbell said to police at face value, recognising the highly incriminating nature of many things that Mrs Campbell said. I do accept what Mrs Campbell said at face value. The Crown submitted to the jury that Mrs Campbell was largely telling the truth in that interview. I am satisfied that that is the case.20 As I have explained, the offender’s role was a reluctant one and I will sentence her on the basis that she received no benefit from her offence apart from the ability to continue using Mr Rantasalu and thus keep her business running. 21 Again, as she told police: 
     
      
       
      The only thing I’ve gained is that my business has kept running, that’s – that’s what I’ve gained from it and that’s what I guess I feared in terms of that, um, changing and whatever.  
      
    22 This is a case where the offender is to be sentenced for her role in a drug importation enterprise where she would have preferred not to have played any role at all. But not too much weight should be placed on this factor. Many people, from drink drivers to murderers, would prefer not to commit any crime, but they do so for the advantage it brings. In this case Mrs Campbell was prepared to involve herself in criminal activity of a most serious kind for personal gain. 23 I am prepared to accept that she tried to stop Mr Rantesalu putting contraband in her containers, but these attempts were perfunctory, consistent with her attitude that she needed him to operate her business.24 The Crown asked me to accept that were it not for the intervention of police the importations would have continued into the future using some other means to bring pseudoephedrine into Australia. The Crown relied primarily on a statement made by Mrs Campbell to Mr Rantasalu recorded by police when Mrs Campbell’s telephone calls were being intercepted. The statement was: “we have to sort something else to do”, that being said in the context of a conversation where both of them were discussing how lucky they were not to have been caught on this occasion. 25 I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, despite grave suspicions to the contrary, that what Mrs Campbell meant by that statement was that she was planning to involve herself in more importations. I make this finding primarily because of Mrs Campbell’s attitude, as revealed in the evidence, towards the importation of the precursors. She was prepared to accept what Mr Rantasalu was doing was the price she had to pay for doing business with him, but there is nothing to suggest that she would have independently involved herself in importations of that drug if they weren’t connected with the importation of furniture for her retail business.Subjective Factors26 The offender is now 45 years of age. She has 4 children, 2 of whom are still at school. She has been married to her husband for 23 years. They had a fifth child who died in 1992 at 2 years of age. After completing her HSC and then her tertiary studies she worked as a pharmacist until her husband accepted a job in Indonesia. She and the other members of the family then travelled to Indonesia where they lived for a number of years. It was there that she met Mr Rantasalu. On her return to Australia she used her connections with Mr Rantasalu to start the furniture importing business. 27 She has no criminal convictions and many references were tendered attesting to her qualities as a human being, and in particular as a mother. One qualification to her prior good character concerns the circumstance that this importation for which she is to be sentenced today was the fourth importation of tablets containing pseudoephedrine. Thus she is not to be sentenced as though this offence was an isolated incident. 28 The references all suggest that Mrs Campbell has learnt her lesson and that she is unlikely to commit any further offence in the future. Those expressions of opinion would be easier to accept if Mrs Campbell was prepared to acknowledge her guilt. She maintains her innocence. She maintains that she believed that the extra packages contained cigarettes, a lesser form of contraband than tablets containing pseudoephedrine. Most if not all of the references tendered on her behalf also suggested that Mrs Campbell was innocent. It is a matter of speculation as to whether any of the referees would have expressed a different opinion had they been of the view, which I have no hesitation as accepting as accurate, that Mrs Campbell is guilty as the jury has found her to be. Consideration29 An important factor in determining the offender’s criminality concerns the quantity of drugs imported and the potential quantity of narcotic drugs that could be produced. That is why I began these remarks on sentence by setting out the enormous quantity of methyl amphetamine which could be produced from the tablets in Mrs Campbell’s container.30 Although there was a significant quantity of drugs involved in this enterprise, that circumstance must of course not be permitted to overwhelm all other relevant factors in the sentencing exercise. That is the case for every offence of this nature, but particularly so in this case where the evidence would tend to suggest that Mrs Campbell was unaware of the size of the importation. As I recall the evidence Mrs Campbell was not present when the boxes were left in the container after the furniture was removed, nor was she there when they were collected by Mr Baka and the other man. It’s also apparent that the quantity involved was not a matter of concern to her because there is nothing to suggest that she became aware that the authorities had not put back all of the boxes in the container which they had taken out as part of the controlled delivery. 31 It is also to be noted that this offence can be committed in 2 ways depending on the state of mind of the offender. The offence is proved if Mrs Campbell knew that there were tablets with pseudoephedrine in them inside the container, but also if Mrs Campbell was aware of a substantial risk that there were tablets with pseudoephedrine in them inside the container and in the circumstances known to her it was unjustifiable for her to take that risk by importing the container. 32 I will not sentence Mrs Campbell on the basis that she knew that there were tablets with pseudoephedrine in them inside the container but in the circumstances of this case there is not a great deal of difference between Mrs Campbell’s level of recklessness and knowledge.33 I repeat that there had been 3 containers imported by Mrs Campbell, before the one the subject of this charge, which to her knowledge had pseudoephedrine in them. So her awareness of the risk that there would be tablets in this container is awareness of a very high risk – one that approaches certainty. 34 It was said by Mr Bromwich that the offender did not have the “insight” to abandon her importing business. That tends to suggest that her decision to continue on importing containers with pseudoephedrine in them was an unconscious one. I do not accept that at all. I accept that Mrs Campbell was troubled by the implications of continuing to business with Sam Rantasalu but she nevertheless consciously decided to carry on, accepting both that the pseudoephedrine would be used to manufacture methyl amphetamine, and the risk of being caught.35 Mr Bromwich asks that I find his client was contrite and remorseful. I have no doubt that she is very sorry for the position she finds herself in, and the position she has put her children and husband in by her wrongdoing. But in the absence of an acknowledgment of guilt it is difficult to accept that the offender is remorseful as that term is traditionally regarded for the purposes of sentencing. In particular if I ignore the effect of my sentence as a personal deterrent for the moment, I am not satisfied that, given her time again, she would act any differently.36 However, when the effect of my sentence upon Mrs Campbell is taken into account, I am satisfied that she is most unlikely to commit any further offence, at least of this seriousness, in the future. The experience which she has undergone since her arrest last year, and the punishment she will necessarily undergo after I sentence her today will be a powerful reason for her to commit no further offences in the future. 37 I will take into account that Mrs Campbell gave a candid and detailed account of her dealings with Sam Rantasalu and was honest with police when she spoke to them. It may well be that such assistance never comes to anything, at least insofar as Mr Rantasalu is concerned, but I do accept that Mrs Campbell did give moderate assistance to police soon after her arrest.38 I will also take into account the way the trial was conducted, presumably on Mrs Campbell’s instructions. This trial was unusual in that very few of the primary facts were in dispute, what was in dispute were the inferences that could be drawn from those primary facts. The trial was considerably shorter than it might otherwise have been as a result of Mrs Campbell’s concessions which were made by way of agreed facts and limited cross-examination. 39 I take into account Mrs Campbell’s health. Tendered in the trial, and also on sentence, was evidence regarding some aspects of her medical history, in particular her difficulties with anxiety over the years. This will make her time in custody harder than would be the case with a person who does not suffer from such a disorder but it has to be recognised that the evidence tended to suggest that her anxiousness at present is not so much due to anything particular to Mrs Campbell, but results from her present predicament, something which is common to almost all those who are to be sentenced for serious drug importations. 40 A large number of the references spoke about the hardship which will be occasioned to Mrs Campbell’s children and her husband through her incarceration. I don’t wish to minimise the consequences for her children when I say that although terribly sad, such consequences are commonplace. Many parents are sent to gaol and as a result many children suffer. There is nothing in the material before me to suggest that the hardship to third parties in the present case is exceptional. That means that I can only take the hardship into account to a limited extent and certainly not to the extent where I can substantially reduce the sentence that I would otherwise have imposed.41 Mr Bromwich made a submission that when I consider the question of general deterrence what I should do is impose a sentence which would deter others in Mrs Campbell’s position from committing offences of this nature. I do not regard general deterrence as limited in that way. I regard the imposition of a sentence which contains within it a component of general deterrence as being one which reflects generally the community’s attitude towards drug offences and which reflects generally the need to deter others who may decide to import pseudoephedrine whatever role they play. 42 I recognise that this does not necessarily mean that harsh sentences should be imposed in all drug importation cases. The ultimate purpose of sentencing is to protect the community and sometimes this is best achieved through a lenient sentence, one which promotes rehabilitation rather than one which has as its forefront other purposes of sentencing such as general deterrence. However there is no need to promote Mrs Campbell’s rehabilitation for the reasons I have earlier identified and there is very much a place for imposing upon her a sentence which reflects the objective seriousness of her misconduct.43 Sentencing a person such as Mrs Campbell for a serious offence like this is never easy but it is made harder because of the absence of other sentences for similar offences. The Crown was unable to provide me with much assistance at all by way of comparable cases, (I mean no criticism of the Crown at all when I say that) and thus was forced to rely on sentences for importing illicit drugs as opposed to precursors. There are a number of differences between those offences and offences involving precursors and I am prepared to accept that a person who imports a precursor to be converted to illicit drugs by another person does not bear the same moral culpability as a person who imports the illicit drug itself ready for distribution. 44 I should specifically mention one submission made by the Crown and that was that this offence was increasingly prevalent. There is no evidence to that effect, nor does the difficulty which the Crown had in obtaining comparable cases support the Crown submission.45 In Commonwealth cases the usual ratio of non-parole period to head sentence is in the region of 60% to 66.6%. Despite Mr Bromwich’s submission to the contrary I can see no good reason for departing from what is usual in this case. The matters suggesting leniency in the offender’s case have already been taken into account by me in setting the head sentence and it would be double counting to reduce the non parole period because of those same factors.Sentence46 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a head sentence of 2 ½ years to have commenced on the day the offender went into custody which was 24 August 2007. She is to be released after serving a period of 18 months, that is on 23 February 2009 upon condition that she enters into a recognisance in the sum of $1,000 to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months and to appear if called upon to do so at any time in respect of any breach which may be committed within that period.Explanation47 Now, I have to explain to you Mrs Campbell what I have just done. I have ordered that you serve a period in custody of 18 months from which you will be released on 23 February 2009. For the following 12 months you will be on a bond to be of good behaviour and if you breach that bond you will be returned to custody until your total sentence of 2 ½ years expires.

    1 MASON P: The appellant challenges her conviction on the sole ground that the verdict was unreasonable having regard to the evidence. The charge was one of supplying heroin and the quantity involved (9.4g) was such that proof of possession deemed the possessor to be a supplier (see Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, s29). 
     
      
    2 In R v Amanatidis [2001] NSWCCA 400, 125 A Crim R 89 Giles JA summarised the applicable principles as follows (at [9]): 
     
      
       
        
        Possession of a thing in the criminal law involves physical control or custody of the thing plus knowledge that you have it in your control or custody ( 
        He Kaw Teh 
         (1985) 157 CLR 523 at 537-539, 546, 585-587, 599-600; 15 A Crim R 203 at 212-214, 219, 248-259). The physical control or custody may be shared, but must be control or custody to the exclusion of other persons or persons other than those with whom it is shared ( 
        Dib

    3 In the present case, the heroin was found by police during a search by warrant of a home unit at North Gosford that was conducted at about 6:30pm on Sunday 8 January 2005. The summing up indicates that it was common ground at the trial that the sole occupier (in the legal sense) of the unit at the time was Lorraine Studeman, the appellant's aunt. She had given evidence that she alone lived at the unit. Other persons, including the appellant, came to the unit at various times (often to obtain drugs) but it was not shown that they did so otherwise than as Ms Studeman’s invitees. 
     
      
    4 The heroin was discovered in a locked blue box found in a wardrobe in Ms Studeman's locked bedroom. Ms Studeman gave the police access to the bedroom by using a key on a chain around her neck to open the bedroom door. She told the police at the time that, as far as she knew, the box belonged to “Marie”, ie the appellant. This probably explains why the box was not opened until it was brought back to the police station later in the evening in question. 
     
      
    5 The contents of the box included 9.4g of heroin, $9,875.50 in cash, two cheques in favour of the appellant, four receipts from a jeweller in the appellant's name, and other items (including jewellery) that could not be sourced to anyone's ownership or possession. 
     
      
    6 The Crown established to the satisfaction of the jury a circumstantial case that the appellant possessed the contents of the box, the heroin in particular. In doing so, the jury rejected the primary defence case which was that Ms Studeman owned and/or possessed the heroin. In framing the issues of this way, I am of course not overlooking the onus that lay upon the Crown throughout. 
     
      
    7 Among the Crown witnesses were Ms Studeman and the appellant's son, Gary Smale. Each witness was declared unfavourable and permitted to be cross-examined by the Crown prosecutor. The Crown invited the jury to disregard aspects of their evidence that were exculpatory of the appellant and inconsistent with statements each had previously made to the police. 
     
      
    8 The appellant was arrested on 27 March 2005. Upon arrest she exercised her right of silence and she did not give evidence at the trial. 
     
      
    9 The nub of the Crown case linking the appellant with the blue box and its contents may be summarised in four points. 
     
      
    10 First, the appellant had ready access to the unit including her aunt's bedroom. There was a dispute as to whether the appellant was sleeping at the unit at the relevant time, but she was shown to have come there at various times shortly prior to the police raid. She had been seen at the unit by an estate agent during an inspection some time in the recent past. Ms Studeman said that she had stayed at the unit on occasions. Some of the clothing and other belongings in the aunt’s bedroom belonged to her. These included two bottles of methadone in her name issued on 2 January 2004 for use on 3 and 4 January 2004 that were found there during the raid. Diclocil Capsules sold by a chemist to the appellant on 30 December 2004 were found on the kitchen shelf at the unit. 
     
      
    11 The premises had been under police surveillance since late 2004 and the appellant had been seen near the unit on 6 January 2005. She was also seen by a police officer on 8 January 2005 as a passenger in a car driven out of the underground car park at the unit within about half an hour of the police arriving to execute the warrant.  
     
      
    12 Second, the two cheques found in the box were made out to the appellant (in the name ""M Davies""). They had been issued by the Central Coast Leagues Club on 7 January 2005, the day before the raid, in the amounts of $1500 and $1400 respectively. They were still attached to A4 size documents containing details as to time and source. The appellant was further linked to those cheques by evidence that she had gone to the Leagues Club on in 11 January 2005 seeking to have the Club issue replacement cheques, presumably on the basis that the originals had been lost and that payment was to be stopped at her request. 
     
      
    13 Third, there were the jeweller's receipts in the box. These had been issued to the appellant (in her married name ""Marie Smale"") by a Tuggerah jeweller. One receipt is dated 27/11/04 in respect of the repair of an item of jewellery. Another is dated 27/11/04 in respect of a layby sale of jewellery. Two are dated 1/12/04 apparently in respect of other sales. Two further receipts from the same jeweller were found in the appellant’s possession when she drove out of the unit shortly after the raid. 
     
      
    14 Fourth, there was evidence of Ms Studeman that would have decreased the likelihood of her being the owner of the box and increased the likelihood that it was the appellant. Ms Studeman said in her evidence at the trial that she did not know who owned the blue cash tin although she had seen it at various times at the unit. After she had been declared an unfavourable witness, she was cross-examined about what she had told the police during the search. The videotape of the search was put to her and it was tendered into evidence. A police officer asked her who owned the box. Her answer was “As far as I know, Marie”. She also told the police that she did not have a key to the box.  
     
      
    15 This portion of the videotape was put to her in cross-examination. She did not squarely admit it but was not really able to deny it. She said that the words “As far as I know, Marie” were directed to ownership of the methadone. It was open to the jury to reject this part of her sworn testimony. 
     
      
    16 Another part of Ms Studeman’s evidence exculpatory of the appellant was shown to be highly questionable. This in turn would have impacted adversely upon that witness’s credibility as a whole. Ms Studeman gave evidence that the Leagues Club cheques found in the blue box had been handed to her by the appellant late in the afternoon between 5.30pm and 6.30pm on the Wednesday, Thursday or Friday prior to the raid. She said that her niece told her she had won the cheques and asked her to hang onto them. Ms Studeman said that the cheques were normal size and she folded them in three before placing them in her wallet. She did not say how it came about that they were found in the box. There were two discrepancies in this evidence: The second cheque was proved not to have been issued until 8.04pm on the eve of the raid. And both cheques in the box were attached to an A4 size document. 
     
      
    17 The jury must also have rejected most of the evidence of the appellant’s son, Gary Smale. He said that he put his property into the second bedroom at the unit. He had seen the tin in the kitchen, in the loungeroom and in the dining room and being taken into the main bedroom by Karen Pegg, the woman from whom he claimed to have hired the room. He thought that the tin could have belonged to Karen Pegg or her son, Jason Pegg. He had seen the tin opened and that it contained heroin, money and some paper work. People used to go to the unit to score heroin.  
     
      
    18 Mr Smale was later declared to be an unfavourable witness. He was asked about the statement he provided to Constable Myers on 17 May 2006 in which he said he knew nothing of the tin or its contents and that he had never seen it in his life. He agreed that he had said those things and that he did not know at the time that his mother had been charged. 
     
      
    19 In subsequent cross-examination by defence counsel he said that he had frequently gone to the unit to obtain heroin. On some of the occasions he had seen the blue tin opened in the kitchen by Karen Pegg. Other persons had also been supplied heroin by that person in return for cash, jewellery and hock shop tickets. Mr Smale said that he had never had access to the tin except through Karen Pegg. Nevertheless, he agreed with the suggestion in cross-examination by defence counsel that it was “not impossible” that the heroin in the tin on 8 January 2005 was his (Tr 03/10/06, p10).  
     
      
    20 Later, having been given a certificate under s128 of the Evidence Act, Mr Smale said that he used to buy large quantities of heroin from Karen Pegg some of which he left in safe keeping in the tin that she controlled. He also said that he gave Karen Pegg some cheques of his mother’s winnings as well as some lay-by dockets. 
     
      
    21 Mr Smale was asked: (Tr 3/10/06 p23:47-52) 
     
      
       
      Q. … in relation to your previous position that you had no knowledge of the cash tin, why is it that you have changed your evidence today? 
       
       
      A. I just felt guilty about my mum being charged, and going to prison for the heroin where she had nothing to do with it when it was mine. 
       
      
    22 Mr Smale’s evidence would not have helped the appellant’s case. It is scarcely relied upon in this Court. His original sworn evidence about the ownership of the tin was effectively neutralised by the evidence as to what he had previously told the police on that topic. And his belated claim to have been the owner of the heroin found by the police would, with justification, have been viewed by the jury as an ineffectual attempt to assist his mother. 
     
      
    23 Mr Smale’s evidence about “Karen Pegg” had to be further assessed by reference to the testimony of a Crown witness, Christina White. She said that she had used the false name of Karen Pegg to lease the unit in September 2003. She had made up the name of “Anne Davies” as a referee for her lease application with the real estate agent. She said that when she moved out of the unit a few weeks later Lorraine Studeman moved in straight away and thereafter paid her rent. She denied having taken out the lease to assist the appellant, whom she described as an acquaintance of seven or eight years. 
     
      
    24 This evidence would scarcely have assisted the appellant. No one suggested to Ms White that she had supplied heroin from the premises. Indeed, her testimony that she had moved out within weeks of September 2003 severely undermined Mr Gary Smale’s evidence that “Karen Pegg” was the person controlling the blue box and its contents in January 2005. 
     
      
    25 The inability of the Crown to prove the ownership of various items in the blue tin was also invoked, together with the evidence of Ms Jasmine (discussed below), to show that the Crown did not exclude the reasonable possibility that the heroin itself belonged to someone other than the appellant.  
     
      
    26 In my opinion, the lack of evidence as to ownership of the miscellaneous items in the tin was simply neutral.  
     
      
    27 Nor do I think that the evidence of the defence witness, Ms Jasmine ought to have required the jury to have a reasonable doubt as to guilt. She testified to having seen the blue box open and under a coffee table in the lounge room of the unit on an occasion between December 2004 to early January 2005. She said that it was not her tin. She did not have a good look at it but she observed that it contained “pieces of paper, something in plastic bags”. There were other people at the unit at the time but the appellant was not one of them. 
     
      
    28 This evidence is said to support the possibility that the box was used by various persons who were drug users to secrete valuable items. 
     
      
    29 Under cross-examination, Ms Jasmine agreed that the first time she had been asked to recall the event was in about mid 2006. She agreed that she first met the appellant in December 2004 over the days when she was staying in the unit.  
     
      
    30 The jury may or may not have been impressed by this witness. But the content of her evidence did very little to take the appellant out of the spotlight. 
     
      
    31 In final addresses to the jury the prosecutor drew attention to the absence of evidence from Ms Jasmine that she saw heroin in the tin. Reliance was also placed upon the time lapse between the event in question and the time when the witness was first apparently called upon to recall the matters. 
     
      
    32 I do not think that Ms Jasmine’s evidence cast real doubt about the appellant’s ownership of and/or exclusive access to the blue box with its valuable contents at the critical time when the police searched the premises. 
     
      
    33 I conclude that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. I am not persuaded that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt as to guilt. The appeal should be dismissed.

    JUDGMENT1. Mr Watson for Mr Mikel Fajloun applied to discharge the jury. This application was made on 7 November 2007. The basis of the discharge was evidence given by KF. 2. The evidence was given on 7 November 2007 when she was being cross-examined by Mr Watson. There were two answers to two questions. The first appears at T 96:“Q. Did you talk to him about your family situation?A. Yeah, yes I told him when Mikel hit me and I showed him the mark on my leg”. 
     
      
    The second question appears on the next page and is as follows: 
     
      
    “Q Well you’d remember if you did because it’s fairly serious, isn’t it?A. I don’t remember exactly what I told him but okay” (witness pointing to the lower leg on the left and saying) “when Mikel hit me on my leg, he noticed the bruise and he asked me and I told him that Mikel had hit me there”. 
     
      
    3. It was not part of the prosecution case that there was, on the date of the offences charged against the two accused, any personal violence inflicted by Mr Mikel Fajloun on to KF.4. Mr Watson makes his application based upon s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995, saying that the evidence has been unfairly prejudicial to his client and is not outweighed by any probative value. 5. There is no probative value in this evidence, I say at the outset, because the answers were in a sense unresponsive and were not part of the Crown case. 6. Mr Watson argues that even though the evidence concerned an occasion or occasions other than the date of the alleged offence in this question - that being 12 November 2005 - the jury may well get the impression that the violence occurred on the same day and that hence his client was a participant in physical violence against the complainant. As Mr Watson said “the jury may well have in their mind that this kicking that is alleged against my client, took place in the circumstances of 12 November as apart to any other time”.7. His second ground was that the jury could formulate a view from the evidence that his client was the type of person that has acted violently against the complainant in the past and it would impact unfairly in making their assessment of his client in this trial. As he said, it is outside the ambit of the trial in the sense that it was never part of the Crown case. He says it is not able to be remedied by directions because a direction would simply highlight the evidence. Mr Watson says it is just that type of evidence - namely behaviour on another occasion or character evidence - which a jury keeps an eye out for and can be critical in any trial. It is not peripheral. It is central and an important aspect for the jury to consider and they could fall into a reasoning that his client was the sort of person that could have participated in such acts of violence.8. The Crown Prosecutor, Ms Herbert, opposed the discharge whilst acknowledging that the evidence was prejudicial to Mr Mikel Fajloun in a prima facie sense. She pointed to the open ended question which was asked by Mr Watson, which was not sufficiently closed as to avoid the answer and she also submitted that the problem could be dealt with by way of general directions on relationship evidence. 9. The law which is relevant to apply in these sorts of cases is conveniently summarised in Regina v Gilbert Adam (1999) 47 NSWLR 267. That in turn refers to the decision of the High Court in Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 437. 10. Adam was a decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. In a joint judgment, the Chief Justice and James and Bell JJ (as her Honour then was) referred to features which are relevant to such an application and which were referred to in Crofts. At [73] of Adam, their Honours extract a passage from Crofts which says “that in such applications, much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues, the stage at which the mishap occurs, the deliberateness of the conduct and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact”. In Adam, their Honours also referred to the judgment of the primary judge who said : “The test for a discharge of the jury is not in any doubt; there needs to be a high degree of need for such a discharge”. It was acknowledged by the learned primary judge that that need must take second place where the court takes the view that there is a tangible risk that an accused would be denied a fair trial by reason of the event which has occurred and is further satisfied that the problem cannot be appropriately cured by a direction to the jury. 11. I approach this application by Mr Watson by reference to the considerations referred to by the High Court in Crofts and adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Adam. Looking first to the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues, the first thing I observe is that the remarks were not isolated but were made as part of the general flow of evidence. So far as the issues in this trial are concerned as well, it is the submission of Mr Watson that the witness who gave this evidence, who is the complainant, is lying when she claims that it was his client who committed the crimes. That means that the jury, if it were turning its mind to this additional evidence which has fallen from her, may well approach that evidence bearing in mind in the same argument that if she is lying about the primary allegation, then she may well be lying about this as well. The same motive would be relevant. The prejudicial evidence in this case does not come from an independent source. In other words it comes from a source which has been the subject of criticism by Mr Watson and whom he has invited to the jury to reject as a witness. 12. So given that it occurred in the flow of evidence and that it was not from an independent witness, although I regard it as significant, I do not regard it as very serious in the context of the contested issues.13. Secondly, the stage at which it occurred was relatively early, I think on day two or three. But I also take into account that this trial has a history of difficulty in getting started. It has been in the list a number of times, so the desirability of a trial getting started and coming to a result, one way or the other, is a factor which I take into account.14. I do not regard, thirdly, the eliciting of the evidence as deliberate. Evidently - my understanding is from what I was told from the Bar table - the witness was told not to give any answers which may refer to those events. On the one hand though, the question was fairly open ended, although the questioner, Mr Watson himself, no doubt felt safe because he knew that she had been told not to venture into that area. But, on the other hand, there could have been a little more control in my respectful opinion, in the question that was asked. But the disclosure was not deliberate.15. Finally, I do not regard it as appropriate to give specific directions to deal with the disclosure but I have deliberately - and at the request of counsel - given directions on contextual evidence. That is evidence of other events than the events which constitute the alleged crimes in this matter. I emphasised the necessity for the jury in coming to their verdicts, to regard as relevant to the finding - whether or not the offences were proved - the importance of considering the evidence of what occurred on the day and not to draw any conclusions from other evidence about tendency. I broadened that direction deliberately a little, making reference to, for example, Mr Mikel Fajloun’s driving record to illustrate the point, so that even if the jury were to have noticed this piece of disclosed evidence, the direction I expect will take them away from using it as tendency evidence.16. For those reasons, I have concluded that it was not necessary, in the circumstances, to discharge the jury in this case and for those reasons I have rejected Mr Watson’s application.

   SENTENCEHIS HONOUR: 1. There are more than a thousand and one ways an automobile can kill, maime and destroy. Within a moment what was causing fun and laughter in a car can be turned into sorrow, tears and wreckage. Within the blink of an eye what was a life of promise, health and prospects can be changed in the collision to a life of handicap, illness and endless struggle. It is for this reason those who are permitted to drive motor vehicles must be ever vigilant, ever responsible, ever obedient to the motor traffic laws. 2. In October 2006 Catherine Addison-Jamieson was a learner driver, she was then aged eighteen. On 13 October 2006 she was charged, by police, with failing to display her L-sign and driving her grandmother’s car whilst not accompanied by a licensed driver. The following day she was involved in a collision, in circumstances where she was not displaying her L-plates and again unaccompanied by a licensed driver. Charges arising from that incident appear to have been laid on 21 October 2006. That is a third reminder to her of her prior offending conduct. 3. At 11.25pm on 24 October 2006 at Orchard Hills yet again she was driving her grandmother’s car, unaccompanied by a licensed driver. A sixteen year old girl, Robyn M, was her front seat passenger. In the rear seat was Jason B, a sixteen year old youth. Castle Road, Orchard Hills is an east/west road dissecting a semi-rural area with one lane in each direction. There is no guttering on either side of the road, the road is straight, but as the name of the suburb suggests there are hills. About 600 to 700 metres east of Kingswood Road there is a small crest followed by a larger crest, then a steep descent. There is a “CREST” sign on the approach to the larger crest. There is no street lighting but there are telegraph poles carrying electrical or power wires to the area with various smaller power poles carrying wires to the dwellings. The posted speed limit signs say 70 kph. 4. Catherine Addison-Jamieson was driving through this stretch of road. She wanted to show her passengers “How mad it was to go over the hill fast, as it’s like a roller coaster”. Approaching the crest she reached a speed of 110 kph. At the crest, grandmother’s red Holden Commodore became airbound as the road fell away. It landed in the westbound lane (the wrong side of the road for her) the driver slammed on her brakes. She sought to bring the car back into the eastbound lane. The vehicle’s skid marks cross the unbroken double white lines into and out of the eastbound lane onto the northern verge of the roadway. 5. That verge was a grass and gravel mixture. The car skidded, at least 67 metres, that is at least two-thirds the length of a football field. The rear of the vehicle collided heavily with a telegraph pole causing the pole to split into two pieces. In the last few metres of its journey it also took out three star picket fence posts and a 20 foot power pole. 6. In a moment Jason B’s future changed almost beyond belief. He sustained spinal injuries. He has limited movement in his arms and fingers, no movement or feeling from the bottom of his chest to the tip of his toes. He has a diagnosis of tetraplegia. 7. Today Catherine Addison-Jamieson is to be held accountable for her criminal behaviour. She has pleaded guilty to driving her grandmother’s car when it was involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to Jason B and at the time of the impact she was driving that vehicle at a speed dangerous to other persons. The Court's Task8. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions, as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence, before this Court, committed by this offender, harming this victim, in this community, Gladue v Regina [1999] 1 SCR 688 [80]. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to her, that is subjective matters. The starting point for such assessment requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender. 9. My fact finding task has been circumscribed in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts. It is sufficient, at this point, that I remind the Court a judge is not party to the agreed set of facts. The tender of agreed facts does not relieve him or her from the fact finding responsibility it simply limits the material from which facts may be found. To the extent, if it be the case, that the facts as agreed do not reflect the actual events that occurred, it must be remembered the Court can only find facts from the evidence placed before it.10. This offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, as best I can, even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, available discounts, if any, whether special circumstances are to be found, back up charges brought from the Local Court to be finalised in this Court and finally of course the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment or other penalty that is to be imposed. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. 11. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have, as its primary focus, the protection of the community, will also need to be determined, see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740. FURTHER FACTS12. The crash investigation unit officer having observed the scene reported,  
     
      
      5. At the time of my arrival it was dark, there was no street lighting in the vicinity of the collision. The weather was fine and dry. The roadway was dry. The road surface in the vicinity of the collision was bitumen construction. The road surface appeared to be in good condition... 
       
       
      8. I noticed there was major damage to a Holden Commodore... the damage was concentrated to the rear of the vehicle... 
       
       
      12. The second skid mark started in the eastbound lane, it crossed over the first skid mark and finished near telephone pole number ... the total length of the skid mark was approximately 29.7 metres. 
       
       
      13. The third skid mark started in the westbound lane. The skid mark crossed the unbroken double white lines onto the eastbound lane. In the eastbound lane the skid mark had striations near the northern side of the roadway. These striation marks continued onto the northern side of the roadway. These striation marks continued onto the northern side of the roadway into furrows. These furrows finished where the star picket fence was damaged. The total length of the skid mark was approximately 56.8 metres.” 
       
      
    Striation marks indicate that although the car is travelling forward the rear of the car is jutting outwards so that the car is travelling forward, but at an angle with all four wheels making their own path forward. 13. Ms Addison-Jamieson gave evidence that at the time of the impact she had been driving for two years, but did not describe herself as an experienced driver. Her evidence was that because of her family circumstances it was difficult for her to have a fully licensed driver with her. Her father is presently in prison, although at the time he was living with them and had lived with them for two years. He did not have a licence. Her Grandmother, with whom she lives, is sick, while her mother suffers multiple sclerosis, to a point of it being a significant disability for her. Only the grandmother is a licensed driver. 14 .That evidence however, needs to be contrasted with the evidence of the offender’s mother, who thought her daughter had her “P” plates. The mother was unaware her daughter had been breached for driving without a driver’s licence. The offender’s evidence is that she had told her grandmother, the owner of the car, she had her P’s. When she drove the car she claimed she would display the P’s. However, on 24 October 2007 the offender conceded there were no P plates displayed. I am satisfied the offender deceived her grandmother as to her licence status and lawful entitlement to drive the motor vehicle. The offender told Probation and Parole she also deceived her mother on that score as well. 15. The offender’s account of the circumstances in which the impact was occasioned is to be found on page 7 of the transcript.  
     
      
      We were approaching the hill and I was accelerating up the hill and then as we approached the top of the hill I realised I was doing between 100 and 110 and I went to apply the brakes, because I knew that was too fast and by that time the car had gone over the hill and was airborne. The brakes weren’t touching because the tyres weren’t on the ground.” 
       
      
    On the same page she reviews the injured state of Jason B  
     
      
      …- apparently we were knocked out so when I woke up I got out of the car, I left everything how it was. I saw Robyn go over to the side of the road and she was sitting on the road and then I realised Jason wasn’t out of the car. I went back to the car, I realised there were power lines around the car and I was worried that the car was going to catch on fire. I saw Jason had his seatbelt on and he was trapped and I didn’t want to undo it and move him because of spinal injury. I just wanted to keep him awake. So I yelled at him to wake him up, because he was unconscious. 
       
       
      Then when he woke up I kept asking him questions to keep him awake until the ambulance arrived.” 
       
      
    16. The offender told Fabiola Bedon, a consultant psychologist retained by the defence that the spinal injury occasioned to Jason B, had occurred because a spare tyre apparently loose in the boot of the motor vehicle had come through the back seat into the cabin, striking Jason B in his spinal area. That the tyre could break through those barriers, indicates the speed that the vehicle was going. 17. A more detailed review of Jason B’s injuries comes from the medical reports. Dr Magdalena Mironowicz in an expert certificate dated 19 January 2007 records that:  
     
      
      “Jason was noted to have distal arm weakness, loss of movement in the legs and was combative and confused. He had bruising and swelling around the right eye and bilateral knee abrasions. X-ray and CT scans revealed no obvious intracranial injury. There was an unstable fracture of the cervical spine centred around C5 and C6. A haematoma and herniated disc posterior to the body of the C5 compressing the spinal cord was identified. Fractures of the transverse foraminae of C5 and C6 bilaterally raised the possibility of a vertebral artery injury. An anterior subluxation on C5 and C6 of five millimetres was also seen. Numerous pulmonary contusions” [that is bruises to the lung] “were seen on the CT scan. There was a comminuted fracture of the blade of the left scapula. Abdominal CT revealed thickening of the jejunal loops which may signify a small bowel injury without any perforation. An intra-articular fracture involving the right acetabular roof extended superiorly into the right iliac bone was identified.” 
       
      
    18. This case was beyond the resources of the Penrith Hospital where Jason B had been transferred. He was transferred to the Prince of Wales. Dr Harry Peters from that hospital reports that at the scene of the accident he was found unconscious with his head flexed and wedged between the seats and the floor. 19. His Glasgow Coma score on arrival at Nepean Hospital was 8, which improved to 13. He was noted to be in spinal shock with bradycardia and priapism. He was noted to be tetraplegic with no movement in arms or legs. Other injuries sustained in the accident were cervical spine, 5,6 fracture of the vertebral body. Fracture of the right pedicle of C6 with fragment into the canal. 75 percent of the canal at C6 was obliterated. Chest:- Lower left lobal contusion, comminuted fracture of the left scapula. Pelvis:- Stable right pelvic fracture which extended into the right hip joint. 20. There is an inconsistency between what Dr Peters reports and the offender's account of talking, that is of the victim having a Glasgow coma score of 8 on arrival at the hospital and being unconscious when police arrived and the offender talking to him, to keep him awake.21. Jason was treated in intensive care from 25 October to 7 November, when he was transferred to the Acute Spinal Unit at Prince of Wales. There he remained until 23 November. His next treatment centre was the Spinal Rehabilitation Unit, also at Prince of Wales where he remained until 9 May 2007. He was discharged from the Prince of Wales on that date, nearly seven months after impact. There is a second report from Dr Peters dated 1 November 2007. It reports that since the accident Jason has been treated in the neurological unit and in the rehabilitation units. 
     
      
      “Of concern now is his present state of health and what he can and cannot do since his injury. 
       
       
      1. [Jason] has been and continues to be wheelchair bound. 
       
       
      2. He has a carer who looks after his toilet needs and all his personal care. 
       
       
      3. He is having daily dressings of spinal pressure areas. 
       
       
      4. He has seen an orthotoist. 
       
       
      5. He depends on a private nursing agency. 
       
       
      6. He has a regime of daily Microlax enemas to regulate his bowel motions. 
       
       
      7. He is fully dependent for all activities of daily living.” 
       
      
    That is a sad litany of the impact and legacy of this motor ride for Jason B.22. The other passenger, Robyn M, was also conveyed to Nepean Hospital. She sustained soft tissue injury. The offender was conveyed to Mount Druitt Hospital. She too sustained soft tissue injury. 23. On 27 October 2006, three days after the impact, the offender participated in an interview with police. She told them that at the time of driving she was tired. Her female passenger told police that in a conversation immediately prior to the impact the offender said she was tired. I am satisfied the offender said words to that effect and that there was some tiredness. But the tiredness did not impact upon her decision to accelerate the car over the crests. Nor did the tiredness impact upon the offender’s decision making judgment or execution of such driving skills as she had on this night. Objective Criminality 24. From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of this offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant offence with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is, in this way, that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact on the overall sentencing.25. The roads of the State are, for the most part, owned by one of three levels of government. That is the Federal Government, the State Government or the Municipal Government. There is no inherent right to drive upon the roads, they are not the private property of any individual, they are the property of the State. Only those accorded the privilege of a licence are entitled to drive upon the roads. Licenses are only issued to those who, by submitting themselves to tests of their driving skills and their knowledge of the road rules, agree to be bound by the rules of the road so that the safety of others who use the road, is assured. The purpose of those tests of driving skills and knowledge is to ensure, for other road users, that drivers at least reach a minimum standard of capacity to manage and control a car before they are permitted to drive on the road alone.26. In addition to the road rules, the criminal law has been harnessed to punish those who, as a consequence of dangerous driving cause a vehicle collision as a result of which really serious injury is caused to another person. The criminality of this offence has to be evaluated against that background. Many offenders have difficulty understanding that an offence such as this one, is a criminal offence, as distinct from a driving offence, because they did not intend harm to their victim. From the victim’s point of view, of course, he, in this case, did nothing towards the offender that caused this injury to him. It is true that the criminal law does have a role to play where offender’s with malice do violence to others. But it is also true that the criminal law has a role to play where driver’s, through their unlawful conduct, moral culpability and abandonment of responsibility do violence to others and that is this case.27. The unlawful conduct of this offender, and her driving in a speed dangerous to the public was unlawful, resulted in serious violence to the body of her friend and the resulting devastating and permanent injury to Jason B.28. This court has the benefit of a Court of Criminal Appeal guideline judgment, R v White [2006] NSWCCA 340. The Court of Criminal Appeal is a court having authority over this Court. R v White requires this Court to assess the degree of moral culpability involved when determining the appropriateness of a full time custodial sentence. A key to determining the level of moral culpability is to ask  
     
      
      Whether the combination of circumstances are such that it can be said the offender ... abandoned responsibility for her conduct in the driving that lead to the impact?  
       
      
    29. The Chief Justice, the author of the guideline judgment, postulated that one lone individual aggravating factor was on its own capable of indicating a high degree of moral culpability. Although he said, such a conclusion is more likely where aggravating factors exist in combination. 30. Whyte, the guideline judgment, at p228, presented a useful check list. Of relevance to this case are the following items from that checklist: 
     
      
      “1. Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted. 
       
       
       2. Number of people put at risk. 
       
       
       3. Degree of speed. 
       
       
       5. Erratic or aggressive driving. 
       
       
       6. Competitive driving or showing off. 
       
       
       7. Length of journey during which other were exposed to risk. 
       
       
       8. Ignoring of warnings. 
       
       
      10. Degree of sleep deprivation.” 
       
      
    31. There appears to me to be an important further aggravating factor that may not have been of relevance in R v Whyte but is of relevance here. Namely, driving in circumstances where it was unlawful so to do. 32. I now turn to each of the itemised aggravating features that I have selected coming from the check list.  
     
      
      1. 
      Extent and nature of injury inflicted.  
      I have reviewed in detail the nature of the injuries inflicted. Those injuries are at the extreme end of seriousness. While it may be possible to imagine more serious injuries than these, these reached that level. Even if the injuries are not intended, injuries of this calibre are a measure of criminality, see  
      R v Buttsworth  
      and s 21A(2(g) of the  
      Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      .  
      
    33. The fact that the offender did not intend the injuries, puts this case outside the criminality associated with malice. But clearly a case where injury is serious represents greater criminality than the same offending act injury is trivial because the more severe consequence of the offending act where injury is the greater.34. 2.Number of persons put at risk. In this case the only persons put at actual risk were the offender and her two passengers. 35. 3.The degree of speed. Speed is an essential element of this offence, as such it’s capacity to be an aggravating feature, needs to be delineated. To constitute an element of the offence the speed of the vehicle must reach a point where it becomes the feature of driving, that is dangerous to the public. To the extent that the speed exceeds that point and the danger to the public becomes more acute then that additional speed must be seen as the aggravating feature. 36. I have sought to take into account speed as an element of the offence when exploring the Chief Justice’s list of aggravating features as established by authority. The degree of speed at which the car was driven exhibits a gross abandonment of responsibility. The agreed facts express the speed reached 110 kilometres. The speed limit there was 70 kilometres. This speed is 40 kilometres above the marked speed limit. 37. The speed has to be measured through a number of other prisms to illustrate the abandonment of responsibility. As a learner driver the offender was not permitted to drive above a speed of 80 kph. The signed speed limit, as I said, was 70 kph. Her driving skill base was inadequate to manage the vehicle at the speed she was travelling on a flat surface yet she was cresting two hills, at night, in a street with no lighting. She was driving above her set speed limits with no experienced licensed driver to assist her should she get into trouble. She had no good reason to be driving at this speed. 38. In driving at the speed that she was, she was endangering at least three persons in her vehicle. She was driving at a speed which, if her account is correct and there was a loose tyre in the car and the car was stopped suddenly, that tyre could be a lethal weapon. 39. In the guideline judgment aggravating feature 5 is expressed as “erratic or aggressive driving”. The offender’s driving as she attacked the hill was aggressive, she “gunned” (my word) the accelerator to reach 110 kph. Implicit in this head of aggravation is the proposition that particular features of the manner of driving may aggravate the criminality. In this case a number of features about the driving, in addition to its aggressiveness aggravate or constitute the aggressiveness of the driving. 40. Firstly, the offender’s driving through the whole of that day culminating in the incident at Castle Road was unlawful. The moment she sat behind the wheel, without a licensed driver by her side, whatever else she did, her conduct was unlawful. She abandoned responsibility to her fellow citizens and the State. It is inconceivable to imagine that a licensed driver would have permitted her to drive at the speed she did along the particular section of road she was travelling. It was the offender’s decision to toss that safeguard out the window. That was a contributing factor to this incident.41. The loss of control occurred because at the speed she drove over the crest, the car became airborne. The offender’s level of driving skills was inadequate, demonstrably so. She did not intend that the car would become airborne. That was the first error of judgment. Her response was to apply the brakes as she was landing. That was her second error of judgment. Stopping the wheels when the car was landing caused it to skid. A skidding car is more difficult to control. Her loss of control through the car being airborne saw it land, or at least end up, on the wrong side of the road. She then oversteered the car, again an error of judgment, across to the correct side of the road and then off that side into the verge of grass and gravel. As the car was in the eastbound lane the rear of the car came out of alignment. This eighteen year old girl had no idea how to, nor the skill level required to manage the vehicle. Nor did she have the driving experience sufficient to foresee that the speed that she was driving at, as she crested the hill could go so horribly wrong.42. She lacked the foresight, lacked the driving skill, at that speed. Her willingness to drive when it was unlawful for her so to do are circumstances all pointing to an abandonment of responsibility to deliberately determine to drive this stretch of road at 110 kph.43 6  Competitive driving and showing off It is to be remembered the offender told the passengers she wanted to show them “how mad it was to go over the hill fast"", as it’s ""like a rollercoaster.” While that may be an aspect of showing off, what she was doing was to use the vehicle for thrill seeking gratification. It was the desire to increase the thrill that lead her to increasing the speed to a level of dangerousness to other people, particularly her passengers.44. Thrill seeking is far from an appropriate purpose to drive a car at speed dangerous to others on public roads. Racing car and rally car drivers, who are prepared to drive their vehicles at dangerous speeds do so in highly regulated circumstances. They have the skills, indeed I understand they require a special licence. They have specially modified or designed cars. They wear protective clothing and there are strictly enforced rules, practices and procedures to be observed through the driving, whether on the dedicated racing tracks or the prescribed and patrolled rally routes. Usually they have reviewed the route or circuit that they are travelling on, so that they know it fairly well. To state all this is to demonstrate the abandonment of responsibility exhibited by this offender when she deliberately chose to drive her vehicle at a speed dangerous to others. 45. The measure is the rally car driver wouldn’t have done it in that vehicle in the circumstances in which the three youths found themselves. 46. 7. Length of journey during which others were exposed to risk There is no doubt that the risk was at its highest at the point at which this impact occurred. But my view is that driving with this unlicensed driver, without an authorised licensed driver by her side was exposing her passengers’ to risk throughout the whole time they were in the vehicle. 47. 8. Ignoring warnings. On 13 October and again on 14 October she had been caught by police driving without a licence. On 14 October she had been involved in a motor vehicle accident and charged with negligent driving. Those charges are dated 21 October, although I don’t know whether she received them at that time, it is likely she received them before the 24th. They may have been Court Attendance Notices posted to her. Past behaviour is frequently a learning tool. We are supposed to learn from our past mistakes. They are warnings to us. This offender ignored those warnings. Her driving, knowing she was not legally entitled so to do constitutes a deliberate flouting of the law. The deliberate flouting of the law in circumstances such as this adds to the dimension of moral culpability. 48. Having regard to the offender’s impoverished skill level, absence of licensed driver, her decision deliberately to break the posted speed limit by 40 kilometres in circumstances where her vision beyond the crest of the hills was obscured, this offence was committed without regard to public safety. On the other hand, although she had been charged with driving offences that had not yet been resolved by the courts I do not regard her as having made any undertaking to the court in respect of her future conduct. She was not on bail or any form of conditional liberty at the time this offence was committed.49. 10. Degree of sleep deprivation The offender told police and her companion she was tired. There is no evidence persuading me, beyond reasonable doubt that her sense of tiredness was sufficient to have played any part in her offending conduct. I have not aggravated her criminality on that account. Factors contributing to the offender’s moral culpability are the factors relating specifically to her driving. The first two factors I dealt with, the extent of the injury and the number of persons put at risk will impact adversely in the assessment of her criminality. But her moral culpability and abandonment of responsibility fall to be assessed on the other factors I have dealt with.50. There is a wide spectrum of behaviour indicative of differing levels of moral culpability. That is differing levels of abandonment of responsibility. This offender’s behaviour must be placed somewhere on the continuum between what is called “momentary inattention” and complete “abandonment of responsibility”. A review of the factors I have just made puts this offending conduct above a mid point on the continuum. There is no suggestion of any presence of alcohol or drugs in the driver’s blood system nor of competitive driving. While the speed she was driving at was gross, namely 110 kph, it could have been worse. Her conduct post impact would appear to be all that could be asked of her. She was not fleeing the police at the time of the collision. Finding the precise words to quantify her level of abandonment of responsibility is difficult. I put it above a mid point. I choose to describe it as serious. The cases put the upper limit as “abandonment of responsibility” or “high moral culpability”. 51. Objectively this case does not fall in a worse category. There are, however, features making it or bringing it into a serious category. The seriousness of the injury as I have said also impacts adversely upon the assessment of the objective criminality. The number of people put at risk is limited to three. That factor does not impact as adversely as it would if the number had been greater than three. 52. The Chief Justice in an earlier guideline case Jurissic [1998] 45 NSWLR 209, identified a typical dangerous driving case as having the following characteristics.  
     
      
      1.Young Offender. 
       
       
      2.Of good character with no or limited prior convictions. 
       
       
      3.Death or permanent injury to a single person. 
       
       
      4.The victim is a stranger. 
       
       
      5.No or limited injury to the driver or the driver’s intimates. 
       
       
      6.Genuine remorse. 
       
       
      7.Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value. 
       
      
    53. In this case the victim was within the car; known to the offender, not a stranger to her. What is not explored in the evidence is the extent of his knowledge regarding the offender’s driving experience and qualifications. In the absence of proof I have neither assumed nor attributed any knowledge to him. There is nothing to suggest he lent any encouragement to her driving or in anyway contributed to the impact. In those circumstances I see little difference in the criminality associated with injuring a stranger as compared to injuring this innocent associate. This case falls to be considered as a typical case. 54, The guidelines promulgated focused attention upon the objective circumstances of the typical case. The guideline promulgated in Whyte was in these terms.  
     
      
      Where an offender’s moral culpability is high a full time custodial sentence of two years, in the case of injury, amounting to grievous bodily harm would not be appropriate.  
       
      
    55. Put another way, the guideline calls for a full time custodial sentence in excess of two years where the moral culpability is high.56, As I said this guideline is based upon objective circumstances only. Subjective circumstances to which I will come after the morning tea adjournment impact also upon the sentence.SHORT ADJOURNMENTHIS HONOUR: 57. Victim Impact Statement. I have received a Victim Impact Statement. The material contained in the victim impact statement is not sworn evidence and has not been the subject of cross-examination. To the extent that opinions are expressed in the statement, in this case they are opinions of a social worker..(not transcribable).. 58. The function of statements such as this one is firstly to give to the victims the opportunity of being heard in sentencing proceedings, by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited upon them by the actions of the offender. Secondly, to enable the sentencing procedures to assist victims as they move towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arriving from the criminal conduct of an offender. Thirdly, the victim impact statement contributes to an offender at least hearing first hand and perhaps gaining an insight into the impact her offending conduct had upon the victim. Finally, the victim impact statement ensures that the Court has a continuing consciousness of the impact violent crimes have upon those ordinary men and women who are its victims. As such victim impact statements play a very important part in the administration of criminal justice.59. The author of this victim impact statement is Elizabeth Davies, a social worker having twenty-five years of clinical experience. She says that Jason is tetraplegic, confined to a wheelchair as a result of the incident. He reported he has no sensation or voluntary movement below his mid chest. He has no movement in his fingers and limited movement in his arms. He reported his whole body spasms and feels at times as though it will snap. As a result of these spasms he has developed a pressure sore on his knee where it has involuntarily rubbed against the other. Jason spent eight months in Prince of Wales Hospital, mostly in the spinal injuries unit. He returns to hospital on a weekly basis for ongoing rehabilitation, monitoring of his condition and treatment of the pressure sore that has developed. 60. Jason is dependent on others for all his personal care. This includes feeding, bathing and toileting. Limited arm movement allows him to feed himself a little but he says he makes a mess. He spoke of previously enjoying his independence stating “now it’s all gone”. He stated he enjoyed spending time with friends and a range of sports including soccer, football and riding his bike.  
     
      
      He expressed the wish to be alone at times and to go out in his wheelchair. His mother fears for his personal safety because of his physical vulnerability and doesn’t want him out alone. These times he reported thinking “Mum let me go,” and “Leave me alone.”  
       
      
    61. He describes himself feeling bored, stating he spends his time playing X-Box and using a mouth activated laptop computer to play computer games. When asked about his future, Jason stated, “I don’t think I’ll be around for the future.” He spoke of being interested in girls but looked towards his wheelchair and stated “I tried to get over it.” He spoke of conversations that occurred with other young men in the spinal injuries unit, indirectly acknowledging that a sexual relationship is not something he can assume is possible.62. There is hearsay evidence that he experienced mood swings and can be “angry and nasty and then kind.” His mother stated that Jason “Yells at her” to which he added, ""I yell at everyone"". He expressed a long standing dislike of routine, acknowledging that routine is now crucial for the nurses and family members who perform his personal care. 63. He said that if it was up to “Me, I wouldn’t have them.” meaning his carers. Jason spoke about the memories of the incident being very fresh in his mind. He spoke about trying not to think about the incident and trying to get it out of his head.64. He states that he avoids talking about it and is aware of people looking at him and looking away and also aware of the “what happened” questions he was asked by people he meets. Jason reports that he experiences what he calls flashbacks. He spoke of these occurring while he is sleeping, several nights a week and up to five times each night of these times he spoke of the flashbacks “kicking in” and “seeing and hearing everything like a movie.” 65. Jason spoke of repeatedly having a dream in which he tries not to go in the car with the offender, but despite his efforts always ends up in the car “reliving” what happened “seeing the hill and the pole.” He describes his sleep as unsettled as a result of these flashbacks and the involuntary spasms of his body. 66. Jason spoke of a variety of triggers for memories of the incident. He stated that “going down hills” “even in his friends’ car is frightening, telling them to go slowly and to stop for a second so that he can get used to the hill. Jason reported he doesn’t like to talk or think about the incident and the injuries he sustained. He admits he tries to make a joke and laugh off the difficulties he continues to experience. As an example, he recalled an episode of incontinence at a local shopping centre which was obviously embarrassing, but about which he laughed as he retold it.67. He spoke with apparent bravado at times appearing to minimise his emotional responses. The impact of what has been happening stating “I don’t care about it” whilst admitting that he had cried. He reported avoiding talking to psychologists or social workers while in hospital and that he has spoken very little to family members about his thoughts and feelings. This may help to explain the continuing presence of his trauma symptoms, his recurrent thoughts and memories, flash backs and dreams.68. That’s as much of the victim impact statement as I am going to publish. SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES69. I turn now to the subjective factors. I am both entitled and required to do that. As I said earlier, not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence, but I am also sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender, nor some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate.Personal care, family background, relationships.70. Catherine Addison-Jamieson was born in April 1988. In October 2006 she was eighteen and a half years old. She is now nineteen and a half, she is single. She says there was a two year relationship she had with a boy aged nineteen when she was aged, seventeen. That relationship ended when he formed another relationship. She resides with her mother and grandmother, both of whom have chronic debilitative medical conditions. The offender is in receipt of a carer’s pension. Catherine Addison-Jamieson was born to a sixteen year old mother. The mother is still supportive of her daughter, but at nineteen the daughter is the mother’s carer. At thirty-eight the mother suffers from multi-sclerosis. She receives a disability pension. The grandmother has been in a string of eight car accidents in five years. She also has the legacy of work related injuries. These have caused injuries to her back, neck, crushed vertebra and slipped discs. She has had cancer of the cervix, deep vein thrombosis, in her left leg. She suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure. The disabilities of the senior adults is a topic to which I must return.71. Ms Addison-Jamieson’s father is a recidivist criminal. He has been in and out of gaol. She first met her father when aged twelve. Currently he is said to be in Cessnock Prison serving a sentence of some unspecified length. It is said he has experienced alcohol and drug abuse problems. It is said by the offender he has become more and more aggressive towards her. The offender also claims he has become very aggressive towards her mother. 72, Her evidence was that she had previously obtained an AVO against him. She claimed he had nowhere to stay and her mother let him return to the house. She could not handle being around - for her the things he was doing amounted to torture. 73. An apprehended violence order was obtained on 19 September last year. The terms of the order, as I read them, would permit the father to remain at the premises provided he did not engage in conduct amounting to intimidation, assault, molesting and the like. 74. The mother’s evidence was that the daughter was continually seeking to please her father to no avail. Her evidence was he had lost his temper with her (the mother) once or twice. The lifestyle pursued by Catherine Addison-Jamieson was focused particularly on her mother and grandmother and matters to do with the home. Consequently her network of peers is confined. A family friend told Probation and Parole there was a lack of friends her own age. Catherine Addison-Jamieson claims a full daily routine caring for the adult family members, that gives her time to walk the dogs, but she does not have many friends any more.Education, employment and incapacitated relatives.75. Ms Catherine Addison-Jamieson’s account is she left school halfway through Year 11 to care for her mother and grandmother. Her schooling was unstable. She had been to nine schools, some private, some public. Her account to Ms Bedon was that she changed schools because she was targeted by bullies, at the various schools, particularly teasing her about her weight and size. She continued her education via Sydney Distant Education High School where she met requirements for the School Certificate. She discontinued her education following committing the present offences. She told Probation and Parole she intends to resume studying high school. She told the Court she was enrolled to do a home TAFE course next year at OTEN, when she will do Year 12 Certificate and Child Care and Welfare. 76. At nineteen she has not yet been in paid employment. Since she left school she has been in receipt of a carer’s pension. As early as age nine or ten she said she was making breakfast and bringing tablets and things to her mother and grandmother. Her mother was diagnosed with MS in 2003. I am satisfied she was having health difficulties for sometime before 2003 and before a correct diagnosis was made. 77. In evidence Catherine Addison-Jamieson gave a detailed account of her daily routine, page 9. 
     
      
      “I will wake up in the morning, I will come out, I will prepare breakfast and get their morning tablets ready then I will put my Nan into the shower and then get their clothes ready. Then when she’s come out I will do the same with my mother. Then I make sure they’re settled for the morning and then I will do some house cleaning. Maybe some washing up or put a load of clothing on. Then I would prepare lunch; then their lunch time tablets and then my Mum has afternoon tablets in between dinner and lunch and then I might take Mum for a walk in her wheelchair with the dogs down to the park or something to get out of the house. Then of an afternoon I would prepare dinner, get their night time tablets ready and either shower them or get them ready for bed. 
       
       
      Q. What does your mother do for a herself on a daily basis?  
       
       
      A. She can dress herself as long as I bring her the clothes and things. She can take herself to the bathroom. If I help her into the bathroom she can do bathroom things herself. She’s all right with communicating with people as long as she’s not having a bad day, then she tends to slur, so I have to do her appointments and things like that as well.” 
       
      
    78. The difficulty with that account is that on the day of the impact she had been out with her friends and was intending to sleep out with them. It is difficult to reconcile her claim of total commitment to her mother and grandmother together with their claim to total dependence upon her and her conduct for the day and night of 24 October. I have not ruled out the possibility that she was also away from home for a substantial period on 14 October as well. 79. There is no medical evidence delineating the extent of the grandmother’s incapacity nor any expert evidence going to the depth of the grandmother’s dependence upon her granddaughter. The evidence fails to establish whether the offender is regarded by the relevant government department as the carer for both her mother and her grandmother, in saying that I accept that Ms Catherine Addison-Jamieson effectively gives that evidence orally. However, examples I have given of what appear to me to be conflicting positions convinces me the offender is inconsistent in the evidence she gives. 80. I accept both mother and grandmother receive disability pensions. I accept the offender receives a carer’s pension. I have heard from Ms Leanne Addison-Jamieson. There is a two line medical report describing Ms Leanne Addison-Jamieson as suffering multiple sclerosis which has given her “intermittent neurological symptoms over recent years”. It is difficult to build a case of total dependency upon such a report. Ms Leanne Addison-Jamieson’s mobility is compromised. The level of compromise apparently varies. On the day of the hearing she presented in a wheelchair. Acceptance of a need for a wheelchair is a decision usually taken with great reluctance by MS sufferers because of the associated private stigma attached to the inevitability of public recognition that such an advanced state of the MS has been reached that equipment associated with severe handicapped is now an essential requirement.81. Ms Leanne Addison-Jamieson tried to approach the witness box for the purpose of giving evidence from her wheelchair. While I do not doubt her courage in making the attempt her progress was so precarious and difficult for her that I intervened. She gave evidence seated in her wheelchair in the well of the Court. 82. The evidence establishes there are no other relatives available to take full time care of these two women. While I remain unsatisfied that the quality of care offered by her daughter is as committed or complete as the daughter would have me believe I am also satisfied Ms Leanne Addison-Jamieson is in need of such care. Further I am satisfied, but for, some casual intervention from Hillsong Church and perhaps other charities those functions that the daughter should be performing will not be performed in her absence by any other person. 83. I note that she does appear to have support of a Stephen Rowe, an engineer, although the extent of that support is unclear in the evidence. I have been troubled whether it is better to have a mediocre self-focused carer or no carer at all. 84. As to the grandmother’s need for the carer the evidence is unsatisfactory. She is the only licensed driver in the family. That suggests a level of competence and mobility. On the other hand the offender and her mother say she is in need of care. Not all persons on a disability pension are in need of a carer. If I was required to consider the grandmother’s case alone, whether it would be inhumane to ignore her needs in the sentencing, on the evidence currently before me I am of the view the defence would have failed to persuade me. The onus is on them. The quality of evidence required would need to demonstrate with some precision the nature of the illnesses and the reason why a full time carer is required. There should be expert evidence from medical diagnosticians and reasonably, an occupational therapist supporting a case for extraordinary circumstances.85. I note the grandmother was at the court hearing and indeed is here today. She appears to have reasonable mobility as she came and went from court. I am prepared to accept she would benefit from having a support person living with her. I accept her own daughter, Ms Leanne Addison-Jamieson’s health is too poor to offer such physical supports as the grandmother may need. I am satisfied the offender’s father is, at best, unsympathetic to the needs of Ms Leanne Addison-Jamieson and her mother. He is abusive and perhaps worse. I am satisfied the offender’s time in custody will be more arduous for her knowing her mother is without the support she needs and the grandmother likewise. But as I say the grandmother’s needs have not been clearly delineated.86. Short of institutional care, assuming institutional care was ever a possibility, Ms Leanne Addison-Jamieson will be without support. She says her condition has stabilised. Whether stabilisation will continue is speculative. Even as she is, it would be inhumane not to consider her needs when I come to sentence her daughter.General Health.87. There is nothing before me to suggest the offender has any major health problems. She is sensitive about her weight, she presents as a nineteen year old who may be having personal issues with her weight, but her weight is by no means at any extreme end. Mental Health88. Ms Bedon assessed the offender for the defence. She is assessed as being in the low average range of cognitive ability. Her personality profile indicates marked anxiety and episodes of obstructive anger. It was Ms Bedon’s opinion that the offender is usually able to function on a satisfactory basis, but may experience periods of marked emotional, cognitive and behavioural dysfunction. She experiences prolonged periods of depressive and anxious moods with panic attacks. She has very low self-esteem. Also of significance was dependent and impulsive traits. 89. Catherine Addison-Jamieson is a candidate for numerous psychological issues. Aged four she was sexually molested, there was a reference to her being molested to the extent of penile vaginal intercourse and it was said over a year. Apart from the oral history there is nothing before the court to crystallise the picture other than sexually molested. Although the offender moved from the neighbourhood she still, it is said, seeks counselling, psychological counselling from time to time in respect of this matter. 90. .Her father is an abuser, unstable and a negative influence. Her peer group contacts are minimal and it would appear no good support can be expected from them. Although she is the daughter she has become the carer of both her mother and grandmother, a significant role reversal. To whatever other psychological issues she has, she is now trying to cope with her part in the disenabling and permanently incapacitating another human being about which she feels much guilt. I am satisfied there is a real need for psychological counselling for her of some intensity.Alcohol, drugs, gambling, addictive behaviour.91. There is nothing in the evidence before me to suggest any of these matters are any problem in the offender’s lifestyle. Character and criminal history92. As to her character, while I regard her as overstating her past caring duties I am satisfied for some years now she has involved herself in the care of her mother and to a lesser extent in the care of her grandmother. For a teenage girl this role was no doubt demanding. Fulfilling it, even if imperfectly, deprived her of many opportunities of being a young girl and mixing with other young girls. She has been required to assume responsibilities beyond her age. She acknowledges that she should be fulfilling the responsibilities, although as I say, to me it seems somewhat imperfectly.93. I have already drawn attention to the driving charges presented against the offender. I took account of those charges adversely on the issue of the warning they presented to her. I do not otherwise regard the offender’s criminal history as an adverse matter. The only matters on her antecedents are traffic matters earlier referred to. Putting to one side the specific issue I dealt with in respect of her antecedents, her antecedents and her character do not disentitle her to consideration of some mitigation of penalty.Attitude to the Offence94. There can be no doubt this offender is profoundly remorseful. She has sought counselling because of flash backs she has had to the impact scene. Her evidence was  
     
      
      “The fact that Jason was such a nice and caring boy and that I’ve done this to him and I put this pain into his family’s life every day that ... is not ..(not transcribable).. and I constantly have flash backs to seeing him in the back seat and the actual accident happening. I just - I wish I could speak to his family and explain how sorry I am. I know that wouldn’t do anything for them ...” 
       
       
      “I would just like to tell him that I am so sorry that changing his life forever he didn’t deserve this, he was a good person and I’m so sorry for what I’ve done and I didn’t do it on purpose. I didn’t intentionally want to hurt him.” 
      
    Plea Status95. The offender pleaded guilty before Magistrate Bartley at the Penrith Local Court on 24 August 2007. She adhered to that plea before this Court. I regard that plea as early entered. I intend to give a discount of 25% based upon the early plea as demonstrating acceptance of full responsibility for her offending conduct and her profound contrition.Rehabilitation prospects96. There are a number of features pointing to positive rehabilitation prospects. 
     
     Strong support from mother and grandmother. 
      
      
     Plea of guilty and insight into offending conduct. 
      
      
     Remorse. 
      
      
     Limited criminal/traffic record. 
      
      
     Plans to advance her education. 
      
    97. On the other hand there are also negative indicators. 
     
     Serious emotional and psychological issues yet to be resolved. 
      
      
     Counter productive influence of her father. 
      
      
     Failure in the past to heed warning signs. 
      
    98. Overall however I regard her rehabilitation prospects as more positive than negative.SETTING THE SENTENCEDeterrence.99. Notwithstanding the youth of the offender this is an offence in which deterrence is called for. That is because driving a motor vehicle on public roads is an adult task. In our society, obtaining a driver’s licence for young persons is part of their right of passage from youth to adulthood. It is an acknowledgement by them that they are prepared to take on the adult responsibilities that come with driving a motor vehicle. Therefore their criminal offending, when they drive their vehicles must be seen as adult criminal offending and considerations usually applicable to youth, in my view, do not apply when they sit behind the wheel of a vehicle and drive it lethally. 100. One expects however, that the vehicle impact itself, the horrific injuries occasioned to Jason B, the subsequent charging and court proceedings, the denunciation of her irresponsible criminal conduct by a judicial officer and the subsequent incarceration to follow will constitute all the personal deterrence that is required in this case. The maximum penalty for this offence is seven years imprisonment. Applying the plea discount101. But for the plea of guilty I would have imposed and overall sentence, for this offence, of four and a half years. That figure is reached by taking the objective criminality into account, that I have referred to, and the subjective features that I have referred to. That sentence of four and a half years is to be discounted by 25%, making a discount of thirteen months and fifteen days. Giving an overall sentence of three years, four months and fifteen days.Finding Special Circumstances102. In the normal course of events the non-parole period should be about three quarters of the sentence. If special circumstances are found the non-parole period can be a little less than three quarters of the sentence. I intend to find special circumstances. My reasons for so doing are these.  
     
     This is the offender’s first time in custody. 
      
      
     Her youth. 
      
      
     “It is never easy to sentence a young [woman] to a custodial sentence. s 5 provides the court should not do so unless it is the only appropriate penalty. However, there are cases and this is one of them, where not to do so would be to fall into appealable error. The youth of [this offender] is particularly relevant to the determination of the relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. Despite the significance of deterrence and the need to protect the public, youth is still relevant to the assessment of overall criminality. [source of quote to be determined]. 
      
      
     Bearing in mind s 21A(3)(j) of the Act  
      
      
     The observation of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
     R v Hearne 
      (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 at 461”  
      
    103. Catherine Louise Addison-Jamieson I convict you of driving a vehicle, namely your mother’s Holden Commodore, when it was involved in an impact occasioning grievous bodily harm to Jason B and at the time of the impact you were driving the vehicle at a speed dangerous to other persons. For that offence I am sentencing you to sixteen months imprisonment. I understand you have not been in custody before today and I am dating it from today 16 November 2007 and it will expire on 15 May 2009. I set a balance of term of two years, fifteen days to expire on 30 May 2011. I regret that I cannot order your release to parole on 15 May 2009 because the sentence is longer than three years. But I strongly recommend to the Parole Board that they consider releasing you on your due date.104. I also recommend to those who are taking her into custody to recognise her age and organise, as quickly as possible, her classification to a minimum prison institution. 105. I note that there is a further matter of negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm that has been referred to this court pursuant to s 166.BOROSH: Thank you your Honour I’d seek leave to withdraw that charge.HIS HONOUR: Leave is given to withdraw the charge.BOROSH: There is also the matter of disqualification your Honour.HIS HONOUR: A standard period of three years?BOROSH: Three years, there is a minimum period your Honour of twelve months.HIS HONOUR: I intend to impose the three years. The offender will be disqualified from driving, I understand she has not been driving since the motor vehicle accident?BOROSH: I believe was the evidence, yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: That was 24 October?BOROSH: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: She is disqualified from holding a licence for three years from 25 October 2006. That period of disqualification will expire on 24 October 2009.106. [Addressed to custodial officers present in court] It must be obvious from the remarks I have made, if you have listened to them, she is a relatively fragile person and you will need to take some care of her.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This Court rejected an attempt by the Crown to appeal from an acquittal by directed verdict in favour of the Respondent. (See R v JS [2007] NSWCCA 272.) This Court held that the creation by statute of a right on the part of the Crown to appeal from such an acquittal by amendment of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 in 2006, did not operate retrospectively. This Court also held, in the alternative, that the trial judge was correct to direct a verdict. Other contentions on the part of the Respondent were rejected. 
     
      
    2 When judgment was handed down leave was reserved to the Respondent to make an application seeking an order for costs. Submissions have been filed by the Respondent and the Appellant. The parties agreed that the issue would be determined on the papers. 
     
      
    3 The Court of Criminal Appeal is a statutory court which has such powers as are expressly conferred on it or are implied from the express conferral of jurisdiction upon, and grant of powers to, the Court. As I indicated in John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of New South Wales (2004) 61 NSWLR 344 at [28] it is usual to refer to a statutory court as having an implied jurisdiction. (See Jackson v Sterling Industries Limited (1987) 162 CLR 612 at 623-634.) An alternative formulation is that it has “incidental statutory powers”. (Linprint Pty Limited v Hexham Textiles Pty Limited (1991) 23 NSWLR 508 at 515B.)  
     
      
    4 The Respondent submitted that, subject only to s17 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, to which I will refer below, this Court’s power to award costs is “generally at large”. This submission should be rejected. It is necessary to identify an express or implied statutory power to make such an order. 
     
      
    5 At a time when the powers conferred on this Court were to be found only in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, this Court held that it “has no powers except those conferred upon it by that statute”. (R v Burns (1920) 20 SR (NSW) 351 at 358.) Subsequently, other statutes have conferred powers on this Court. (See Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Cassaniti [2006] NSWCCA 335; (2006) 204 FLR 152 at [12]-[13].) The Respondent has failed to identify any relevant statutory provision. 
     
      
    6 As part of its implied jurisdiction this Court has power to control abuse of its process and, as an incident of that power, may order a person who has abused that process to pay the other party’s costs, at least where s17 of the Criminal Appeal Act does not apply. (See Markisic v Vizza [2002] NSWCCA 53 at [31]-[33].) The Appellant’s conduct could not be said to constitute an abuse of process. (C/f Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Roslyndale Shipping Company Pty Limited [2004] NSWCCA 262; 148 A Crim R 341 at [15].) 
     
      
    7 The Respondent submitted that Proust v Blake (1989) 17 NSWLR 267 is authority for the proposition that this Court has power to award costs where it has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. In that case this Court did make an order for costs, but did so by applying the express power in s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act to the effect that, upon reference of a question of law by a judge of the District Court, this Court could “make any such order … as it thinks fit”.  
     
      
    8 The Respondent’s submissions suggest that Proust v Blake was authority for the proposition that the Court has power to award costs when it has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal, in respect of which a costs order is sought, and that this case was relevantly the same. This ignores the reliance on s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act in Proust v Blake, which provided the statutory basis for making an award. (Applying Clyne v Wrigley (1980) 1 NSWLR 599.) The Respondent was unable to identify any such basis in the present case. 
     
      
    9 I do not suggest that s5B and the power to control abuse of its process exhausts the range of circumstances in which this Court may order costs. Nevertheless, it is necessary to identify an express or implied power and the Respondent has not done so. 
     
      
    10 This appeal was brought in purported reliance on s107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, which permits a Crown appeal in the case of a directed acquittal. The Court held that this section was not retrospective and accordingly did not affect the present proceedings. Section 107 is in Pt 8 of the Act on the subject of Acquittals. There is no express provision in this Part empowering the Court to make any order for costs. This contrasts with other provisions in the Act where an express power is included.  
     
      
    11 The Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act was originally only concerned with regulating appeals to, and review by, the Local Court, the District Court, the Land and Environment Court and single judges of the Supreme Court. Subsequent amendment has added references to appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act makes express provision with respect to costs in the case of appeals from the Local Court to the District Court (s16(3), s28(3) and s70); from the Local Court to the Land and Environment Court (s36(3), s46(2) and s70); and from the Local Court to the Supreme Court (s54(3), s58(3), s59(2) and s70). It makes no such provision in Pt 8 of the Act with respect to an appeal to this Court. 
     
      
    12 This is one of those situations in which the expressio unius rule of interpretation is applicable. (See e.g. Ex parte Rose v Ward (1965) 83 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 412 at 416-417.) Furthermore, the detailed provision in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act reflects the basic proposition that the power to award costs in a criminal case requires statutory authority. At common law, and traditionally, costs were not awarded in criminal proceedings. (See e.g. Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534 esp at 557; R v Mosely (1992) 28 NSWLR 735 at 738-740; R v Goia (1988) 19 FCR 212 at 213-214; R v Scott (1993) 42 FCR 1 at 11-13.)  
     
      
    13 Subsequently, provisions empowering a Court to award costs in a criminal case have been adopted in a range of contexts. Courts have become more familiar with awarding costs in such cases and, accordingly, have manifested a preparedness to interpret a provision conferring a power in general terms, such as a power to make any order that the Court thinks fit, as encompassing a power to award costs. (See Proust v Blake supra and Byrnes v Barry [2004] ACTCA 24; (2004) 150 A Crim R 471 at [65]-[95].) No such provision has been identified in the present proceedings. Nor has any other power been identified to which an award of costs could be said to be an incident. 
     
      
    14 The traditional common law position that costs are not awarded in criminal proceedings is reflected in s17 of the Criminal Appeal Act (see R v Mosley supra at 739) which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “17(1) On the hearing or determination of an appeal, or any proceedings preliminary or incidental thereto under this Act, no costs shall be allowed on either side.” 
        
       
      
    15 The Appellant relies upon this section in the alternative to the general proposition that costs in criminal cases require express or implied statutory authorisation. Whether as an alternative basis, or as affirming the reasoning I have already set out, the Appellant’s submissions in this respect should be upheld. 
     
      
    16 The Respondent contends that the present case is not a proceeding “under this Act” and, accordingly, s17 has no direct application. This submission should be rejected. The words “under this Act” appear within a distinct clause between the commas immediately before the word “or” and after the word “Act”. As a matter of grammar the words “under this Act” refer to the words “proceedings preliminary or incidental thereto”. In my opinion, they do qualify the reference to “an appeal” in the first clause of s17(1).  
     
      
    17 It may be the case that when the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 was first enacted all appeals to this Court proceeded pursuant to that Act. However, the Act regulated the general procedure of this Court and is, generally, readily adaptable to the conferral of appeal rights to this Court under other legislation. The reference to “an appeal” does not, as a matter of textual analysis, need to be restricted to an appeal solely under the Criminal Appeal Act itself and should not be. The procedural provisions of the Act, including s17, should be applied to any scheme pursuant to which appeals are brought to this Court. (As distinct from proceedings which cannot be called an appeal at all, as in Markisic v Vizza supra.) 
     
      
    18 In my opinion, s17 is an alternative and complete answer to the Respondent’s submission that this Court has power to make an order for costs. 
     
      
    19 Alternatively, it is appropriate for this Court to consider the exercise of the discretion to award costs if it had the power to do so. The Respondent does not, correctly, suggest that there is any general rule in criminal proceedings that costs should follow the event. A discretion, assuming it exists, to award costs must take into account the full range of relevant considerations. I proceed on the assumption that, as the Respondent submitted, the discretion is at large. 
     
      
    20 The Respondent relied on the reasoning of the High Court in Latoudis v Casey supra esp at 542-543, 544, 566-567 and 569 in which observations were made, particularly concerning the compensatory nature of an order for costs as distinct from such being awarded by way of punishment.  
     
      
    21 The Respondent relied particularly on the fact that it had taken steps to restrict the scope of the appeal to the jurisdictional issues which it wished to argue, so that the costs involved in considering the Criminal Code issue (see R v JS supra at [120]-[159]) would not arise, such as the preparation of appeal books for the whole case. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion, if not majority, of the time involved in the written submissions and the oral submissions in this Court, was focused upon the issues raised under the Constitution and the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), on which issues the Respondent’s submissions were rejected. 
     
      
    22 On these two issues which took a substantial proportion, if not a majority, of the time in preparation and in oral submissions this Court held, at [85]-[92] and [93]-[119] respectively, that it should follow prior decisions, precisely in point, of another intermediate Court of Criminal Appeal. High Court authority required this Court to do so unless it came to the view that the prior decisions were plainly wrong. This Court could not come to such a view when there was clear support in reasoning in the High Court, albeit not majority reasoning, that supported the conclusions of the earlier decisions. In these circumstances the submissions based on these alternative matters should have been formal submissions. The fact that they took up such a large proportion, probably a majority, of the time of this Court is such that the discretion as to costs should not be exercised in favour of the Respondent and Applicant for a costs order. 
     
      
    23 The Respondent’s application for costs should be dismissed.

      14997/07 O’SHANE v BURWOOD LOCAL COURT (NSW) & ORS 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The claimant, Patricia O’Shane, has brought proceedings in which she challenges an order made in the Burwood Local Court by the first opponent. Although the precise terms of the order are unclear, the effect was a “pseudonym order” in respect of a person identified as “Ms B”. 
     
      
    2 The order was made in proceedings brought by a constable of police in which initially an order was sought pursuant to s 562F of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). That section provides for the making of an apprehended domestic violence order (“ADVO”) against someone with whom the “applicant” has or has had a “domestic relationship”, as defined in s 562B. 
     
      
    3 The written application also sought a non-publication order in relation to the names of certain persons. The request was framed in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Police respectfully request that the court grant an order that under s 562ZK of the Crimes Act, to prevent the name of O’SHANE, [Ms B] or COLE being published or broadcast by the media, as the last time an AVO was applied for, all parties were subject to intense media scrutiny.” 
        
       
      
    4 The proceedings came before the magistrate on Friday, 21 September 2007. Because the proceedings did not relate to a “domestic relationship” the application was amended so that it became an application for an apprehended personal violence order (“APVO”) pursuant to s 562J of the Act. 
     
      
    5 During the course of the hearing on 21 September 2007, a number of further matters were considered. Counsel had originally sought an interim AVO which led to consideration of whether the application itself was evidence of the matters alleged in it. In the course of the discussion the magistrate said that it was not and that before an order could be made “[i]t will be necessary in my view, for there to be evidence before the court. Sworn evidence.” There was further discussion during which the magistrate said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, what evidence do you intend to rely upon to make the order? And don’t tell me you are just relying upon the application because the application is not evidence.” 
        
       
      
    6 Subsequently, counsel did not press the application for interim orders. However, the application for suppression orders was pursued although ultimately confined to a request for pseudonym orders. 
     
      
    7 Counsel conceded a lack of standing to seek a pseudonym order in respect of the claimant but pressed the application in relation Ms B and her partner, Mr Cole. 
     
      
    8 There had been earlier proceedings in which Mr Cole sought ADVO orders against Ms O’Shane. They were considered in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Ryde Local Court (2005) 62 NSWLR 512. In those proceedings orders were made by consent, with no application being made for a pseudonym order or any other order suppressing the details of the application or hearing. 
     
      
    9 The standing of the claimant in relation to the application for pseudonym orders was considered by the magistrate. Her Honour eventually ruled that, as the application was being made by the police on behalf of Ms B, Ms O’Shane was not a party and her counsel was not entitled to appear. Nevertheless the magistrate granted counsel the opportunity to make submissions as a “friend of the court.” 
     
      
    10 The ruling by the magistrate was not correct. Ms O’Shane was a party to the primary proceedings and had a right to be heard in relation to any interim or ancillary orders. Counsel for the police conceded the claimant’s standing in this Court. 
     
      
    11 Because the basis for the AVO had changed counsel for Ms O’Shane submitted that she was not prepared to deal with the matter on 21 September. She asked that the matter be stood over. The magistrate rejected the application for adjournment and proceeded to determine the application for a pseudonym order. She took this course because, in my view correctly, she was concerned that the AVO application having been made to the court unless a pseudonym order was made that day there would be no purpose in it being made later. Without an order the press would be able to publish Ms B’s name.  
     
      
    12 As I have indicated the application was originally framed as an application for an ADVO. Accordingly, the statutory power to make an order in the nature of a pseudonym order was available under s 562ZK. However, when the application was amended to seek an APVO s 562ZK was not available. Counsel for the police submitted that the magistrate had power to make the order exercising “the implied powers of the court to suppress.” She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is late in the day on a Friday, perhaps I can make it clear and simple, what I am proposing acknowledges and allows for the public interest and the open administration of justice, the proceedings would be heard in open court, there would be no suppression of the evidence, and that could be reported on which is where the public interest in my submission really lies. All I seek is the legitimate protection of someone who is subject to a storm of media attention last time I, in my submission don’t need evidence of that, because it is clear from the authority of John Fairfax and Ryde Local Court, the extent of the media interest.” 
        
       
      
    13 This statement by counsel that she did not intend to tender any evidence was accompanied by reference to the decision in John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Local Court of New South Wales (1991) 26 NSWLR 131. That case was concerned with the inference that a court could draw from its own knowledge of the consequences that may flow if publicity is given to the evidence of an informer or victims in blackmail and extortion cases. The decision is not authority for a proposition that evidence is not required of the primary facts.  
     
      
    14 Counsel further submitted that “the consequences that will flow from public identification of the person in need of protection and her partner will be unacceptable.” When asked by the magistrate to explain what the consequences would be, counsel responded that “there isn’t evidence on this point before your Honour, and I will tender confidentially the complaint if required, your Honour saw this morning the media interest in the court.” That submission was followed by these remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am instructed your Honour there was a camp out, outside her house for a month. The last time this application was made in 2004, besieged by the media. 
         
         
        Really harassment of such seriousness that well, let me just say, serious, serious intent, media attention.”  
        
       
      
    15 Counsel submitted that a pseudonym order would provide Ms B with a measure of protection, by preventing the publication of her name or any other information such as photographs of her that would identify her. Counsel also made mention of Ms B’s children as a further relevant consideration, namely that “[Ms B] has a 16 year old and a 20 year old and if her name is disclosed that inevitably leads to identification of her children, both of whom I am instructed live at home with her.” Counsel also submitted that a pseudonym order should be made with Ms B’s occupation in mind, so that “her professional life won’t then be public.” No detail of her professional life was provided. 
     
      
    16 Her Honour heard brief submissions from counsel for Ms O’Shane. She then adjourned. Upon her return, her Honour expressed her conclusions in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “It is essentially an ex tempore decision that I give today. 
         
         
        In respect of the application before the court, consideration always must be given as to whether the private interest outweighs the public interest. 
         
         
        The matter before the court is a proceeding that is characterised as a civil matter, whereby there has been an application made for an apprehended personal violence order by the police, on behalf of [Ms B]. 
         
         
        The respondent to these proceedings is a New South Wales judicial officer. 
         
         
        Proceedings similar to these have been instituted previously, and as a matter of record attracted significant media attention, given the office held by the respondent. 
         
         
        I am told through the course of the application for the pseudonym order that [Ms B] also suffered the scrutiny of the media with members of the press to use their words, put to the court, camping outside her premises for approximately one month. This is an unacceptable situation. 
         
         
        I am being asked to make an order today applying a pseudonym in order to protect [Ms B] from the likelihood of similar conduct following the initiation of these proceedings. 
         
         
        The use of the pseudonym will not prevent the reporting of the proceedings, but it will prevent [Ms B] from being identified throughout media broadcast or publication. 
         
         
        The paramount consideration in this application is the need to security [sic] the proper administration of justice. 
         
         
        I am told that [Ms B] is seeking the protection of the court from the harassment from the media which is attracted or will be likely to be attracted to these proceedings, no doubt because of the office held by the respondent. 
         
         
        It is fair to say in all other aspects of these proceedings, they of themselves are unremarkable and would not otherwise attract the attention of the media. 
         
         
        The concern of this court is that if protection such as that being sought by [Ms B] is not extended, it may operate to defeat the proper administration of justice. It may be persons in the future who have genuine grievances against persons in public office, may be deterred from doing so because of the conduct of the media complained of in this instance by [Ms B]. 
         
         
        IT IS ON THAT BASIS THAT I PROPOSE TO MAKE A PSEUDONYM ORDER FOR THE PROTECTION OF [MS B], ONLY, TODAY. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        I am making a pseudonym order in respect of [Ms B] only on the basis that she is the person named as the person in need of protection.” 
        
       
       
      Present proceedings 
       
      
    17 In the proceedings before this Court the claimant seeks the following relief: 
     
      
       
      1. Relief in the nature of a declaration that the order of Mottley LCM of 21 September 2007, that “Ms B” be referred to only by that pseudonym was beyond power, void and is of no effect. 
       
      2. Relief in the nature of a declaration that the order of Mottley LCM of 21 September 2007, that “Ms B” be referred to only by that pseudonym was made relying on matters which were insufficient in law to warrant the making of the order. 
       
      3. Relief in the nature of certiorari quashing the order of Mottley LCM of 21 September 2007, for a pseudonym for “Ms B”. 
       
      4. An order that the opponents meet the claimant’s costs in these proceedings. 
       
      5. Such other orders as the Court thinks fit. 
       
      
    18 The grounds for relief were expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
      (1) There is error of law apparent on the face of the record of the proceedings and/or jurisdictional error as there was no power to make such order in the circumstances of the “APVO” before Mottley LCM. 
       
      (2) There is error of law apparent on the face of the record of the proceedings and/or jurisdictional error as Mottley LCM failed to apply a test of necessity in invoking the “power” to make the order. 
       
      (3) There is error of law apparent on the face of the record of the proceedings and/or jurisdictional error as there was no basis for the making of the order. 
       
      (4) There is error of law apparent on the face of the record of the proceedings and/or jurisdictional error as the order was made without any evidence being tendered in support of the application. 
       
      (5) There is error of law apparent on the face of the record of the proceedings and/or jurisdictional error as in making the order for a pseudonym, Mottley LCM failed to accord natural justice and/or procedural fairness to the claimant. 
       
      (6) There is error of law apparent on the face of the record of the proceedings and/or jurisdictional error as Mottley LCM had regard to matters, which were irrelevant to the application, namely, the profession of the claimant and her standing in the community. 
       
       
      The principle of open justice 
       
      
    19 The resolution of this dispute requires consideration of the principle of open justice and the occasions when it may be appropriate to suppress publicity to proceedings or an aspect of proceedings. They are well settled. In John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales (2004) 61 NSWLR 344 Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “[18 
        ] It is well established that the principle of open justice is one of the most fundamental aspects of the system of justice in Australia. The conduct of proceedings in public 
         including, relevantly, the taking of verdicts after a criminal trial,  
        is an essential quality of an Australian court of justice 
        . There is no inherent power of the court to exclude the public. (See  
        Scott v Scott 
         [1913] AC 417 at 473;  
        Dickason v Dickason 
         (1913) 17 CLR 50 at 51;  
        Daubney v Cooper 
         (1829) 10 B & C 237; 109 ER 438 at 440;  
        Russell v Russell 
         (1976) 134 CLR 495 especially at 507 and 520–521, 532.) The taking of a verdict is something which occurs in the ordinary course of criminal proceedings. (See, for example,  
        Coulter v The Queen 
         (1988) 164 CLR 350 at 356, 357 and cf 359–360, 362.) 
         
         
        [19]  
        It is also well established that the exceptions to the principle of open justice are few and strictly defined. 
         (See, for example,  
        McPherson v McPherson 
         [1936] AC 177 at 200;  
        R v Tate 
         (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 402.)  
        It is now accepted that the courts will not add to the list of exceptions but, of course, Parliament can do so, subject to any Constitutional constraints. 
         (See, for example,  
        Dickason 
         (at 51);  
        Russell 
         (at 520);  
        John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Attorney General (NSW) 
         (2000) 158 FLR 81 at 93 [70]–[73].) 
         
         
        [20]  
        The entitlement of the media to report on court proceedings is a corollary of the right of access to the court by members of the public. Nothing should be done to discourage fair and accurate reporting of proceedings. 
         (See, for example,  
        Attorney General v Leveller Magazine Ltd 
         [1979] AC 440 at 450.) 
         
         
        [21] 
          
        From time to time the courts do make orders that some aspect or aspects of court proceedings not be the subject of publication. Any such order must, in the light of the principle of open justice, be regarded as exceptional. (See, for example,  
        Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Jones 
         (1985) 2 NSWLR 47 at 50D–E and 54G.)” (emphases added) 
        
       
      
    20 In John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Ryde Local Court (2005) 62 NSWLR 512, Spigelman CJ said at [29]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The “principle of open justice” is a  
        principle 
        , 
          
        it is not a freestanding right… As a principle, it is of significance in guiding the court in determining a range of matters… However, it remains a principle and not a right.” ( 
        his Honour’s emphasis 
        ) 
        
       
      
    21 Open justice is important for the maintenance of accountability in the exercise of judicial power. However, the law also recognises that there may be circumstances when the court should act to prevent “unacceptable detriment to individuals and the proper administration of justice” (John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Local Court of New South Wales (1991) 26 NSWLR 131 at 164 per Mahoney JA). The open justice principle can be qualified where it is necessary so to do “commensurate with the purpose” for which the statutorily conferred jurisdiction exists (John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Local Court of New South Wales at 164 per Mahoney JA). 
     
      
       
      Legislative scheme 
       
      
    22 Provision was first made for apprehended violence orders in Pt 15A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) by the Crimes (Personal and Family Violence) Amendment Act 1987. From its inception Pt 15A only referred to apprehended violence orders in general terms. There was no distinction between orders relating to “domestic” problems from problems of a more general nature. The original legislation did not provide a mechanism to suppress the identity of persons seeking the protection of an AVO or those involved in AVO proceedings. 
     
      
    23 Amendments were made to Pt 15A by the Crimes Amendment (Apprehended Violence) Act 1999. Provision was made for two types of AVO’s, apprehended domestic violence orders (ADVOs, see Division 1A ss 562AC-562AE in force at the time) and the other apprehended personal violence orders (APVOs, see Division 1B ss 562AH-562AI in force at the time). Express provision was also made for the non-publication of the name of an adult person for whose benefit or against whom an order is sought in ADVO proceedings, or who appears as a witness or is mentioned or otherwise involved in ADVO proceedings (see s 562NC in force at the time). If an order was made the prohibition on the publication or broadcast of the names of these persons operated from the time before the ADVO proceedings commenced or after the proceedings commenced and before they were disposed of (s 562NC(1) in force at the time). A similar provision was not included in relation to APVO’s. 
     
      
    24 The intention of the legislature in providing two types of AVOs was stated in the Second Reading speech (Hansard, Legislative Council, 25 November 1999, p 3674): 
     
      
       
        
        “The seriousness of domestic violence and its effects on women, children and the community at large can be somewhat trivialised and minimised through association with matters such as neighbourhood and workplace disputes. The separation of these two categories of AVO is designed not only to recognise the difference in the nature and level of violence in domestic and non-domestic matters but to establish some significant legislative distinctions in the ways in which AVOs are dealt with according to their classification.” 
        
       
      
    25 Pt 15A was replaced in its entirety by the Crimes Amendment (Apprehended Violence) Act 2006 (NSW), which commenced on 12 March 2007.  
     
      
    26 It can be assumed that the legislature turned its mind to the question of suppression orders in relation to AVO’s. Section 562NC was replaced by s 562ZK but its content remains unchanged. It remains confined to ADVO proceedings. Section 562ZK is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A court may direct that the name of a person (other than a child to whom section 562ZJ applies): 
         
         
          
          (a) for whose protection or against whom an order is sought in any relevant proceedings, or 
           
          (b) who appears, or is reasonably likely to appear, as a witness before a court in any relevant proceedings, or 
           
          (c) who is, or is reasonably likely to be, mentioned or otherwise involved in any relevant proceedings, 
          
         
         
        must not be published or broadcast before the proceedings are commenced or after the proceedings have been commenced and before they are disposed of. 
         
         
        (2) A person who publishes or broadcasts the name of a person in contravention of a direction under subsection (1) is guilty of an offence.  
         
         
        Maximum penalty: 200 penalty units or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 2 years, or both (in the case of an individual) or 2,000 penalty units (in the case of a corporation). 
         
         
        (3) Subsection (1) does not prohibit: 
         
         
          
          (a) the publication or broadcasting of an official report of the proceedings of a court that includes the name of any person the publication or broadcasting of which would otherwise be prohibited by subsection (1), or 
           
          (b) the publication or broadcasting of the name of a person with the consent of the person or of the court. 
          
         
         
        (4) For the purposes of this section, a reference to the name of a person includes a reference to any information, picture or other material: 
         
         
        (a) that identifies the person, or 
         
          
          (b) that is likely to lead to the identification of the person. 
          
         
         
        ……… 
         
         
        (8) In this section: 
         
         
        court 
         includes the registrar of a Local Court or the Registrar of the Children’s Court. 
         
         
        relevant proceedings 
         means proceedings in or before a court under this Part for or relating to an apprehended domestic violence order.” 
        
       
      
    27 Because there is no express power in the legislation to suppress the name of a party or complainant in APVO proceedings counsel for the police submitted that either s 72 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) or the implied power of the court to protect its process would provide jurisdiction in the magistrate to make the pseudonym order. 
     
      
    28 Section 72 in Pt 6 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court may, by order, prohibit the publication or disclosure of any information tending to reveal the identity of: 
         
         
        (a) any party to proceedings, or 
         
        (b) any witness in proceedings, 
         
         
        if it is of the opinion that it is necessary to do so to secure the proper administration of justice in the proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    29 Section 72 is only available to a magistrate in the Local Court in proceedings falling into identified categories specified in Schedule 1 to the Civil Procedure Act (s 4). Applications for AVOs are described as application proceedings in the Local Court and are governed by Pt 6 of the Local Courts Act 1982 (NSW) (Pt 15A s 562ZQ). Schedule 1 to the Civil Procedure Act does not include such proceedings. Accordingly, s 72 is not available in relation to ADVO or APVO proceedings in the Local Court. 
     
      
       
      Implied powers 
       
      
    30 The absence of a statutory power to suppress the name of a party or witness does not exhaust the powers available to the Court. However, it is a significant indication that any other power which may be available should only be exercised after careful consideration of the circumstances. A superior court has an inherent power to make orders to protect its process. In Grassby v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 1 Dawson J said at 16: 
     
      
       
        
        “In Reg v Forbes; Ex parte Bevan [(1972) 127 CLR 1 at 7], Menzies J pointed out that: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ‘Inherent jurisdiction' is the power which a court has simply because it is a court of a particular description. Thus the Courts of Common Law without the aid of any authorizing provision had inherent jurisdiction to prevent abuse of their process and to punish for contempt. Inherent jurisdiction is not something derived by implication from statutory provisions conferring particular jurisdiction; if such a provision is to be considered as conferring more than is actually expressed that further jurisdiction is conferred by implication according to accepted standards of statutory construction and it would be inaccurate to describe it as `inherent jurisdiction', which, as the name indicates, requires no authorizing provision. Courts of unlimited jurisdiction have `inherent jurisdiction'."" 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Inherent jurisdiction is an elusive concept and the proposition that it arises from the nature of a court has been described as metaphysical. See  
        Yale Law Journal 
        , vol 57 (1947) 83, at p 85, cited by Jacob, ""The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court"",  
        Current Legal Problems 
        , vol 23 (1970) 23, at p 27. But it is undoubtedly the general responsibility of a superior court of unlimited jurisdiction for the administration of justice which gives rise to its inherent power. In the discharge of that responsibility it exercises the full plenitude of judicial power. It is in that way that the Supreme Court of New South Wales exercises an inherent jurisdiction. Although conferred by statute, its powers are identified by reference to the unlimited powers of the courts at Westminster.” 
        
       
      
    31 These powers have been utilised by courts to make orders concealing the identity of persons in limited circumstances. Orders have been made in relation to police informers, blackmail and national security matters (John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Local Court of New South Wales at 148 per Kirby P and 159 per Mahoney JA) 
     
      
    32 Unlike superior courts the powers of a statutory court are confined. In Grassby Dawson J confirmed that such a court was confined to the powers “necessary” for the effective exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by the statute. His Honour said at 16-17: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the other hand, a magistrate's court is an inferior court with a limited jurisdiction which does not involve any general responsibility for the administration of justice beyond the confines of its constitution. It is unable to draw upon the well of undefined powers which is available to the Supreme Court. However, notwithstanding that its powers may be defined,  
        every court undoubtedly possesses jurisdiction arising by implication upon the principle that a grant of power carries with it everything necessary for its exercise 
         (ubi aliquid conceditur, conceditur et id sine quo res ipsa esse non potest). Those implied powers may in many instances serve a function similar to that served by the inherent powers exercised by a superior court but they are derived from a different source and are limited in their extent. The distinction between inherent jurisdiction and jurisdiction by implication is not always made explicit, but it is…fundamental. 
        
       
       
        
        …… 
        
       
       
        
        It would be unprofitable to attempt to generalize in speaking of the powers which an inferior court must possess by way of necessary implication.  
        Recognition of the existence of such powers will be called for whenever they are required for the effective exercise of a jurisdiction which is expressly conferred but will be confined to so much as can be ""derived by implication from statutory provisions conferring particular jurisdiction"" 
        .” ( 
        emphases added 
        ) 
        
       
      
    33 The test of necessity was further considered by the High Court in Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal (NSW) (1999) 198 CLR 435 which related to the jurisdiction of the District Court. Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan J said at [51]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The term ""necessary"" in such a setting as this is to be understood in the sense given it by Pollock CB in Attorney-General v Walker, namely as identifying a power to make orders which are reasonably required or legally ancillary to the accomplishment of the specific remedies for enforcement provided in Div 4 of Pt 3 of the District Court Act. In this setting, the term ""necessary"" does not have the meaning of ""essential""; rather it is to be ""subjected to the touchstone of reasonableness"".” 
        
       
       
      (See also  
      John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Ryde Local Court 
       (2005) at [42].) 
       
      
    34 Where the open justice principle is engaged, a high level of strictness in applying the test of necessity is appropriate if the jurisdiction or power sought to be implied would, if exercised, result in closing the court or prohibiting the publication of any information (reasons, verdict or orders) about the proceedings (John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Ryde Local Court (2005) at [40]-[41] per Spigelman CJ). 
     
      
    35 The test for determining the scope of the jurisdiction, which arises by implication “upon the principle that a grant of power carries with it everything necessary for its exercise”, was considered in John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Local Court of New South Wales. In that case Mahoney JA (with whom Hope AJA agreed) concluded that Local Courts have the power to make pseudonym and analogous suppression orders in committal proceedings for extortion, which had not been one of the recognised common law categories where suppression of identity is warranted. His Honour articulated a number of reasons for that conclusion. 
    · Although Local Courts are creatures of statute and do not have inherent powers as superior courts of record do, implied powers are attributable to them by reason of the statutory conferral of jurisdiction upon them (at 160). 
     
      
    · The test for the identification or existence of an implied power is whether it is: really necessary to secure the proper administration of justice in the proceedings before a Local Court (at 161, adopting with approval the exposition of McHugh JA in John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Police Tribunal of NSW (1986) 5 NSWLR 465 at 476-477). This does not mean that if the relevant order is not made, the proceedings cannot continue or will collapse (at 161). 
     
      
    · The criterion “necessary to secure the proper administration of justice” focuses on what is necessary for the proper function of the court and aims to prevent consequences that are unacceptable. (at 161) 
     
      
    · To explain “consequences that are unacceptable”, his Honour referred to specific cases where superior courts of record have exercised their inherent jurisdiction to conceal the identity of persons, for example, cases involving police informers and blackmail victims. In such cases the orders seek to avoid damage to the victim and/or mischief to the public. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The kinds of consequences that, in this sense, will be seen as unacceptable may be gauged by those involved in the cases in which statutory courts have been accepted as having restricted powers.  
          Thus, there will be hardship on the informer or the security officer or the blackmail victim; the future supply of information from such persons will end or will be impeded; and it will be more difficult to obtain from such persons the evidence necessary to bring offenders before the courts and deal with them. 
           It is not necessary to attempt to state exhaustively the considerations relevant in this regard: it is to  
          considerations of this kind or of an analogous kind on which the principle stated by McHugh JA is based 
          .” (at 161, emphases added) 
          
         
        
       
      
    36 In relation to extortion cases Mahoney JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “if the identity of the victims was revealed, there [are] apt to be others (“copycat situations”) who would seek to extort money from these victims or from other potential victims, and that the investigation of the offences would be more difficult because of confusion between real and mischievous threats…” (at 163) 
        
       
      
    37 In John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of New South Wales (2004) 61 NSWLR 344 at [39]-[47] Spigelman CJ (with whom Handley JA and M W Campbell AJA agreed) referred to these reasons with approval and recognised their applicability to “well-established categories” such as those involving police informer and victims of blackmail. In relation to “police-informer-type” cases, his Honour cited R v Smith (1996) 86 A Crim R 308 where the Court of Criminal Appeal (constituted by Gleeson CJ, Clarke and Sheller JJA) said at 311: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, in certain circumstances the law recognises that a more important public interest is served by protecting information, or the identity of an informant, from disclosure in court. One such circumstance is involved in the practice, which has long since hardened into a rule of law, that the identity of police informers will be protected from disclosure… 
        The rationale of this form of public interest immunity is that, if it were not extended, sources of information would dry up and the prevention and detection of crime would be hindered 
        .” ( 
        emphases added 
        ) 
        
       
      
    38 In John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Local Court of New South Wales (1991) Kirby P identified the central characteristic in blackmail cases in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Blackmail arises where both  
        the extortioner and the victim share a guilty secret which the victim (to avoid shame, distress, embarrassment, hurt or other damage) wishes to keep from the public  
        or a section of the public. This is not a feature of extortion cases, as such. There, the victim is oppressed by the extortioner who threatens dire consequences. But those consequences are not the revelation to the public of a guilty secret. This difference removes one of the important inhibitions which exists in the case of blackmail (or police informers) against the revelation of facts in open court.  
        If such revelation were required, out of deference to the principle of openness, the blackmail would have succeeded or, to avoid that risk, the victim and the informant would likely not come forward 
        . Nothing of the same inhibition exists in cases of extortion.” (at 148-149,  
        emphases added 
        )

      [1975] 1 QB 637 at 644, 652 per Lord Widgery CJ discussing the rationale for non-disclosure of the names of blackmail victims;  
      John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales  
      (2004) per Spigelman CJ at [48]). 
       
      
    39 In R v Kwok (2005) 64 NSWLR 335 the controversy related to suppression of the name and identity of several complainant-witnesses in District Court proceedings for the prosecution of offences under the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) relating to female persons taken into sexual servitude. Hodgson JA (with whom Howie and Rothman JJ agreed) decided that a non-publication order could be made because “there is an extremely close analogy with the crime of blackmail” (at [18]). His Honour made the following observations: 
     
      
    § “The only power in the District Court to make an order directed to non-publication of a witness’s name is such power as may be implied as being necessary for the administration of justice.” (at [12], relying on John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Local Court of New South Wales (1991) 26 NSWLR 131; John Fairfax Publication Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales (2004) 61 NSWLR 344).” 
     
      
    § “The assimilation of this kind of crime to the existing established categories is not primarily to protect the victims from shame or embarrassment, but is rather to reduce the disincentive upon victims against reporting such crimes and thereby to reduce the support given by this disincentive to this kind of criminal activity (at [20]).” 
     
      
    § “The Court will not freely invent new categories of cases, but in my opinion the Court may identify categories that, while not coinciding exactly with the existing categories, are very closely analogous to them and have the same rationale for the making of non-publication orders (at [16]).” 
     
      
    40 Witness v Marsden (2000) 49 NSWLR 429 concerned a witness who was a prisoner and had fears for his life and physical safety if he gave evidence without the protection of a pseudonym order. The court considered inter alia whether “the ends of justice would be defeated if the pseudonym order was not made” (at [114] per Heydon JA with whom Mason P and Priestley JA agreed). 
     
      
    41 With respect to the relevant principle, Heydon JA said at [144]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is necessary that there be a minimalist interference with open justice to the extent of pseudonym orders in favour of the Witness. That is because without them the Witness reasonably fears death or physical injury, or alternatively an unnecessary loss of liberty. These are evils, which it is necessary to avoid by that degree of minimalist interference. Without the orders, the Witness is exposed to hurt, and the party calling him is faced with the risk of testimony proceeding from a person who is reluctant, but in a particular sense. Many witnesses, as the plaintiff pointed out, are reluctant, but few are reluctant because of fears for their lives, safety or liberty.” 
        
       
      
    42 In the blackmail, informer and extortion cases the justification for pseudonym orders is to ensure that crime can be effectively investigated and prosecuted. Unless protection is provided the administration of justice will be compromised. As Mahoney JA said in John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Local Court of New South Wales at 163: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he open conduct of the courts is not an end in itself: the principle is adopted because it is seen as a means of achieving the fundamental end, the proper administration of justice.” 
        
       
      
    43 The question in the present case is whether in relation to a person who it is submitted requires the protection of an APVO, a pseudonym order may similarly be justified. That question must be answered mindful of the fact that although the legislature has authorised the making of suppression orders, pursuant to s 562ZK of the Crimes Act, in relation to ADVO’s it has not done so in relation to APVO’s. 
     
      
       
      The submissions and resolution of the application 
       
      
    44 It was submitted by the respondents that because of the likelihood of publicity of the proceedings and possible harassment by the press it was in the interests of justice that the name of the complainant should be suppressed. It was submitted that it could be inferred from the media interest in the earlier proceedings (see John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Ryde Local Court) that the media would be similarly interested in the current proceedings. It was said from the bar table that the media had camped outside Ms B’s house. However, there was no evidence that this had occurred nor that anything untoward had taken place.  
     
      
    45 It was submitted that because Ms O’Shane is a magistrate the media would have a heightened interest in the matter. It was further submitted that unless the publication of Ms B’s name was prohibited the knowledge that her matter had been given considerable publicity may deter others from bringing similar proceedings. The ultimate submission was that where the person complained of in AVO proceedings is well known, with the consequence that publicity is likely to follow, the interests of justice justifies the suppression of the complainant’s name. 
     
      
    46 There are two questions which require consideration. They are essentially related. The first question is whether the granting of a pseudonym order is necessary to secure the proper administration of justice. In the cases where an implied power to make pseudonym orders has been recognised – particularly those relating to blackmail, informers and extortion – the court has been satisfied that if an order were not made the consequence would be “unacceptable” (John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Local Court of New South Wales at 161). The consequences which have justified an order are the safety, livelihood or reputation of a victim or witness as a result of giving evidence in the proceedings. In the case of informers, revelation of their identities has been accepted as potentially undermining other investigations (including covert operations), posing a threat to their safety with the prospective prejudice to the prosecution of crime. In blackmail cases, if the identity of the “victim” is not protected they may be vulnerable to other “blackmailers” or reluctant to report the crime. By protecting the “victim” in one case the court encourages other incidents of blackmail in other cases to be reported. 
     
      
    47 To my mind the mere fact that publicity is unpleasant could not justify the suppression of a person’s identity. Keen or even intense interest by the media does not of itself compromise the administration of justice. Undoubtedly there are occasions when media interest results in unnecessarily intrusive behaviour by members of the press. However, there is no reason to assume that the press will act irresponsibly. If press behaviour imposes unacceptable intrusions, and as was suggested in submissions, may extend to trespass on Ms B’s property the police are available to provide appropriate protection. The essence of the submission was not that the interests of justice would be diminished if the public were aware of Ms B’s name but that the level of media interest in the matter may cause members of the press to wait outside Ms B’s home to capture photographs or try and gain an interview. Although if this was to occur it would no doubt be unpleasant, it cannot justify the court in intervening to confine the reporting of proceedings, including the names of the parties. 
     
      
    48 The courts will not add to the list of categories (John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales at [19]) and the present case does not fall within any of the identified categories justifying a pseudonym order. The magistrate was informed that Ms B had suffered the scrutiny of the media in relation to the previous AVO including journalists “camped” outside Ms B’s premises “for approximately one month.” Her Honour said this was an unacceptable situation. For this reason her Honour concluded that unless a pseudonym order was made “it may operate to defeat the proper administration of justice.” The foundation for this conclusion appears to have been a concern that unless an order was made “persons in the future who have genuine grievances against persons in public office, may be deterred from doing so because of the conduct of the media.” 
     
      
    49 In my opinion this conclusion cannot be accepted. If this principle was adopted it would have the consequence that, without being publicly identified, a person under absolute privilege could make allegations against another person holding public office. Publicity would no doubt attend the making of the allegations and the person against whom they were made could be identified. The more sensational the allegations and the greater the prominence of the person against whom they were made the more likely they would be to attract publicity. Although an order may be made protecting the name of the “complainant” the person against whom the allegations are made will, of course, know the details of the allegation and the person making them. The prohibition from publication of the name of the complainant will be of no consequence as between the parties.  
     
      
    50 The inconvenience, irritation or distress which may be suffered by Ms B due to media scrutiny is not a consequence of a kind that would undermine the proper administration of justice in hearing and determining APVO applications. There are remedies available to Ms B should the press transgress acceptable levels of intrusion or break the law. In the words of Lord Widgery CJ in R v Socialist Worker Printers and Publishers Ltd; Ex parte Attorney-General at 644 it cannot be said that “experience shows that grave difficulty may be suffered in getting complainants to come forward” unless pseudonym orders are made. 
     
      
    51 The values inherent in the principle of open justice would be seriously compromised if parties were able to conceal their identities merely because of a heightened degree of media interest in the proceedings, aroused by the involvement of a person with a high public profile. It may be argued that in relation to proceedings which are of greater than usual interest to the public it may be more important, except in a most unusual case, that there be no impediment to the public being informed of all relevant aspects of the proceedings including the names of the parties and witnesses. In John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Local Court of New South Wales Kirby P said at 143: 
     
      
       
        
        “A significant reason for adhering to a stringent principle, despite sympathy for those who suffer embarrassment, invasions of privacy or even damage by publicity of their proceedings is that such interests must be sacrificed to the greater public interest in adhering to an open system of justice. Otherwise, powerful litigants may come to think that they can extract from courts or prosecuting authorities protection greater than that enjoyed by ordinary parties whose problems come before the courts and may be openly reported.” 
        
       
      
    52 In R v Kwok Howie J said at [32]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is important in light of the material relied upon by the prosecution to stress that it is the interests of justice that lie at the heart of such an application and not the interests of a private individual, such as a witness or an accused. The decided cases have emphasised the value of open courts to maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice. Open justice encompasses the right of the media to fully and frankly report cases before the courts,  
        even at the expense of the personal feelings of those involved in judicial proceedings 
        , including the innocent complainant.” ( 
        emphases added 
        ) 
        
       
      
    53 In any event before an implied power to suppress the name and identity of a person is engaged, evidence is required. In John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Local Court of New South Wales (1991), Mahoney JA explained the limited circumstances in which the court would infer an unacceptable outcome justifying intervention. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “But it was suggested in argument for the media interests that there was no evidence that such consequences will flow in any extortion case and nothing to show that they would flow in the present cases. The submission was that it could not be concluded that such consequences would flow. 
        
       
       
        
        It has not been the practice of the courts to require evidence that the consequences conventionally attributed to, for example, the disclosure of names in blackmail, security or informer cases, will actually flow. The courts have inferred that they will. No doubt, if it were to be suggested in a particular case that they would not, that could be the subject of proof. The same position should, in my opinion, obtain in respect of extortion cases of the present kind: no reason has been suggested for a different approach.” (at 163) 
        
       
      
    54 Even if there was power to make the pseudonym order there was simply no evidence of the allegations relied upon to justify it. The issue raised before the magistrate fell outside any principle accepted by the law and if the court was to be asked to draw inferences as to the likely future conduct of the press evidence of facts from which those inferences could be drawn would be required. There was no evidence before the magistrate which entitled her Honour to draw any inference let alone one which justified the making of the order. 
     
      
    55 It was submitted to the magistrate that because the proceedings involved a fellow magistrate they must be determined by other than a New South Wales magistrate. Her Honour accepted the force of this submission but nevertheless proceeded to hear the application for a suppression order. Her Honour no doubt took this course because, as I have indicated, the matter of the suppression order had to be determined on that day if it was to have any utility. 
     
      
    56 The claimant repeated to this Court the submission made in the Local Court. It is unnecessary for me to resolve the issue. However, I am inclined to the view that the magistrate had no alternative but to exercise the jurisdiction. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    57 It follows that both because there was no power and because of the lack of any evidence the pseudonym order made by the magistrate should be quashed. Accordingly, I am of the opinion the following orders, pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), should be made: 
     
      
       
      1. The pseudonym order made in relation to the identity of Miss Armstrong is quashed. 
       
      2. I order the 2nd and 3rd opponents to pay the claimant’s costs.  
       
      3. Direct that the 2nd and 3rd opponents may, if qualified, have a certificate under the  
      Suitors’ Fund Act.

     HEALTH CARE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION v WINGATE 
     
     
      
     
     
     Headnote 
    The Appellant, the Health Care Complaints Commission, made three complaints to the Medical Tribunal against the Respondent, Dr Wingate. The Appellant complained, first, that the Respondent was “guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct and/or professional misconduct”; secondly, that he was “not of good character”; and thirdly, that he “has been convicted of an offence, the circumstances of which render him unfit in the public interest to practise medicine”.The conduct forming the basis of the complaints was the possession of child pornography, for which the Respondent was convicted on 3 February 2005. The conviction related to 66 images which were discovered when, upon execution of a search warrant on 26 September 2004, the Respondent informed police of the presence of the images on the external hard drive of his home computer. Subsequently, some 10,000 additional images were located on the internal hard drives of the Respondent’s computers, which he had failed to bring to the attention of police. The late discovery of this material did not lead to any further charges.The Medical Tribunal found that the relevant conduct did not fall within the definition of unsatisfactory professional conduct in s 36 of the Medical Practice Act and therefore could not constitute professional misconduct under s 37 of the Act. The Tribunal dismissed the complaint that the Respondent was not of good character. The Tribunal was not satisfied that the circumstances of the conviction rendered him unfit in the public interest to practise medicine and upheld the third complaint on a limited basis only.The Tribunal ordered that the Respondent must not attend upon a person of less than 18 years of age without the presence of a chaperone; that he continue treatment with a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist; and that he be reprimanded in respect of his downloading of the pornographic images of children and failure to provide the Medical Board with accurate information relating to the circumstances of the offence.The issues for determination on appeal were:(i) whether the Tribunal erred in dismissing the complaint that the Respondent was not of good character; 
    (ii) whether the Tribunal misdirected itself by taking account of the fact that the Respondent had been “dealt with by the criminal law”; and(iii) whether there was error in permitting the Respondent to continue to treat persons under 18 years of age whilst requiring a “chaperone”.The Court held, allowing the appeal in part:In relation to (i)(per Basten JA, McColl JA and Harrison J agreeing)1. The Appellant identifying no error in the statement by the Medical Tribunal of the legal principles relating to want of good character, the orders made did not reveal error in point of law: [51].2. The privilege against self-incrimination does not entitle a practitioner to make untruthful or misleading statements nor, if the practitioner declines to answer particular questions, will it prevent the Medical Board or a tribunal taking steps in order to protect a relevant public interest: [45].(per Basten JA, Harrison J agreeing, McColl JA not deciding) 
    3. There may be a doubt whether a professional obligation of candour overrides the general law privilege against self-incrimination, absent an express statutory provision or a necessary implication arising from statute to that effect. [50].

    (per Basten JA, McColl JA and Harrison J agreeing)In relation to (ii)4. It cannot be said as a matter of general principle that a professional disciplinary tribunal should disregard any penalty imposed under the criminal law. The fact that disciplinary orders are commonly characterised as “protective” does not deny that they have punitive effects, nor does it require that the fact of criminal punishment must be disregarded. The Tribunal, having acknowledged the criminal punishment, appropriately held that a further recognition of the seriousness of the misconduct was necessary: [54]-[56].

Legislation imposing controls on employment of persons convicted of child pornography offences create statutory presumptions that such persons pose a risk to the safety of children and that there is a relationship between conduct constituting such an offence and the provision of professional services in health and various other support services: [72].8. Although the Tribunal was not required to determine whether, under the legislation relating to controls on employment of persons convicted of child pornography offences, the practitioner was prohibited from supplying health services to patients under 18 years, it should have treated the legislative scheme as part of the legal background against which the exercise of its discretion in making orders was to be considered. The Tribunal should have considered whether it was satisfied that the provision of services to young patients “posed no risk” to them and, if not so satisfied, there should have been a reasoned justification for not imposing a condition which would have the same effect as the statutory prohibition: [73].9. As it was agreed by both parties that a condition prohibiting the practitioner from treating patients under 18 years of age would not infringe Health Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield, the Tribunal should have imposed such a condition, absent some justification for not doing so: [75]-[76], [78].IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOURT OF APPEAL

     HEALTH CARE COMPLAINTS COMMISSION v WINGATE 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCOLL JA: I have had the benefit of reading in draft Basten JA’s reasons. I express no view as to whether a professional obligation of full and frank disclosure extends to the process instituted by the Medical Board (Basten JA at [50]). Subject to the above I agree with his Honour’s reasons and with the orders he proposes. 
     
      
    2 BASTEN JA: The appeal in this matter arose out of proceedings in the Medical Tribunal involving three complaints against Dr Wingate (“the practitioner”) made by the Health Care Complaints Commission (“the Commission”) pursuant to s 39 of the Medical Practice Act 1992 (NSW). The conduct which formed the basis of the complaints was the possession of child pornography on 26 September 2004 and a subsequent conviction for possession of child pornography, the conviction being entered at Sutherland Local Court on 3 February 2005. 
     
      
    3 The practitioner’s possession of a significant number of pornographic images on his home computer was discovered upon the execution of a search warrant on 26 September 2004. Following the discovery of the images, the practitioner was interviewed by police and charged on the same day with one count of possessing child pornography, which was particularised by reference to 66 images. The images were chosen from a total of some 600 images contained on an external hard drive to the practitioner’s computer. The images chosen were those considered by police most clearly to fall within the definition of “child pornography” in s 578B of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which provision (since repealed) was the source of the offence with which the practitioner was charged. 
     
      
    Issues4 The first issue raised by the Commission involves a challenge to the dismissal of a complaint that the practitioner was not of good character. The basis of the challenge was that the only complaint upheld was a complaint that he had been convicted of a criminal offence but that the orders, which included two reprimands, went beyond the terms of the conviction and therefore indicated that the Tribunal had implicitly held the practitioner to be not of good character. This issue is addressed at [25]-[51] below. 
     
      
    5 The second issue concerned the orders made by the Tribunal which are set out at [20] below. The Commissioner asserted that the Tribunal had misdirected itself by taking account of the fact that the practitioner had been “dealt with by the criminal law”. That error, it was contended, resulted in the Tribunal imposing a less severe sanction than was appropriate in the circumstances of the case. This issue is dealt with at [52]-[56]. 
     
      
    6 The third issue concerned order (1), the complaint being that it was made in breach of the rules of procedural fairness, the parties not having been given an opportunity to address its terms. Although the third issue was identified in this limited way by senior counsel for the Commission in opening the appeal, in fact the argument in relation to order (1) extended beyond the procedural fairness question to the substantive issue of the propriety of the order: see, eg, appeal Tcpt, 26/10/07 at p 52(5)-54(5). Order (1) imposed a condition on the registration of the practitioner requiring the presence of a third person when the practitioner attended upon a person of less than 18 years of age. The Commission submitted that, if the character complaint were not upheld and the practitioner could not be deregistered, the relevant condition should have involved an unqualified prohibition against treating persons under 18 years of age. This issue is dealt with at [57]-[78] below. 
     
      
    7 In my view the appeal should be rejected so far as the first two issues are concerned but should be upheld in relation to the third issue, though not on the basis that there had been failure to accord procedural fairness. 
     
      
    Complaints under the Medical Practice Act8 On 6 October 2004 the police notified the Medical Board (“the Board”) that the practitioner had been charged with the possession of child pornography. On 21 October, Dr Andrew Dix, the Registrar of the Board, made a complaint by way of a statutory declaration to the Commission stating that the practitioner “may be guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct and/or professional misconduct”. The Board also took steps, on 29 October 2004, to impose conditions on the practitioner’s registration, to which further reference will be made below. 
     
      
    9 On 18 November 2004 the practitioner pleaded guilty to the criminal charge and on 3 February 2005, he was convicted, fined $6,000 and placed on a good behaviour bond for three years, subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
    10 It is not necessary to identify the various powers of the Commission and the manner in which it is required to deal with complaints, pursuant to Part 4, Division 3 of the Medical Practice Act and Part 2 of the Health Care Complaints Act 1993 (NSW). Pursuant to s 51 of the Medical Practice Act, it is apparent that the Commission may either deal with the complaint made to it by referring it, for example, to the Medical Tribunal, or it may make a complaint of its own, which it can then refer to the Medical Tribunal. Which it did in the present case is of no consequence, although the third complaint which related to the conviction appears to have been a complaint made by the Commission and not by the Board. 
     
      
    11 The Commission is required to give written notice of the complaint to the practitioner: Health Care Complaints Act, ss 16 and 28. Whether that was done does not appear from the material before this Court. Rather, the complaints are identified in a notice, signed by the Director of Proceedings, Health Care Complaints Commission, advising the practitioner that “the Medical Tribunal has received a complaint from the Health Care Complaints Commission”. If, as the Court was advised, that form of notice is common practice, the practice is unfortunate. It suggests, quite wrongly, that the Commission is an agent of the Tribunal for the purpose of giving notice. The Tribunal is, and should be seen to be, a body independent of the Commission. 
     
      
    12 The first complaint alleged that the practitioner: 
     
      
       
        
        “Has been guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct within the meaning of section 36 of the [ 
        Medical Practice 
        ] Act and/or professional misconduct within the meaning of section 37 of the Act in that he has: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          demonstrated that the knowledge, skill or judgment possessed, or care exercised, by him in the practice of medicine is significantly below the standard reasonably expected of a practitioner of an equivalent level of training or experience; and/or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          engaged in improper or unethical conduct relating to the practice of medicine. 
          
         
        
       
       
       Particulars 
       
       
        
        On 26 September 2004, at Woolaware, New South Wales the practitioner possessed child pornography.” 
        
       
      
    13 The Court has recently commented on the indiscriminate use of statutory language in such complaints: see Health Care Complaints Commission v Karalasingham [2007] NSWCA 267 at [27]-[28]. As might have been expected, there was no case presented before the Tribunal to suggest that the private possession on a home computer of child pornography said anything about the knowledge, skill or judgment possessed, or care exercised by the practitioner in the practice of medicine. Rather, the case presented was that the possession of child pornography constituted improper or unethical conduct “relating to” the practice of medicine. The complaint should properly have been limited in that way. 
     
      
    14 When the Medical Tribunal came in due course to consider this complaint, it formed the view that the relevant conduct did not fall within the definition of “unsatisfactory professional conduct” in s 36 of the Medical Practice Act and therefore could not constitute professional misconduct under s 37 of the Act. The reasoning of the Tribunal in that respect was that s 36 did not deal with “a matter that is unconnected in any way with the practice of medicine”, and that the practitioner’s conduct “is not professional conduct at all”: Tribunal Reasons at [50] and [51]. Although the definition of “unsatisfactory professional conduct” included conduct that results in the practitioner being convicted of certain specified offences, the Tribunal correctly noted that the offence in question was not one of those specified in s 36(1)(d) of the Medical Practice Act: indeed no crime specified in the Crimes Act fell within that part of the definition. 
     
      
    15 It will be necessary to return to aspects of this complaint in considering the orders made, but no further consideration is necessary at this stage, because there is no appeal pursued by the Commission against the dismissal of the first complaint. 
     
      
    16 The second complaint, also based on the conduct being possession of child pornography, was that the practitioner was “not of good character”, within the meaning of that phrase in s 39(e). That complaint was also dismissed, and the Commission seeks to appeal against that order. 
     
      
    17 The third complaint was identified in the following terms in the document dated 15 December 2005: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The practitioner] has been convicted of an offence, the circumstances of which render him unfit in the public interest to practise medicine. 
        
       
       
       Particulars 
       
       
        
        On 3 February 2005 at Sutherland Local Court the practitioner was convicted of one count of possession of child pornography under section 578B(2) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900, being 66 images of boys apparently under the age of 16 years.” 
        
       
      
    18 The Medical Practice Act permits a complaint to be made that a practitioner has been convicted of an offence: s 39(a). So much was admitted. However, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the circumstances of the conviction rendered the practitioner unfit in the public interest to practise medicine and hence upheld the complaint on a limited basis only. The notice of appeal originally challenged the failure of the Tribunal to accept the third complaint, with the consequential characteristic that it rendered him unfit to practice. Although, that ground of appeal was abandoned prior to the hearing, the Commission did pursue at the hearing of the appeal a challenge based on the failure of the Tribunal to deregister the practitioner. However, there is a statutory limitation on deregistration and suspension expressed in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        64 Tribunal can suspend or deregister in certain cases 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) The Tribunal may by order suspend a person from practising medicine for a specified period or direct that a person be deregistered if the Tribunal is satisfied (when it finds on a complaint about the person): 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) that the person is not competent to practise medicine, or 
             
            (b) that the person is guilty of professional misconduct, or 
             
            (c) that the person has been convicted … and the circumstances of the offence render the person unfit in the public interest to practise medicine, or 
             
            (d) that the person is not of good character.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    19 Having abandoned its challenge to the failure to characterise the conviction as falling within the terms of s 64(1)(c), the Commission could only succeed in obtaining an order for deregistration if it made good its complaint that the practitioner was not of good character, within s 64(1)(d). (It was not suggested that paragraph (a) was engaged and no appeal was brought against the dismissal of the first complaint, which might have engaged paragraph (b).) 
     
      
    20 The remaining two challenges which arise on the appeal concern the orders made by the Tribunal. Those orders were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) that Dr Wingate’s practice be restricted in that he must not attend upon a person of less than 18 years of age without the presence of a nurse or other person approved by the Medical Board; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) that Dr Wingate continue in treatment with a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist of his choosing at a frequency determined by the therapist and for Dr Wingate to consent for the therapist to notify the Board of termination of treatment. Such treatment is to continue until it is reviewed by the Board; 
        
       
       
        
        (3) that Dr Wingate be reprimanded in respect of his downloading of pornographic images of children in the period 1998-2004; 
        
       
       
        
        (4) that Dr Wingate be reprimanded for his failure to provide the Medical Board with accurate information concerning his sexual orientation and the nature of the offences which he committed; 
        
       
       
        
        (5) that Dr Wingate pay the costs of the hearing.” 
        
       
      
    21 Although some reliance was placed upon orders (3) and (4) in relation to the challenge to the dismissal of the character complaint, they were not challenged as to their terms. The only order which was challenged, on the assumption that the dismissal of the character complaint was not disturbed, was order (1). The Commission sought a blanket prohibition on attendances upon a person of less than 18 years of age. It complained that the Tribunal denied the parties procedural fairness in failing to indicate an intention to make some other order and provide them with an opportunity to address in relation to it. Secondly, the Commission asserted error on the part of the Tribunal in apparently taking into account as a mitigating factor that the practitioner had been subjected to punishment under the criminal law. 
     
      
    Appellate jurisdiction22 The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to s 90 of the Medical Practice Act which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        90 Appeal against Tribunal’s decisions and actions 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) A person about whom a complaint is referred to the Tribunal, or the complainant, may appeal to the Supreme Court against: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) a decision of the Tribunal with respect to a point of law, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) the exercise of any power of the Tribunal under Division 4 (Disciplinary Powers of Committees and Tribunal) of Part 4.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    23 The first matter challenged on the appeal was the decision of the Tribunal to dismiss the character complaint. It was accepted that this ground might be established by demonstrating an error of law on the part of the Tribunal which materially affected its conclusion: see Prakash v Health Care Complaints Commission [2006] NSWCA 153 at [82] and Health Care Complaints Commission v Karalasingham [2007] NSWCA 267 at [11]-[19]. 
     
      
    24 With respect to the challenge to the orders made by the Tribunal, the Commission is, of course, entitled to identify an error of law in the strict sense, but it may also rely upon the broader power conferred by paragraph (b) of sub-s 90(1), which is not confined to circumstances where an error of law has been identified. However, a challenge to the orders may not extend to “question the acceptance by the Tribunal of the facts comprising proof of the complaint” those facts not being otherwise open to scrutiny: see Bannister v Walton (1993) 30 NSWLR 699 at 734C (Priestley JA) and 735A-B (Clarke JA) and see Karalasingham at [23]. Subject to that constraint, the appeal is one to which s 75A of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) applies and is by way of a rehearing. Nevertheless, because the orders involve the exercise of a discretionary power, this Court will only intervene in accordance with the well-established principles set out in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505: see Prakash [2006] NSWCA 153 at [85] and [89]; see also Karalasingham at [23]-[24]. 
     
      
    Dismissal of character complaint25 The Tribunal set out the legal principles relating to a complaint that a practitioner was “not of good character” in terms which met with no criticism in point of law from the Commission: see also Karalasingham at [45]-[54]. Rather, the error in the Tribunal’s decision was said to be disclosed by the making of orders (3) and (4). The terms of the two reprimands went, it was contended, well beyond the scope of the conviction complaint which the Tribunal upheld. Whilst that may have cast doubt upon their validity (which was not challenged by the practitioner), the Commission argued that they revealed implicit factual findings which could only have been relevant to the character complaint and were only consistent with a finding that the practitioner was not of good character. Further, when the first order, requiring a ‘chaperone’ when attending a patient of less than 18 years is taken into account, the inference is irresistible, so the Commission contended, that the Tribunal considered the practitioner not to be “a suitable repository of the trust that the public is entitled to repose in medical practitioners”. 
     
      
    26 Whilst the reasoning relied on by the Commission was kept distinct in relation to the rejection of the character complaint and the making of order (1), it is convenient to note that the challenge to order (1) included the proposition that the need to impose such a condition demonstrated a lack of faith in the practitioner’s character and future conduct which was inconsistent with his continuing entitlement to practice medicine: see Health Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield (1997) 41 NSWLR 630 at 639B-C. 
     
      
    27 In order to evaluate this challenge it is necessary to have regard to the findings of primary fact concerning the practitioner’s conduct. First, although the criminal conviction related to a reasonably small number of pornographic images, reprimand (3) reflected a finding that the practitioner had been downloading pornographic images of children for some six years between 1998 and 2004. The Tribunal found that he downloaded images “over an extended period”, starting in 1998, and involving “in excess of 10,000 images”: at [61] (5) and [87] (2). Although the number of images was an extraordinarily high figure, the actual number of occasions on which images were downloaded was more likely to be reflected by the number of sub-folders in the computer memory, which was in the order of 270: [61] (5). 
     
      
    28 The pornographic images which became the subject of the criminal charge, were, following information provided by the practitioner, located on an external hard drive of his computer. Nevertheless, the police confiscated two computers in addition to the external hard drive. It appears that, prior to his conviction, no steps were taken to view the contents of the hard disk drives in the two computers. The evidence as to when they were viewed by police was not the subject of any specific finding by the Tribunal, but it was prior to the return to the practitioner of the computers on 11 September 2005. It seems likely that they were viewed on 3 August 2005 by an Australian Federal Police officer who was invited to copy the disks before they were returned. It appears that the disks were also wiped of the offending material before they were returned. However, no steps appear to have been taken by New South Wales police to view the contents of the disk until mid-2006. In August 2006, Senior Constable Royan inspected the contents of the copied disks: Statement, 22 August 2006. 
     
      
    29 In relation to the discovery of the further images, the Tribunal commented at [55]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The late discovery of further images has not led to any further charges, but the existence of such material has significance in relation to this inquiry in a number of respects. First, it means that the offence of which Dr Wingate was convicted was not reflective of the full extent of his conduct in relation to child pornography so far as this Tribunal is concerned. Second, it is linked to a question of Dr Wingate’s conduct after he was charged with the offence.” 
        
       
      
    30 One relevant aspect of his conduct arose from the exercise by the Board of powers conferred on it under s 66 of the Medical Practice Act, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        66 Suspension or conditions to protect the public 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) The Board must, if at any time it is satisfied that such action is necessary for the purpose of protecting the life or physical or mental health of any person: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) by order suspend a registered medical practitioner from practising medicine for such period (not exceeding 8 weeks) as is specified in the order, or 
             
            (b) impose on a registered medical practitioner’s registration such conditions, relating to the practitioner’s practising medicine, as it considers appropriate. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) The Board may take such action: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) whether or not a complaint has been made or referred to the Board about the practitioner, and 
             
            (b) whether or not proceedings in respect of such a complaint are before the Tribunal or a Committee. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) The Board is to give written notice of any action taken under this section to the practitioner concerned.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    31 The Board took steps under s 66 by delegating its power to an inquiry consisting of two persons who conducted a hearing with the practitioner. As the delegates emphasised in their report of 30 November 2004, it was not their role “to determine the truth of the allegations made by the police, or to consider issues relating to Dr Wingate’s character”. Rather, their role was “to identify whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that Dr Wingate constitutes a risk to the public so as to warrant action being taken in relation to him pursuant to s 66 of the Act”: Report, p 8. 
     
      
    32 No transcript was taken of the statements made by the practitioner to the inquiry, but their effect was summarised by the delegates in their report. Based on that material, the Tribunal was satisfied that the practitioner misled the delegates in a number of respects relating to the circumstances of the offence: at [61]. That caused the Tribunal to issue a reprimand in the form of order (4). 
     
      
    33 There is no challenge to the Tribunal’s findings, but there were a number of factors relating to the information supplied to the delegates and the degree to which it was misleading, which were relevant to the course taken by the Tribunal in formulating its orders. 
     
      
    34 The first factor was that no complaint was laid in respect of the misleading statements to the delegates of the Board, although no doubt either the Board or the Commission could have laid a complaint prior to the hearing before the Tribunal. The Board’s inquiry was first conducted on 29 October 2004 whereas the hearing before the Tribunal did not commence until 20 November 2006; there had been ample time for either body to consider whether a further complaint should be laid. None was. Indeed, had it wished to deal with the matter in this manner, the Tribunal itself had power to deem an additional complaint to be before it: see Medical Practice Act, Schedule 2, cl 5. That power was not invoked. 
     
      
    35 The practitioner was cross-examined about this material without objection. However, because the three complaints already before the Tribunal were being heard together (pursuant to Schedule 2, cl 5(1) of the Act) including a general charge of possessing child pornography on 26 September 2004, (pursuant to complaint 1) and not being of good character (pursuant to complaint 2) an objection might have been hard to justify. In any event, it is not the practitioner’s challenge which brings this material to the fore, but rather the Commission’s appeal. The fact that the delegates of the Board considered the broad-ranging discussion in relation to the practitioner’s sexuality and possession of pornographic material to be relevant at a time when there had been no conviction, does not mean that the material is not also relevant to the orders to be made even though the only complaint upheld by the Tribunal related to the conviction. 
     
      
    36 The second factor was the absence of any transcript of the hearing before the Board’s delegates. Thus the relevant summary in the report of the inquiry was headed “Alleged Criminal Activity”. It commenced with the statement: 
     
      
       
        
        “The delegates questioned Dr Wingate in relation to the alleged crime of possessing illegal child pornographic material.” 
        
       
      
     It is not clear to what extent the delegates questioned him in relation to matters going beyond the subject matter of the charge. 
     
      
    37 Given that the material downloaded extended well beyond that which was the subject of the single criminal charge, care should no doubt have been taken by the fact-finder in assessing the degree to which the practitioner misled the delegates. However, this was a matter which was explored in cross-examination with him and was no doubt taken into account by the Tribunal. For example, the practitioner was asked why he had told the delegates that he had accessed only one site. He replied (Tcpt, 21/11/06, p 100): 
     
      
       
        
        “Because I understood incorrectly but I understood that they wanted to know what my criminal activity was. … At that time in October 2004 what I understood the Board to be concerned with was the criminal offences, or the criminal offence, for which I was being prosecuted and for which I was subsequently convicted, which was the possession of 66 images. That is why that interview and subsequently I referred to that and not to the greater corpus of images that you’ve been referring to during this interview.” 
        
       
      
    38 A third factor which was addressed in this context, was the extent to which the practitioner could properly be criticised for not volunteering to the Board the commission of further criminal activity with which he had not been charged. Before addressing that matter, it is convenient to note the findings made by the Tribunal. 
     
      
       
        
        “61. Dr Wingate misled the delegates of the Section 66 Inquiry in a number of respects relevant to the circumstances of the offence: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) whilst admitting his homosexual interest he implied that he still saw himself as bisexual, and more importantly said nothing about his hebephilic interest; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) he said that he had downloaded the offending images ‘out of curiosity’; he admitted to this Tribunal that in fact he downloaded the images as a means of sexual arousal; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) he denied that he was sexually excited by images of children but did not admit that he was sexually aroused by images of ‘children’ as defined by s 578B ie under 16 years of age; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (4) his statement that the images involved post-pubescent children was not true – there were photos of pubescent and pre-pubescent children; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (5) he had not downloaded images from one site over a short period – his downloading started in 1998 and continued until the time of his arrest … ; there was evidence that he had approximately 270 sub-folders; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (6) he said that he used the internet to look for images of young men when, as we have noted, his interest included males less than 16 years of age; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (7) he described the images as involving children doing child-like things. This was a misleading description of the images on the hard drive … .” 
          
         
        
       
      
    39 This summary of the respects in which the practitioner had misled the Board drew attention to two related distinctions which the Tribunal had identified in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “57. The term ‘paedophilia’ is used by the medical profession to indicate sexual interest in children who do not have secondary sexual characteristics, ie who are pre-pubescent … . That condition is a recognised psychiatric disorder in the DSM-IV categorisation. The term ‘hebephilic’ describes a sexual interest in pubescent and post-pubescent young males and females. Hebephilia is not categorised as a psychiatric condition but a psychologist may describe the interest (provided it is acted upon) as a dysfunctional disorder … . … The legislation relating to ‘child pornography’ in this state does not focus only on pre-pubescent children but rather focuses on children who are or appear to be less than 16 years of age. It follows that a person with a hebephilic interest who downloads pictures of children apparently less than 16 years of age is not a paedophile in the technical sense of the word, yet is engaging in conduct that its prohibited in this state. A person with a hebephilic interest may also have a paedophilic interest … .” 
        
       
      
    40 If the issue had arisen as to whether, on a complaint of criminal activity based upon a conviction alone, the Tribunal would be entitled to fashion its orders by reference to other criminal activity which did not fall within the scope of the conviction, a number of issues would have arisen, which do not arise in the present case, because neither party challenges the orders on that basis. Nor is there any doubt that the Tribunal made factual findings which would support the scope of those orders. In other words, the Tribunal was clearly satisfied that the practitioner did download pornographic images of children in the period 1998-2004 and that he failed to provide the Board (through its delegates) with accurate information concerning his sexual orientation and the nature of offences which he had committed. In these circumstances, there can only be a relevant inconsistency between the orders made and the rejection of the character complaint if the findings of fact on which the orders were based reasonably led to only one conclusion, namely that the practitioner was not of good character. 
     
      
    41 It could not be said, for example, that the Tribunal did not take these matters into account in addressing the complaint relating to character. It expressly did so, stating: 
     
      
       
        
        “84. The Tribunal in forming a view as to Dr Wingate’s character is entitled to consider the facts of the offences and the wider circumstances not forming part of the offences with which he was charged and to which he pleaded guilty in addition to the other matters relevant to character. 
        
       
       
        
        85. Another matter to which we have had regard is the failure of Dr Wingate to honestly describe to the delegates and Dr Allnutt [a psychiatrist to whom he was referred by the Board] the nature of his offending, and his failure to honestly describe his sexual proclivities, as reflecting adversely upon him.” 
        
       
      
    42 There were further inferences drawn by the Tribunal for the purpose of formulating orders (3) and (4) and in particular the reprimand with respect to the failure to provide accurate information to the Board. In that regard, the Tribunal made two additional findings: 
     
      
       
        
        “90. Looking at the lack of truthfulness, this was clearly motivated by a desire to minimise his conduct in the eyes of the Medical Board, its delegates and this Tribunal, but in our view that motive does not excuse his conduct. … 
         
        … 
         
        93. We think that his failure to provide a frank account of his proclivities and the nature of his offending is a matter of concern for which he ought also be reprimanded. We are anxious to ensure that practitioners who have transgressed understand that failure to provide honest and frank accounts of matters relevant to the manner in which the Board deals with them may well impact upon an assessment of their character, quite apart from the Tribunal’s views of the original offending.” 
        
       
      
    43 At a general level, these comments may be said to reflect the duty of full and frank disclosure of misconduct which applies both to members and applicants for membership of professions such as law and medicine. However, the scope of this obligation requires more detailed attention as to its application in particular circumstances. One well-known example is the case of In re Davis (1947) 75 CLR 409, involving an applicant for admission as a barrister who many years before, as a young man, had been convicted of house-breaking for the purpose of theft. His application was refused at least in part upon the basis that he had failed to disclose the conviction to the Barristers Admission Board. Dixon J, after noting the difficulty of establishing good character in the light of such a crime, stated at p 426: 
     
      
       
        
        “But a prerequisite, in any case, would be a complete realization by the party concerned of his obligation of candour to the court in which he desired to serve as an agent of justice. The fulfilment of that obligation of candour with its attendant risks proved too painful for the appellant, and when he applied to the Board for his certificate he withheld the fact that he had been convicted.” 
        
       
      
    44 A further well-known example of the obligation may be found in Re Veron; Ex parte Law Society of New South Wales (1966) 84 WN(NSW) (Part 1) 136 at 141 where the Court (Heron CJ, Sugerman and McLelland JJA), after noting that the solicitor had not filed an affidavit or offered to give oral evidence, described the course as “irregular” and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “The respondent is an officer of the court. The Full Court of the Supreme Court held in November 1965 that on the material presented to it by the Law Society a prima facie case of misconduct was made out and called upon the respondent to show cause why he should not be dealt with. The matter arises within the disciplinary jurisdiction of the Court and if the respondent after consideration declines to give his account on oath of the matters charged he cannot complain if the Court holds against him that the facts as deposed to … are substantially true. … The jurisdiction is a special one and it is not open to the respondent when called upon to show cause, as an officer of the Court, to lie by and to engage in a battle of tactics, as was the case here, and to endeavour to meet the charges by mere argument.” 
        
       
      
    45 It may be noted that neither of these examples involves any suggestion that the obligation of candour overrides the general law privilege against self-incrimination. Absent an express statutory provision, or a necessary implication arising from statute, to that effect, the privilege will generally be available. On the other hand, the privilege does not entitle a practitioner to make untruthful or misleading statements nor, if the practitioner declines to answer particular questions, will it prevent the Board or a tribunal taking steps in order to protect a relevant public interest. 
     
      
    46 In Police Service Board v Morris (1985) 156 CLR 397 at 403, Gibbs CJ accepted that the privilege might apply in relation to a penalty imposed in disciplinary proceedings against a police officer. In Bowen-James v Walton (NSWCA, 5 August 1991, unrep) (Samuels, Meagher and Handley JJA) Morris was distinguished on the basis that the power to discipline a medical practitioner was entirely protective. Their Honours noted that Parliament had expressly provided in the Medical Practitioners Act 1938 (NSW) that disciplinary proceedings might be pursued despite the existence of uncompleted criminal proceedings: see Edelsten v Richmond (1987) 11 NSWLR 51. However, in Edelsten the conflict of interests created in that situation had not lead the Court to conclude that the privilege against self-incrimination was overridden. As noted by Hope JA (Clarke JA agreeing) at 61D: 
     
      
       
        
        “The discretion given to the Tribunal involves a balancing of the public interest in the investigation of the complaint with the public interest in the observance of the right to silence. This involves, among other things, a consideration of the nature and gravity of the complaint and of the criminal charge, and of the circumstance that while the medical practitioner cannot be required to give a self-incriminating answer, he may be embarrassed in his defence to the complaint if he does not do so, and, if he does give evidence, he may be prejudiced in relation to the criminal proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    (Priestley JA made a similar point at p 65F-G.) 
     
      
    47 In Bowen-James, after referring to passages in Edelsten and passages to similar effect in Ibrahim v Walton (NSWCA, 23 April 1991, unrep) (Hope AJA, Samuels and Priestley JJA agreeing), the Court continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “In our opinion there is no right to silence or any privilege against self-incrimination upon which a medical practitioner, answering a complaint before the Tribunal, is entitled to rely. Indeed, we would endorse the observations made by Hope AJA in  
        Ibrahim 
        . There is a public interest in the proper discharge by medical practitioners of the privileges which the community accords to them, and in the due accounting for the exercise of the influence which the nature of the occupation permits them, and indeed requires them, to exert over their patients. They are not, of course, officers of the Supreme Court and, accordingly, the precise force of the decision in  
        In Re Veron; Ex parte Law Society of New South Wales 
         (1966) 84 WN(NSW) (Pt 1) 136, particularly of what was said at 141-2, cannot apply. Nevertheless, we are of the opinion that if a medical practitioner fails to answer by giving his or her account of the matters charged, there can be no complaint if the Tribunal draws the unfavourable evidentiary inference which absence from the witness box commonly attracts.” 
        
       
      
    48 To the extent that there was an attempt to distinguish Morris from disciplinary cases involving the protective jurisdiction of the Court, the comments in Bowen-James may need to be followed with caution in the light of Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2004) 220 CLR 129 at [28]-[32] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ). Further, although the Court in Bowen-James spoke in terms of there being no applicable privilege against self-incrimination, that was not the approach adopted in Edelsten, set out above, nor in Veron. 
     
      
    49 The issue in Bowen-James involved an objection by the practitioner to an order that he file a statement of his evidence in response to the complainant’s evidence. His challenge to the order was rejected. However, what approach would be adopted today in that regard might need to be considered in the light of the recent decision in MacDonald v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] NSWCA 304, dealing with a question as to whether a person subject to civil penalty proceedings brought by ASIC could be required to file a defence. 
     
      
    50 A point raised in the course of this appeal was that the Medical Practice Act did not appear to provide for any hearing prior to an exercise of powers by the Board under s 66. It would follow that the delegates could not, on any view, have compelled the practitioner to answer their questions: he must have done so voluntarily and not on oath. The Court’s attention was not directed to any statutory provision which would have overridden, either expressly or by necessary implication, his privilege against self-incrimination. Accordingly, it must at least be doubted whether a professional obligation of full and frank disclosure extended to the process instituted by the Board. The Tribunal was no doubt correct to say that neither the pending criminal proceedings nor the possibility of disciplinary proceedings conferred any licence to make false or misleading statements. However, there is a distinction to be drawn between misleading statements and a refusal to answer questions or to expand on answers already given. In this respect, it is arguable that the Tribunal adopted criticisms which went beyond those reasonably available in the circumstances. However, the matter need not be taken further because there is no challenge to the scope of the reprimand, nor the findings upon which it was based. So far as the challenge to the dismissal of the second complaint was concerned, the Commission was content to rely on the adverse findings made by the Tribunal. 
     
      
    51 That being so, and the Tribunal having otherwise considered and expressly applied correct principles, one is left with a decision in relation to the character complaint which cannot be challenged in point of law, unless it can be said that only one conclusion was reasonably open on the facts as found. There are clearly two views open, but that is not good enough for the Commission and it does not contend that the view taken by the Tribunal was not reasonably open. The challenge to the rejection of the character complaint as being erroneous in point of law, based upon inconsistency with orders (3) and (4), has not been made out. 
     
      
    Taking into account the criminal penalty52 The second issue raised by the Commission on the appeal derives from the following statement by the Tribunal in the course of considering what orders should be made: 
     
      
       
        
        “92. We think his conduct in committing the offence of possessing child pornography is a serious matter. Dr Wingate has been dealt with by the criminal law, but we believe this Tribunal should recognise the seriousness of the offence by reprimanding him for that conduct and for downloading the many other images of similar content with which he was not charged.” 
        
       
      
    53 The specific complaint concerns the express recognition given to the penalty imposed by the Local Court for the offence in mitigation, it is contended, of an order having any further punitive effect. The criminal penalty imposed contained two limbs. The first was a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of three years pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) which provided for such an order “[i]nstead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender”. A specific condition was included in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “To accept the supervision and guidance of the New South Wales Probation Service for such of the period as that Service deems sufficient, obey all reasonable directions for counselling, educational development or drug and alcohol rehabilitation and report to the Sutherland Probation Service within 7 days.” 
        
       
      
    In addition, a fine of $6,000 was imposed. 
     
      
    54 There are a number of difficulties with this ground of challenge. First, it cannot be said as a matter of general principle that a professional disciplinary tribunal should disregard any penalty imposed under the criminal law. Thus, where the penalty imposed under the criminal law is a period of imprisonment, there may be an incongruity between the status of the practitioner as a prisoner and his or her continued right to practise: see Ziems v The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court (NSW) (1957) 97 CLR 279 at 290 (Fullagar J). Further and more specifically, although no power is conferred on the Tribunal to impose a fine unless it is satisfied that there has been unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct, even in those cases a fine is not to be imposed if another court has imposed a fine or other penalty: Medical Practice Act, s 62(2).  
     
      
    55 Although the exercise of professional disciplinary powers may be seen as protective and not as involving punishment (see Ziems at 286 (Dixon CJ) and at 289 (Fullagar J, quoting Jordan CJ) there is undoubtedly a degree of overlap between the purposes served by each in their respective contexts. That a fine will have a punitive effect, whether imposed by a criminal court or a disciplinary tribunal, is expressly recognised in s 62(2). The fact that disciplinary orders are commonly characterised as “protective” does not deny that they have punitive effects, nor does it require that the fact of criminal punishment must be disregarded: compare Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2004) 220 CLR 129 at [30]-[32]. In particular circumstances, it may be important to recognise that disciplinary orders other than fines also have punitive effects and to take those effects into account in ensuring that the necessary protective purpose is achieved without unnecessarily imposing a degree of punishment exceeding that thought appropriate by the criminal court.  
     
      
    56 Finally, the challenge should be rejected because it is clear that the Tribunal did not refer to the criminal punishment inappropriately. Although the Tribunal might in appropriate circumstances have sought to mould its orders so that, when taken with the criminal punishment, they did not have a disproportionate punitive effect, that is not what it did. Rather, having acknowledged the criminal punishment, it held that a further recognition of the seriousness of the conduct, by an order of the Tribunal, was necessary. This challenge must be rejected. 
     
      
    Failure to foreshadow order57 The third matter of challenge is that, before imposing a so-called ‘chaperone condition’ as a qualification to order (1), the Tribunal ought to have sought submissions from the parties as to the propriety of such an order. The formulation of such a ground in terms of procedural unfairness is curious. It was not necessary for the Commission to establish an error of this kind to engage the powers of this Court to vary the order made by the Tribunal. As will be seen below, the matters which should have been addressed by the Tribunal in this context and may not have been were all raised in the course of the hearing before it. The substantive issues were of importance and were raised in both written submissions and oral argument before this Court and must be addressed. 
     
      
    58 Turning first to the question of procedural unfairness, to suggest that such a condition could not reasonably have been in the contemplation of the Commission at the time it addressed the Tribunal defies reality. First, the delegates of the Board imposed a chaperone condition in exercising powers under s 66 of the Medical Practice Act. Secondly, as the Commission acknowledged, the Tribunal invited the parties to consider a condition that the practitioner “not be permitted to see patients under 18 years of age”: Reasons, [94]. If there had otherwise been any doubt about the matter, it was clear then that the Commission was considering orders other than suspension or deregistration. Thirdly, counsel appearing for the Commission before the Tribunal questioned Dr Baron (a clinical psychologist) as to the need for a chaperone (Tcpt, 22/11/06, pp 221-222) on the second last day of the hearing. Accordingly, this ground of appeal must be rejected. 
     
      
    59 The claim of procedural unfairness may also be tested by inquiring what submission the Commission would have made had it been offered the opportunity. The submission would have been that, despite the apparent inconsistency with the concession in relation to an unqualified prohibition, the chaperone condition made the order inconsistent with Litchfield. Additionally, it seems that there might also have been some further consideration of the operation of the statutory prohibitions on employment, as there was in this Court. 
     
      
    60 The strength or otherwise of the Commission’s position in relation to order (1) must turn on the appropriateness of the order, rather than the absence of discussion of these matters before the Tribunal. The concern which the Tribunal expressed to the parties was that a prohibition on seeing young patients might be inconsistent with the principles identified in Health Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield (1997) 41 NSWLR 630 (Gleeson CJ, Meagher and Handley JJA). Litchfield involved inappropriate sexual contact with female patients; as the Court noted at p 638D: 
     
      
       
        
        “Female patients entrust themselves to doctors, male and female, for medical examinations and treatment which may require intimate physical contact which they would not otherwise accept from the doctor. The standards of the profession oblige doctors to use the opportunities afforded them for such contact for proper therapeutic purposes and not otherwise.” 
        
       
      
    61 In those circumstances, the Court considered that a general condition requiring the practitioner to have a chaperone present whenever seeing a female patient indicated a conclusion that he could not be trusted in relation to a fundamental aspect of proper professional conduct. It concluded that the Tribunal should properly have removed his name from the register, a course which the Court itself then took in exercise of powers conferred by s 91 of the Medical Practice Act. In reaching that conclusion, it rejected a submission for the practitioner that the Tribunal, in imposing the condition, should have been understood as finding that the doctor was not likely to reoffend. 
     
      
    62 In relation to Litchfield, care must be taken, as the Commission recognised in its written submissions, in deriving a principle of over-general application from the circumstances of a particular case. It might be argued from Litchfield that a condition should only be imposed to provide necessary protection to the patients of a practitioner, but that if such a condition is reasonably necessary, the practitioner must lack a precondition to entitlement to continued practice and accordingly the need to impose the condition demonstrates unfitness to practice. Clearly that reasoning is, when stated at that level of generality, fallacious. Conditions may be imposed in varying circumstances and for various purposes. The circumstances and purposes will always be important, in part because of the need for the Tribunal to be satisfied that the condition will be effective. In the present case, the practitioner had committed no misconduct of a ‘hands-on’ kind; there had been no inappropriate conduct of a sexual kind with any patient or indeed with any non-patient. 
     
      
    63 Whether private viewing of pornographic material involving persons under 16 years of age gave rise to a risk of any form of inappropriate conduct with patients was a matter about which the Tribunal received evidence from a psychologist and a psychiatrist. The Tribunal referred to the evidence of Dr Baron (a clinical psychologist) and Dr Allnutt (a psychiatrist) in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “83. Dr Baron did hold to his view that Dr Wingate was not a risk to his child patients but he did indicate that the revelations which had been made during the hearing would prompt him to want to examine a number of matters further if he were to engage in therapeutic treatment. Dr Allnutt and Dr Baron were of the view that caution was required in making any assessment of the likelihood of Dr Wingate committing hands-on offences.” 
        
       
      
    Further, the Tribunal noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “88. … The offence and the extent of downloading over a long period of time was serious, and the motive was sexual gratification. 
        
       
       
        
        89. We think however, that Dr Wingate appreciates the seriousness of his conduct, and as we have said, is unlikely to repeat the offence. We also accept the evidence of Dr Allnutt and Dr Baron that he is unlikely to commit a hands-on offence in the context of his medical practice, although the risk of this will be reduced even further by maintaining the steps to which we shall refer below.” 
        
       
      
    The Tribunal continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “94. We are of the view that the restrictions imposed by the court in which sentence was passed should be maintained to ensure that the very small risk of any reoffending is reduced even further as a protection to the public, and that the Dr Wingate be required to continue with treatment in relation to his hebephilia.” 
        
       
      
    64 There was no specific consideration of whether there should be a total prohibition on seeing patients under 18 years of age (as to which the Tribunal had invited submissions) or whether the prohibition could be qualified in the form permitted by order (1) (with the chaperone condition). 
     
      
    65 A number of points were relevant to the approach adopted by the Tribunal in relation to this order. First, the practitioner’s professional work was as an ophthalmologist. He had a particular speciality in macular degeneration and neuro-ophthalmology, as a result of which almost all his patients were adults and many were “elderly”: Reasons at [76]. He has practised both in Sydney and in Mudgee and has assisted once a month in a pro-bono scheme providing medical services to Aboriginal patients in the Dubbo area. Secondly, the question of reoffending needed to be considered separately from the question of inappropriate conduct towards patients, which had not occurred. Thirdly, there was an express finding as to the low risk of inappropriate conduct towards patients. Finally, during submissions on the last day of the hearing the Deputy Chairperson expressly raised with counsel for the practitioner, after there had been some discussion of the effect of statutory constraints on employment: 
     
      
       
        
        “If that’s right, then there’s no – in a way it cuts both ways, doesn’t it? It means that if we were not to deregister him but to impose a condition, it would be a condition that in effect is already in place?” 
        
       
      
    66 The purpose of imposing a condition in circumstances such as these, requires analysis. Thus, the lower the risk of inappropriate conduct in a professional setting, the greater the likelihood that a condition is being imposed for purposes other than actually preventing such misconduct. One legitimate purpose is maintenance of confidence of the public, both in the particular doctor and in the profession generally. As Dr Baron was at pains to point out in the course of his evidence, he might have a high degree of confidence in sending a six year old son to see the practitioner, but that confidence might not be shared by other members of the public who did not have his knowledge of the nature of the risk or the character of the practitioner. Relevant public concerns may thus justify the imposition of a condition where the risk is thought to be minimal. 
     
      
    67 Public concerns as to the safety of young patients may be reasonable or irrational. They may be reasonable in the sense that possession of pornographic material may, for a group of people having particular characteristics, correlate with hands-on offences. The concerns may also be reasonable in that the offence of which the practitioner was convicted potentially covers both young (pre-pubescent) children and pubescent or post-pubescent teenagers. An indication of a true paedophilic interest might be treated more seriously than a hebephilic interest, but the public who knew of the conviction would have no way of knowing which was involved. On the other hand, there may be views held by members of the public concerning the risks in such circumstances, which views have no basis in the scientific or medical literature. The Tribunal may well need to exercise caution in imposing conditions on a practitioner designed to meet views which are truly irrational prejudices. It might have little or no inhibition in imposing a condition which flowed from a rational concern, even though based on ignorance of the particular circumstances. 
     
      
    68 Other factors might also be taken into account by the Tribunal. These would include the nature of the practitioner’s practice and the circumstances in which he or she sees patients. To take an example remote from the present facts, it may be normal practice for dentists to have an assistant in the surgery whilst treating patients. In such circumstances the imposition of a condition requiring the presence of a third person might be seen as a minor variation from usual practice. Returning to the present case, Dr Baron gave the following evidence (Tcpt, 22/11/06, p 222): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Doctor, don’t you see that a need to have someone chaperon[e] juveniles whilst they’re in treatment with Dr Wingate as a problem? In itself. 
         
        A. My answer to that is no because my understanding is that it’s best professional practice across the board now with most practitioners.” 
        
       
      
    69 An assessment of the reason for imposing the condition in the present case must also take into account the fact that the delegates of the Board had imposed a condition in similar terms on 30 November 2004. Although the Tribunal did not follow the terms of that condition, it is convenient to set it out in full: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) That whenever Dr Wingate examines, treats or interviews any child under the age of 16 years of age (‘the patient’), an adult third person must be present at all times and such person may be a family member of the patient. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) That Dr Wingate send to the Board (within seven days of these orders) for its approval, a list of possible chaperones except in the circumstances where the chaperone is a family member of the patient. Any chaperone who is not included in this list must be notified to the Board and approved by the Board prior to undertaking that role. The chaperone must not be a relative of Dr Wingate. Any approval must be in accordance with the Board’s protocol concerning chaperones. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) That if in the event of a medical emergency it is not practical to obtain the services of a chaperone, a chaperone is not required, however, any such event must be notified to the Board and recorded in the list of patients referred to [below]. A medical emergency is an event where it is not possible or reasonable to have a patient with a serious or life-threatening or urgent condition, seen by another medical practitioner or transferred to the nearest hospital.” 
        
       
      
    70 Further conditions required that the practitioner forward to the Board a list of all patients under the age of 16 years, on a monthly basis. The report was to include a contemporaneous signature of the chaperone. (The condition as set out above did not include a sub-paragraph (b).) 
     
      
    71 A further factor relevant to the condition imposed on the practitioner’s practice involves the operation of legislative controls on employment of persons convicted of child pornography offences. These controls were originally enacted in the Child Protection (Prohibited Employment) Act 1998 (NSW) (“the Prohibited Employment Act”) but are now contained in the Commission for Children and Young People Act 1998 (NSW) as amended by Act No. 108 of 2005, the relevant provisions of which commenced on 2 January 2007. Under the Prohibited Employment Act, an offence under s 578B of the Crimes Act as then in force was defined as a “serious sex offence” with the result that the practitioner became a “prohibited person” upon conviction, pursuant to s 5. It was accepted for the purposes of argument, that the practitioner was and remained a “prohibited person” for the purposes of Part 7 of the Commission for Children and Young People Act, following the 2005 amendments: see now ss 33(1) and 33B. The effect is that the practitioner is prohibited, pursuant to s 33C, from undertaking “child-related employment”. The term “employment” is given a wide meaning, including “performance of work as a self-employed person” and performance of work “as a volunteer for an organisation”: see s 33(1). The phrase “child-related employment” is also defined and includes employment in “wards of public or private hospitals in which children are patients” and “employment involving the direct provision of child health services”. The phrase “child health services” is not defined and there may be some argument as to whether it covers each occasion on which a self-employed practitioner provides health services to a child. These prohibitions, contained in Division 2 of Part 7 will not apply if the Commission for Children and Young People or another tribunal (being the Industrial Relations Commission or the Administrative Decisions Tribunal) declares that they do not apply: ss 33H, 33I and 33J. 
     
      
    72 It is not necessary to determine for present purposes whether the practitioner would, subject to the operation of any declaration of non-application, commit an offence if and whenever he provides health services to a person under 18 years of age. Rather, it is sufficient to note the scope and purpose of the legislation and its application to persons who have committed an offence in a class which includes that committed by the practitioner. This inquiry leads to two conclusions. First, there is a statutory presumption that a prohibited person “poses a risk to the safety of children”: see ss 33H(7), 33J(1) and (2). Secondly, although not all forms of employment which may involve or affect children are covered by the definition of “child-related employment” it appears that very many forms of work which involve the provision of personal services to children, whether in an institutional setting or otherwise, are covered. Accordingly, there is presumed to be a relationship between conduct constituting an offence of a relevant kind and the provision of professional services in health, education, transport, child protection, recreation and “other support services”. 
     
      
    73 Although the Tribunal was not required to determine whether the statutory scheme prohibited the practitioner from supplying health services to patients under 18 years of age, it should have treated the legislative scheme as part of the legal background against which the exercise of its discretion in making orders was to be considered. It should have considered whether it was satisfied that provision of services to young patients “posed no risk” to them and, if not so satisfied, there should have been a reasoned justification for not imposing a condition which had the same effect as the statutory prohibition, if it operated. Early in its reasons, the Tribunal noted the conviction and two “legislative consequences of significance arising out of his conviction”: Reasons at [15]. The Tribunal continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first is that as a result of conviction for the offence, Dr Wingate was required to become registered on the Child Protection Register for a period of eight years. The second is that the offence under s 578B is one the conviction for which rendered Dr Wingate a ‘prohibited person’ within the meaning of the relevant legislation, which has the effect that he is not permitted to be employed or even apply for employment (and employment includes performance of work as a self-employed person: see s 3) in a position involving the direct provision of child health services or employment in the wards of public or private hospitals in which children are patients.” 
        
       
      
    74 One consequence which might have followed from that understanding was that the conduct resulting in the conviction should have been treated as improper conduct “relating to” the practice of medicine, so as to constitute unsatisfactory professional conduct within s 36(1)(m) of the Medical Practice Act. That might have resulted in the first complaint being upheld. However, there was no appeal in relation to the rejection of the first complaint because, as explained by senior counsel for the Commission, the case had not been run on that basis before the Tribunal. 
     
      
    75 When the Tribunal came to consider its orders, and noted the invitation to counsel to consider a condition “that he not be permitted to see patients under 18 years of age” the Tribunal summarised the response it received in the following terms at [94]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was agreed by both parties that such a condition would not infringe  
        Litchfield 
        , particularly given that a very similar regime is already in place by reason of the  
        Child Protection (Prohibited Employment) Act  
        1998, and now the  
        Commission for Children and Young People Act  
        1998.” 
        
       
      
    76 Having adopted that approach, the appropriate course was to impose such a condition, absent some justification for not doing so. No justification was given by the Tribunal, nor was any proffered on the appeal for the practitioner, who rather accepted that the legislation made it “inevitable that such a condition would apply, whether or not the Tribunal imposed it”: written submissions, par 11. The submissions further noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “The imposition of the chaperone condition merely reinforced the operation of s 33C of the  
        Commission for Children and Young People Act 
        . On one view it was redundant.” 
        
       
      
    77 The “chaperone condition” did not reinforce the statutory prohibition: rather it assumed that the statutory prohibition did not operate. Nor would the prohibition have been redundant: as the Commission pointed out, the statutory prohibition could be lifted by the Commission or a tribunal, without any requirement that the Commission or the Board be informed of the application. Further, as with the reprimand, it would have demonstrated a concern specifically reflecting appropriate medical professional standards. 
     
      
    78 The Tribunal was, in the circumstances, in error in making the prohibition conditional. Order (1) should be varied so that it reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Impose on the practitioner’s registration a condition that he not attend, treat or perform operations on patients under 18 years of age.” 
        
       
      
    Conclusions79 Subject to the variation of order (1), the appeal should be dismissed. Although the practitioner sought to uphold order (1) in its present form, he (and the Commission) agreed that it might be varied so as to permit a more refined operation, of the kind imposed by the Board. Given the practitioner’s position in relation to the statutory prohibition, as set out in his written submissions, it would seem that maintenance of order (1) as made by the Tribunal was not a matter of great practical significance and it was not a matter to which his counsel devoted significant time in the course of the appeal. Accordingly, the Commission having been substantially unsuccessful in the appeal, it should pay the practitioner’s costs in the Court. 
     
      
    80 Accordingly, I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Vary order (1) made by the Tribunal on 5 April 2007 so that it now reads: 
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) Impose on the practitioner’s registration a condition that he not attend, treat or perform operations on patients under 18 years of age. 
          
         
        
       
       
      (2) Otherwise dismiss the appeal. 
       
       
      (3) Order the Appellant to pay the Respondent’s costs of the appeal. 
       
      
    81 HARRISON J: I agree with Basten JA.

    4 PRICE J: On 19 March 2007 Paul Enzo Baldini pleaded guilty in the Sydney District Court to an indictment which contained three counts of being an accessory after the fact to a serious indictable offence. The charges were brought under s 347 of the Crimes Act 1900. Pursuant to s 350 of the Crimes Act an accessory after the fact to any other serious indictable offence [other than murder] is liable to imprisonment for 5 years. The offences to which the applicant was an accessory were offences contrary to s 176A of the Crimes Act, namely a director of any body corporate or public company cheating or defrauding. Offences contrary to s 176A are punishable by imprisonment of up to 10 years and are for the purposes of s 350 a serious indictable offence. 
     
      
    5 The applicant asked that two offences contained on a Form 1 be taken into account on sentence. They were also offences contrary to ss 347 and 176A of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    6 Pleas of guilty had been entered on 19 September 2006 in the Local Court by the applicant to five counts of being an accessory after the fact to a serious indictable offence and it seems that for administrative reasons when the indictment was presented in the District Court two counts were included on the Form 1. 
     
      
    7 On 29 March 2009 the applicant was sentenced to an aggregate non-parole period of two years with a balance of term of six months structured as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: Imprisonment for a non-parole period of twelve months commencing on 29 March 2007 and expiring on 28 March 2008 with a balance of term of four months commencing on 29 March 2008 and expiring on 29 July 2008. 
       
       
      Count 2: Fixed term of imprisonment for twelve months commencing on 28 March 2008; and  
       
       
      Count 3: Imprisonment for a non-parole period of eighteen months commencing on 28 September 2007 and expiring on 27 March 2008 (sic) with a balance of term of six months expiring on 28 September 2009 (sic). The earliest date that the applicant is eligible for release on parole was specified to be 27 March 2009. 
       
      
    8 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed.  
     
      
    9 Alfred Gomes and Jose Gomes (the Gomes brothers) were sentenced at the same sentencing proceedings as the applicant. They were the directors who had committed the serious indictable offences contrary to s 176A of the Crimes Act. Samuel Bikhit was also sentenced at the same proceedings as the applicant. He was a director of Egypco Chemical Australia Pty Limited an existing customer of Smartpak.  
     
      
    10 The Gomes brothers were the directors of Smartpak Australia Pty Ltd (Smartpak) which had entered into a factoring agreement with Scottish Pacific Finance Pty Ltd (Scottish Pacific). 
     
      
    11 Scottish Pacific purchased invoices rendered by Smartpak to its customers at a price which was less than the face value of the invoices. Shortly after receiving the invoices, Scottish Pacific paid a percentage to Smartpak known as “the advance”. Scottish Pacific then recovered the balance from the customer, which it then forwarded minus a “factoring fee” to Smartpak. The factoring agreement assisted Smartpak to conduct its business of supplying paper products by ensuring that it had a continuous cash flow. 
     
      
    12 The Gomes brothers devised a means of raising false invoices which they sent to Scottish Pacific. They created false invoices in the names of existing known customers of Smartpak in respect of which neither a product order had been received nor product supplied. These false invoices were forwarded to Scottish Pacific who paid the advance to Smartpak. Scottish Pacific then sought to recover the balance from the customer. There were existing customers of Smartpak who participated in the arrangement and paid, at the request of Smartpak, the amounts owing to Scottish Pacific on the invoices which they knew to be false. Smartpak provided the existing customers with the funds to do this.  
     
      
    13 The applicant was a director and controller of State Packaging Pty Ltd (State) which was an existing customer of Smartpak. He participated in five transactions to produce false invoices in the name of State for factoring with Scottish Pacific and acknowledged the false invoices by accepting the monthly statements in which the fraudulent invoices appeared. 
     
      
    14 Count 1 involved the factoring of three invoices totalling $116,639.60 between 6 January 2003 and 21 January 2003. Count 2 involved the factoring of five invoices totalling $127,084.43 between 3 February 2003 and 13 February 2003, count 3 involved the factoring of three invoices totalling $100,682.88 between 1 May 2003 and 27 May 2003. The first offence on the Form 1 involved three invoices totalling $79,424.40 and the second offence three invoices totalling $119,958.19. The total value of the false invoices which involve the applicant amounted to $540,789.50. 
     
      
    15 Scottish Pacific in relation to each of these transactions was paid in full by State utilising monies paid to it by either Smartpak or other companies controlled by the Gomes brothers.  
     
      
    16 The first ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offences. The second ground is that his Honour erred in finding aggravating factors established against the appellant. These grounds are related and may be considered together. 
     
      
    17 The principle contention is that the Judge erred in rejecting the submission made on behalf of the applicant that his involvement did not cause Scottish Pacific to suffer any loss. During his remarks on sentence the Judge said (ROS at 20): 
     
      
       
        
        “The exception mentioned above was the submission put on behalf of Mr Baldini that his involvement in the offences did not cause Scottish to suffer any loss and that any loss which might have been sustained by Scottish would have been confined to the investigation of the matter and the costs associated with the liquidation. When asked to reconcile this submission with the agreed fact that Scottish had incurred a loss of $1,300,000.00 the explanation offered was in these terms  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The loss is agreed but not due to the transaction the subject of the charges.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        These submissions on behalf of the all of the accused are not sustainable in light of contested evidence in the case. The agreed facts in the case of Mr Baldini and Mr Bikhit expressly state that there was such a loss and it was attributable to the actions of those offenders.” 
        
       
      
      
     
      
    18 The statement of agreed facts contained a statement that Scottish Pacific had suffered a loss of $1.3 million. It seems that his Honour misconstrued counsel for the applicant’s enunciation during the sentencing hearing that there was no dispute as to any of the facts (POS T 42 L 19-20 19/3/07) as an acceptance that the applicant was to be held liable for the loss referred to in the agreed facts. 
     
      
    19 It was not the Crown case that Scottish Pacific had suffered any financial loss as a result of the five transactions in which he was involved. The Crown had informed his Honour that the loss in the agreed facts related to “later invoices that were not met” and represented “the statement by the liquidators as to the deficiency after the company went into receivership”. 
     
      
    20 The applicant was charged with (including the Form 1 offences) five specific offences. The statement of agreed facts demonstrated that in respect of each of these transactions Scottish Pacific had been paid and no loss was suffered. Mr Fogarty, a chartered accountant, during his evidence confirmed that in relation to all of the false State invoices, Scottish Pacific had received all monies due and suffered no financial loss. 
     
      
    21 The Judge found that the substantial loss sustained by Scottish Pacific was a feature of aggravation (ROS at 32). His Honour was there referring to s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (Crimes (SP) Act) which relevantly provides that one of the aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence is: 
     
      
       
        
        “(g) the …………………, loss caused by the offence was substantial.” 
        
       
       
      There was no loss caused by the applicant’s offending and his Honour, with respect, erred in making this finding.  
       
      
    22 The Judge accepted the Crown submission that the applicant was closely involved in the planning, even if not the prime mover of the offences and appears to have found that his involvement in the planning was a factor of aggravation (ROS at 32). His Honour, it seems, was referring to s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (SP) Act. Such a finding required proof beyond reasonable doubt and with respect his Honour could not be so satisfied on the available evidence.  
     
      
    23 The Judge ranked the offences with which the applicant had been charged as demonstrating a high degree of criminality for the same reasons as he had similarly assessed the criminality of the offending by the Gomes brothers (ROS at 26). The Gomes brothers had been charged with twelve counts with 61 offences being included on a Form 1. A total amount of $2,044,644.72 was involved in their offending. The offences had been meticulously planned and the Gomes brothers were financially advantaged. The applicant had not received a financial benefit by his participation in the offending nor had there been a high degree of planning. The offences as alleged do not demonstrate criminality of a high degree.  
     
      
    24 Grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal have, in my opinion, been established.  
     
      
    25 It is convenient now to deal with ground 4 of the appeal which is that his Honour erred in failing to reflect an appropriate disparity of sentences between the applicant and the principal co-offenders such that the applicant had suffered a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    26 The Gomes brothers were each sentenced by his Honour to terms of imprisonment the effective head sentence of which was four years ten months and one week with an effective non-parole period of two years eleven months and three weeks. The sentences commenced on 29 March 2007 and they are eligible for release to parole 7 March 2010. The 12 counts to which they pleaded guilty were laid pursuant to s 176A of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is ten years imprisonment.  
     
      
    27 The Crown concedes that the sentencing remarks of the Judge do disclose anomalies in the manner in which his Honour sentenced each offender and points out that the two principal offenders, the Gomes brothers received a non-parole period of just less than a year longer than the applicant in circumstances where they were being dealt with for 12 offences on the indictment and 62 offences on a Form 1. The Crown notes that their offences carried a maximum penalty that was twice that for the applicant’s offences. 
     
      
    28 It appears to me that his Honour’s approach to sentencing the applicant was infected by the error of the assessment of the applicant’s criminality being of the same high range of seriousness as the Gomes brothers. Plainly it was not. 
     
      
    29 Samuel Bikhit had pleaded guilty to two counts in similar terms to those charged against the applicant. The amount involved in total $212,354.23. On each count, he was sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen months, made up of a non-parole period of twelve months and a balance of term of six months. Mr Bikhit’s sentence was quashed by this Court after the Court expressed concern about the charges which alleged that he was an accessory to the defrauding of Scottish Pacific by the Gomes brothers. When this Court re-sentenced Mr Bikhit an order was made under s 10A of the Crimes (SP) Act to the effect that the proceedings be disposed of on the basis that no other penalty be imposed.  
     
      
    30 The applicant has shown that a reasonable person looking at the circumstances of the case would regard his grievance as justified: R v Ilbay [2000] NSWCCA 251 [at 6], R v Kollas & Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 491 [at paras 45-50]. The sentences imposed by the Judge give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    31 Ground 5 of the appeal is that his Honour erred in the manner in which he took into account the applicant’s assistance to authorities.  
     
      
    32 The applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 19 September 2006. In an affidavit tendered on sentence, Superintendent Dyson deposed that when the appellant was charged in May 2006 he indicated his intention at that time to plead guilty and expressed a willingness to assist the police. 
     
      
    33 On 10 November 2006 he signed an “Undertaking to Give Evidence” against the Gomes brothers and four other alleged accessories at “any proceedings (including any appeal and re-trial)”. Superintendent Dyson opined that the applicants assistance was “significant” and “substantially strengthened the police brief”.  
     
      
    34 When the Judge sentenced the Gomes brothers he discounted their sentences by 35 per cent. It seems from his Honour’s remarks that this discount was given for the utilitarian value of the pleas and for remorse. The Judge when sentencing the applicant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Baldini, with the advantage of his offer of worthwhile assistance to the authorities and his very early plea of guilty with its significant utilitarian value in a case such as this is likewise entitled to a 35% discount on sentences.” (ROS at 36).  
        
       
      
    35 The Crown concedes that the applicant does not appear to have received any additional discount for his assistance to authorities when his discount is compared with that of the principal offenders. This Court has been informed this morning that the applicant has given evidence at a trial against two alleged offenders.  
     
      
    36 It seems that his Honour did not properly reflect on the appropriate discounts to be given. The discount allowed to the Gomes brothers for the utilitarian value of their pleas and remorse was, in my opinion, excessive. The applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court and a discount of 20 to 25 per cent for his plea was appropriate. A discount of 15 per cent for past and future assistance was within an appropriate range. This Court has emphasised that a discount for a plea and assistance of more than 40 per cent should be very exceptionally, if at all, granted where there is no evidence that the offender will spend the sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population: see Regina v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92 per Howie J at [5]. There was no such evidence before the Judge. 
     
      
    37 The applicant, however, is entitled to feel aggrieved by the manner in which the discounts were assessed. To my mind, a discount of 40 per cent for the plea and assistance was appropriate.  
     
      
    38 Ground 3 of the appeal is that his Honour did not give appropriate weight to the mitigating factors available to the applicant. Ground 6 of the appeal is that his Honour erred in the application of a finding of special circumstances in the sentence.  
     
      
    39 In his sentencing remarks the Judge did not refer to the applicant’s subjective circumstances until he came to consider special circumstances. His Honour was required to give consideration to the subjective circumstances in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence and his consideration was not to be confined to a finding of special circumstances. There was before his Honour a probation and parole report which referred favourably to the applicant as a hardworking person who is family orientated. He had established his own business but due to issues associated with the offences was declared bankrupt in 2005. Whilst he has a limited criminal history, there have been no offences since 1996. The Judge considered but for the present offences the applicant had made a successful rehabilitation. His Honour found special circumstances noting his first time in prison, his valuable assistance, remorse and contrition. 
     
      
    40 Although special circumstances were found, the applicant received an overall head sentence of 30 months and a non-parole period of 24 months. It appears that his Honour made a miscalculation as the balance of the term of the sentence was intended to exceed one third of the non-parole period.  
     
      
    41 I turn to the principal issue in this appeal. This Court in Bikhit v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 202 considered the charges which had been laid against Mr Bikhit. Those charges were in the same terms as those brought against the applicant. The first count on the indictment is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1.  
        Alfred Gomes and Jose Gomes 
         between 6 January 2003 and 21 January, 2003 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, being directors of a body corporate, namely Smartpak Australia Pty Limited, did defraud Scottish Pacific Business Finance Pty Limited, by factoring three false invoices in the name of State Packaging Pty Limited for the amount of $116,639-60 to Scottish Pacific Business Finance Pty Limited, and the Director of Public Prosecutions aforesaid charges that  
        Paul Enzo Baldini 
        , a director of State Packaging Pty Limited, knowing the said Alfred and Jose Gomes to have committed the said serious indictable offence in the manner aforesaid, afterwards, namely on or about 2 June 2003 in the said State did receive, harbour, maintain and assist the said Alfred Gomes and Jose Gomes”.  
        
       
      
     Counts 2 and 3 are in identical terms save for dates and amounts.  
     
      
    42 In Bikhit Simpson J (with whom Beazley JA and Grove J agreed) after noting that the charge alleged that Mr Bikhit was an accessory to the actual defrauding of Scottish Pacific by the Gomes brothers found that the evidence failed to establish that Scottish Pacific was deprived or defrauded of anything in respect of the transactions in which Mr Bikhit had been involved. Simpson J said [at 49]: 
     
      
       
        
        ‘“Defraud” is not defined in the  
        Crimes Act 
        . However, it has been the subject of judicial consideration on a number of occasions. Some of the authorities are referred to in Howie and Johnson:  
        Criminal Practice and Procedure NSW 
        , LexisNexis Butterworths 1998 at pp 116, 626 in the notes to s 176A of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . In my opinion to “defraud” necessarily imports a loss to the victim of something of value. I acknowledge that the loss may be intangible, although, it must, in my opinion, at best involve prejudice to the victim’s “proprietary rights” ( 
        R v Negline 
         (NSWCCA, 5 December 1990)).’ 
        
       
      
    43 Her Honour went on to say that there was no “defrauding” of Scottish Pacific which was an essential element of each offence charged. 
     
      
    44 Grove J [at 7] said that it was difficult to identify how Mr Bikhit was an accessory after the fact to the defrauding.  
     
      
    45 Similar difficulties arise in the case of the applicant. The evidence as I have said demonstrates that in respect of the five specific offences of which the applicant was charged, Scottish Pacific had received all monies due and suffered no loss. Hence the evidence failed to establish that Scottish Pacific was deprived or defrauded of anything in respect of the transactions in which the applicant was involved. There was no “defrauding” of Scottish Pacific which was an essential element of each offence charged. 
     
      
    46 The applicant pleaded guilty to the charges and has served almost eight months of his sentence. He was undoubtedly involved in serious acts of dishonesty. He allowed false invoices in the name of State to be produced by the Gomes brothers and acknowledged the false invoices by accepting monthly statements in which the false invoices appeared. As was said by Simpson J in Bikhit [at 53] had he been charged, for example, with being an accessory to an offence of obtaining a benefit by deception( s 178BA) his pleas would have been appropriate.  
     
      
    47 Error having been identified, I am of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should be passed. 
     
      
       
       
      
    48 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Leave to appeal be granted. 
        
       
      
     (ii) Quash the sentences imposed for counts 1, 2 and 3. 
     
      
       
        
        (iii) Re-sentence the applicant under s 6(3) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912 making an order under s 10A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        1999 on each count to the effect that the proceedings be disposed of on the basis that no other penalty be imposed. 
        
       
      
     (iv) Order the release of the applicant forthwith.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed, pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against the rejection by Neilson DCJ of evidence sought to be adduced by the Crown as tendency evidence in the respondent’s trial. For the reasons which follow, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    2 Section 11 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 prohibits, with some exceptions, the publication or broadcasting of the name of, and material that identifies or is likely to lead to the identification of, a person mentioned in criminal proceedings in relation to something that occurred when the person was a child. The persons referred to in these reasons as MA, JC and AR are such persons. They are referred to by initials. So is the mother of MA and, because it is necessary that the reasons include that he is the father of JC, the respondent. 
     
      
       
      The charged offences and the tendency evidence 
       
      
    3 The respondent was charged with two sexual offences against MA (“the complainant”). The complainant is the daughter of LA, with whom the respondent had commenced to have a sexual relationship in late 2006. It involved sometimes the respondent staying at LA’s house and sometimes LA and the complainant staying at the respondent’s house. The first charge was of aggravated indecent assault (Crimes Act, 1900, s 61M(1)). The second charge was of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent (Crimes Act, s 61J(1)). Both offences were alleged to have taken place at LA’s house between 1 November 2006 and 15 December 2006. The complainant was then 12 years old, that being the circumstances of aggravation in both charges. 
     
      
    4 On 17 September 2007 the respondent was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to each of the charges. The Crown had given notice of its intention to adduce tendency evidence, and there was an immediate voir dire hearing on the admissibility of the evidence. Documents were tendered, relevantly the Crown brief for the two charges including the tendency evidence being the indictment, Form 1, facts sheets and complainants’ statements relating to the respondent’s pleas of guilty in 1997 to charges of sexual offences against JC and AR. The Crown said that it proposed to tender as tendency evidence the two facts sheets “and/or” the statement of JC and identified parts of the statement of AR; no doubt in some manner there would also be evidence of the respondent’s admission to at least the facts sheets.  
     
      
    5 From records of interview with the complainant in the Crown brief, the two offences with which the respondent was charged occurred on the one occasion. The respondent was at LA’s house. He had drawn a bath for the complainant. The complainant bathed and went to her brother’s room to dry herself and dress. In the bathroom or while she was drying herself and dressing the respondent touched her on her breasts and squeezed her nipples, this giving rise to the charge of aggravated indecent assault. The respondent also parted her labia and looked into her vagina and manipulated her clitoris, this giving rise to the charge of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent.  
     
      
    6 According to the complainant, at the time he was touching her the respondent asked her what the round circle was and told her it was a vagina hole, and said “When you get older can I lick it?”. She said that the respondent touched on her “rude parts” about twice, and that when she was in her brother’s bedroom the respondent asked whether, when she got older, she wanted to have sex.  
     
      
    7 JC is the respondent’s daughter. The facts sheet recorded incidents in April 1987, when she was 10 years old, and in May 1996, when she was 19 years old. The Crown accepted before the judge that the latter incident could not be used as tendency evidence given her age at the time, and it was thus excluded from the proposed tender: however, as later mentioned it could be material to the admissibility of the remaining tendency evidence. As to the former incident, JC and the respondent were alone in the family home; the respondent pulled her shorts and underpants down and put his finger in her vagina and moved it around; he lay on top of her and was touching her breasts and body and pushed his penis against her vagina until it went inside. The facts sheet included - 
     
      
       
        
        “The victim recalls that the defendant then started having sex with her regularly and that he would sneak into her bedroom at night and put his hand over her mouth. He then would have sex with her again. He also touched her a lot and would also lick her vagina.” 
        
       
      
    8 JC’s statement so far as concerned with the 1987 incident was generally to the same effect, but included that prior to the incident the respondent touched JC all over outside her clothes and said things like, “Does that feel good?”. It was more graphic, and spoke of the pain and fright experienced by JC. It also included that thereafter there was regular sex and “he used to touch me a lot and lick my vagina”. At the commencement of the statement it was said in general terms, “My father has had regular sexual intercourse with me since I was ten years old and has had sex with me on more than one hundred occasions”.  
     
      
    9 It is convenient to note at this point the May 1996 incident involving JC. The respondent and JC’s mother had separated, and the respondent was living elsewhere. He came to the house when JC was alone. He had forced sexual intercourse with JC, from which she became pregnant. 
     
      
    10 AR was a friend of JC. She lived with JC’s family for about 3 months. The facts sheet recorded incidents in December 1995, January 1996 and March 1996, spanning the living with the family. In December 1995, when AR was 14 years old, the family members were at a carnival at a coastal town. Alcohol and marijuana were consumed. The respondent and AR walked through the sand dunes. They stopped and sat down, and AR went in and out of sleep due to her drugged and intoxicated state. At waking times she found the respondent’s hand on the middle of her thigh, then his forefinger in her vagina. In January 1996 AR walked with the respondent at his request, during which he pinched her on the bottom and put his hand up her skirt to about a centimetre from her vagina. In March 1996 AR had just turned 15. She was asleep at the family home, and awoke to find the respondent sitting on her bed with his hand under the sheet touching her vagina. 
     
      
    11 AR’s statement was again generally to the same effect, but it was more detailed, and the paragraphs nominated by the Crown included that after returning from the sand dunes she rebuffed the respondent’s attempt to put his hand up her skirt and he said, “What, can’t I play with your pussy any more”. They also included that from early 1996 the respondent made comments to her like “You’re so beautiful”, “You’ve got nice legs” (there were others which I do not set out), with what AR described as a slimy smile. 
     
      
    12 The Crown contended in the tendency notice that the proposed evidence in the two facts sheets and the statements of JC and AR was admissible to prove that the respondent had a tendency - 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) to carry out acts of the following sexual nature: 
         
         
          
          (a) touching of breasts; 
          
         
         
         (b) touching of vagina; and 
         
         
         (c) digital penetration of the vagina. 
         
         
        (ii) upon girls aged between 10 and 16 years; 
         
         
        (iii) that are known to him; 
         
         
        (iv) while they were under his authority;  
         
         
        (v) at the girl’s place of residence; and 
         
         
        (vi) make explicit comments of a sexual nature to the girls.” 
        
       
      
    13 The Crown also contended that the evidence was admissible to prove that the respondent had a tendency “to have a particular state of mind, namely, a guilty passion or sexual interest in girls aged between 10 and 16 years.”  
     
      
       
      Admissability of tendency evidence 
       
      
    14 “Tendency evidence” is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995 to mean “evidence of a kind referred to in subsection 97(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection”. 
     
      
    15 Section 97(1) of the Evidence Act, applicable to both civil and criminal proceedings, relevantly provides - 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if:  
         
         
          
          … 
           
           
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    16 Section 101(2) of the Evidence Act, applicable only to criminal proceedings, provides - 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    17 In the Dictionary “probative value of evidence” is defined to mean “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue.”  
     
      
    18 Section 97(1) is concerned with admissibility of evidence. The difficulty with s 101(2), in terms apparently concerned with use of evidence once it has beeen admitted, has been noted in, for example, R v Nassif [2004] NSWCCA 443 at [46]-[47], R v Fletcher (2005) 156 A Crim R 308, [2005] NSWCCA 338 at [45]-[48] and R v Zhang (2005) 158 A Crim R 504 at [39], [125]. Despite its terms, it has been treated as a rule for the exclusion of evidence: R v Ellis (2003) 58 NSWLR 700 at [54]; R v Zhang. It was so treated by the Crown and the respondent in the present case, and there is no occasion to question the treatment.  
     
      
       
      The judge’s reasons 
       
      
    19 The judge first outlined the charges and evidence in the Crown brief. As well as the complainant’s records of interview the Crown brief included statements of LA, of a teacher at the complainant’s school and of the school principal, to which I will later refer. His Honour outlined the 1996 charges and the incidents involving JC and AR.  
     
      
    20 The judge set out the tendency to carry out the acts of a sexual nature for which the Crown contended, describing it as a submission, but did not refer to the asserted tendency to have a state of mind. The judge said - 
     
      
       
        
        “30. There is force in each of those submissions from the facts that I have outlined. However, most acts of heterosexual intercourse will involve touching the breasts and touching of the vagina and some form of penetration of the vagina. Furthermore, most forms of sexual intercourse, whether heterosexual or homosexual, will involve making comments of a sexual nature. There are obvious similarities between the tendency evidence and the acts alleged against the accused and there are also dissimilarities. The similarities are placed in a schedule in Exhibit VD8 and the dissimilarities are contained as part of the written submissions on behalf of the accused which are MFI 2. 
        
       
       
        
        31. Clearly each of the current complainant, JC and AR, were aged between ten and sixteen. However, the current complainant was pre-pubertal whereas both JC and AR were post pubertal. It is clear that the accused was a parent of JC and stood essentially in loco parentis to both AR and the current complainant. In saying that the accused stood in loco parentis to the current complainant, I must point out that there was no male normally resident in the current complainant’s house, but the accused was having sexual relations with the complainant’s mother and indeed the complainant’s mother had stated that she had started telling the complainant about the ‘facts of life’ and she had asked the accused to talk to the complainant, from a man’s point of view, as to what happens with the male body and to ask the complainant to be careful as she could be sexually active when she started high school in the following year and the complainant needed to be aware of how boys might try to talk her into having sexual relationships with them. In other words the complainant’s mother had placed the accused in the place of a parent, in the place of a father towards the complainant. But for the assault upon AR in the sand dunes at Forster, the other offences occurred in the home of the complainant in premises that were either permanently or temporarily being used to accommodate the complainant. The circumstances of the assault upon AR in the sand dunes at Forster involved alcohol and marijuana, whereas none of the others do. There was digital penetration of each of JC, AR and the complainant, although the digital penetration of JC was a forerunner to penile penetration. There is no suggestion in the evidence of AR of any proclivity of the accused to cunnilingus but clearly it was a matter raised by the accused, if the evidence, of course, be accepted of the complainant and the complainant’s mother and such a proclivity is mentioned in the evidence of JC.” 
        
       
      
    21 The judge found in decisions of this Court a three step approach, saying - 
     
      
       
        
        “34. The dictionary attached to the  
        Evidence Act  
        defines probative value of evidence to mean: ‘the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue’. As was stated in  
        R v Fletcher 
         [2005] NSWCCA 338, in  
        R v Zhang 
         [2005] NSWCCA 437 and by Simpson J in  
        R v Gardner 
         [2006] NSWCCA 190 and in  
        R v Ngatikaura 
         [2006] NSWCCA 161 the question of admissibility involves three steps or questions: 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Is the evidence capable of being ascribed probative value? 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Does the evidence, when considered alone or in conjunction with other evidence adduced or to be adduced, have significant probative value? and 
         
         
        (3) Does the probative value substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect? 
        
       
       
        
        If the answer to any of these questions is ‘No’ the evidence is not admissible under s 97 as tendency evidence.” 
        
       
      
    22 It may be observed that the third question arises under s 101(2), and admissibility under s 97 was elided with the application of that subsection. 
     
      
    23 The judge first asked whether the evidence was capable of being ascribed probative value. He said, referring to authority, that it was not sufficient that the respondent engaged in sexual misconduct with JC and AR and allegedly with the complainant, and that it was necessary that there be “a significant similarity in the conduct or a pattern of some sort or a modus operandi that can be determined by looking at all the conduct involving each child, not by analysing each act separately”. Noting that examination of the similarities and dissimilarities was, although relevant, not determinative, he said that he had sought to set out the evidence to show the similarities and dissimilarities, and that having carefully considered them he concluded that the tendency evidence was capable of rationally affecting the probability of whether the respondent digitally penetrated the complainant and touched her on the breasts as she alleged. 
     
      
    24 The judge then asked whether the evidence when considered alone or in conjunction with other evidence adduced or to be adduced had significant probative value. He concluded - 
     
      
       
        
        “41. Tendency evidence is placed before a jury as evidence tending to prove the guilt of the accused. If admitted it is as Howie J said in  
        Harker  
        [ 
        R v Harker 
         [2004] NSWCCA 427] positive proof of guilt. The jury are asked to reason that because the accused acted in a particular way on some other occasion or occasions with another girl or girls he or she must have acted in the same way on another occasion with the complainant. In the present case the Crown wishes to adduce the evidence in order to argue that because the accused acted in a particular way with both JC and AR he must have acted in the same way towards the current complainant MA. 
        
       
       
        
        42. In my view it would be open to the jury to see the tendency evidence as important or of consequence when viewed with the other evidence in determining if the accused digitally penetrated the complainant as alleged in the indictment and sexually assaulted her as alleged in the first count in the indictment. I would reach the same conclusion myself without needing to predict a jury’s approach which was the approach favoured by Basten JA in his dissenting judgment in  
        Zhang 
         and majority of the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal adopted in  
        L v Tasmania 
         [2006] TASSC 89.” 
        
       
      
    25 The judge then asked whether the probative value substantially outweighed the prejudicial effect. He said at [47] that s 101(2) required the court to consider the prejudice in each case, not solely the presumed prejudice where evidence of an accused’s bad character is placed before the jury. His reasoning to answering his question in the negative should be set out in full - 
     
      
       
        
        “49. … If the tendency evidence be admitted, it would be open to the accused to argue that he made admissions when he did wrong things, and pleaded guilty in connection with his conduct towards JC and AR, and the jury could be assured that if he did the wrong things currently alleged by MA, he would have admitted those offences as well. However, I do not see that as a powerful argument militating against prejudice that this evidence will undoubtedly cause in the jurors’ minds. In this court’s experience, evidence of limited good character, such as, ‘I am a petty thief, I am not a drug supplier’, rarely carries weight with a jury, and the argument indicated is akin to arguments presented when evidence of limited good character is placed before a jury. 
        
       
       
        
        50. In the current matter, it is not evidence of limited good character or limited bad character. Rather it is evidence of bad character of the very type alleged in the counts in the indictment. Notwithstanding the warnings that a trial judge must give, and the possible positive use that the accused might make of the tendency evidence, the jury will be invited to use the tendency evidence to reason that because the accused molested his own daughter, and AR, he did the same thing to MA. Evidence only has probative weight if it is considered rationally. If the tendency evidence is admitted, the jury will know that the accused is a self-confessed child molester. Of course, the trial judge will need to tell the jury that the accused has been punished for those crimes and must not be punished for them again by a verdict based on emotional, and not rational consideration. 
        
       
       
        
        51. Sexual molestation of children is a very emotive issue in the community. That is completely understandable, and a concern of every parent. Frequently one seeks and hears it discussed, not only in the media, both irrationally and in emotive ways. No matter how many times a jury is told to be objective and dispassionate, that in the context of the trial of a self-confessed child molester is, to use the vernacular, a big ask. One cannot ignore the risk of, at least, one juror being unable, either consciously or unconsciously to ignore such directions, and to consider the matter emotionally and irrationally. Such an approach may mean that the juror closes his or her ears and mind to the warnings as to how the tendency evidence may help the accused on the question of the complainant’s credibility. There is a possibility that the issue of credibility may be ignored altogether. The potential for very great prejudice remains regardless of what could be said by the trial judge to ameliorate it. 
        
       
       
        
        52. The tendency evidence does have significant probative value. However, it is not crucial to the Crown case in the sense that if it is not admitted, the offences alleged cannot be established. There is corroboration for the complainant, MA, on the question of the discussion of cunnilingus from her mother, and on the question of a sudden change in behaviour of the complainant from both the principal of the school, and the teacher’s aide, to whose evidence I have referred. 
        
       
       
        
        53. A jury may be persuaded to listen to the complainant’s evidence more sympathetically because of her mild intellectual disability. It is clear from the electronic record of interview with the complainant, that unusually, these days, for a twelve year old, she is very sexually, or was at the time of the interview, sexually unaware. She could initially only refer to her vagina as her ‘rude part’, and as the source from which her ‘wee’ came. Subsequently, she remembered that that part of her body was called the ‘pussy’, and then much later in her record of interview, she said that that part of her anatomy was the ‘vagina hole’, a term used by the accused to her. 
        
       
       
        
        54. Having presided in a number of trials of this nature here at Campbelltown, I have found juries to be reluctant to accept the evidence of girls as young as twelve of sexual molestation, when it is clear they are very sexually aware. It is clear from the transcripts of the ERISP before me that here the complainant is very sexually unaware. In my view, that makes the Crown case stronger than it might otherwise be. The tendency evidence here is not overwhelming as it was in  
        Ellis 
         [ 
        R v Ellis 
         (2003) 58 NSWLR 700], where the modus operandi included the removal of a full pane of glass, which the evidence disclosed was rare and, therefore, very distinctive. 
        
       
       
        
        55. Viewed objectively, the similarities here are not as compelling as in  
        Nassif 
         [ 
        R v Nassif 
         [2004] NSWCCA 433], where there were four separate sets of offences involving bizarre assaults on a young woman in broad daylight in Marrickville, Leichhardt, Croydon or Burwood, where the offender used a stolen Ford, wore no disguise, and exhibited a motive of sexual intent. Identity of the offender was the issue in that trial. The evidence here is not in the same category as either the evidence in  
        Milton 
         [ 
        R v Milton  
        [2004] NSWCCA 195],  
        Fletcher  
        [ 
        R v Fletcher 
         [2005] NSWCCA 338] 
          
        or  
        Harker 
        , or indeed, the evidence in  
        L v Tasmania 
        . The evidence in  
        Milton 
        ,  
        Fletcher 
         and  
        Harker 
         has been summed up succinctly in the written submissions, on behalf of the accused, and I need not recite it further. Section 101(2) requires more than the competing considerations of prejudice and probative value of the tendency evidence being evenly balanced. It requires more than the scales being tipped slightly in favour of the probative value of the evidence. The scales must be tipped substantially in that direction. 
        
       
       
        
        56. I am not persuaded that that is the case here. Accordingly, I reject the tendency evidence. I have borne in mind the balancing exercise, as required by s 101(2), and also the approach of McHugh JA in  
        Pfenning v The Queen 
         [(1995) 182 CLR 461] at 529 that was quoted in [11] of  
        R v RN 
         [2006] NSWCCA 423. For those reasons the tendency evidence is rejected.” 
        
       
       
      The competency of the appeal 
       
      
    26 Section 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides for appeal by the Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case.” 
        
       
      
    27 The Crown has the onus of demonstrating that the decision or ruling has eliminated or substantially weakened the prosecution’s case: R v Shamouil (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 at [30].  
     
      
    28 The Crown submitted that the exclusion of the tendency evidence substantially weakened its case against the respondent. The respondent submitted that there was considerable evidence supporting the complainant’s allegations against the respondent, and that the Crown had not discharged its onus. It might be thought odd that the Crown should argue for the weakness of its case against the respondent and the respondent should argue for the strength of the Crown case against him. That is a consequence of the qualification in s 5F(3A). The oddity may explain why neither side’s submissions went into detail. 
     
      
    29 As I have indicated, the Crown brief included records of interview with the complainant. There were two interviews, one on 12 December 2006 and the other on 26 April 2007. Both interviews were undertaken by a police officer and a case worker from DOCS. The records of interview were quite lengthy, and within them could be found the facts earlier briefly stated for the offences charged against the respondent. 
     
      
    30 Apart from the records of interview and associated statements of the police officer and the case worker, there were in the Crown brief statements of LA, of Mrs Loraine Collings and of Miss Sandra Martin.  
     
      
    31 Mrs Collings was a teacher at the complainant’s school. In her statement she referred to a change in the complainant’s behaviour from mid-October 2006, including that the complainant “began to display sexualised behaviour”. Mrs Collings was told that the complainant and a boy at the school “took their shirts off … and wanted to hump”. 
     
      
    32 Mrs Collings recounted some talk with the complainant about the respondent, whom the complainant referred to her “step-dad” or “step-father”, causing her to take the complainant to the school principal, Miss Martin. In Miss Martin’s office, according to the statement - 
     
      
       
        
        “Sandra Martin said to [the complainant], ‘Is there anything else you want to talk about’. 
        
       
       
        
        [The complainant] looked at me, so I said, ‘You mentioned your step-dad.’ 
        
       
       
        
        [The complainant] said, ‘I walked into my brother’s room and my step dad came in. We sat on the edge of the bed. Then he turned on the bath for me and when I was in it, he pulled me apart and told me this is your vagina hole and white stuff comes out of it.’ 
        
       
       
        
        [The complainant] then continued to talk about an incident (time/date was not discussed). 
        
       
       
        
        [The complainant] said, ‘When Mum was cooking dinner in the kitchen, I was sitting on the lounge watching a movie. My step-dad sat next to me and told me to turn the movie off. He talked about private parts and my vagina hole and what boys do and that a boy’s penis goes into a vagina hole. He said that he wants one because that they are nice. He said to me that he wants mine.’” 
        
       
      
    33 The statement of Miss Martin spoke also of change in the complainant’s behaviour, including a report of humping. She gave a quite lengthy account of what was said by the complainant when brought to her by Mrs Collings. It was to the same effect, but more detailed, as that in Mrs Collings’ statement. Miss Martin called DOCS, and in due course came the interviews with the complainant.  
     
      
    34 The statement of LA included in particular (I have reduced the respondent’s first name to an initial) - 
     
      
       
        
        “9. One day I was at home with [G] and [the complainant] came home from school. 
        
       
       
        
        [The complainant] said, ‘[G] said to me that he wants to lick me out’. 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘[G] did you say that?’ 
        
       
       
        
        [G] said, ‘No I was only talking about it.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said to [G], ‘What did you say? Don’t you ever say that ‘cause I’m trying to tell her that she’s not to have sex with boys.’ 
        
       
       
        
        [G] said to me, ‘It was just my fantasy, I just would like to that’s all’.” 
        
       
      
    35 LA was very upset, and there was what LA referred to as a fight. The judge observed, “It would appear that that was the end of the relationship between the complainant’s mother and the accused”.  
     
      
    36 The qualification in s 5F(3A) requires that the Court assess the strength of the Crown case in order to determine whether the exclusion of the tendency evidence substantially weakens it: R v Shamouil at [29] and cases cited. A number of questions arise 
     
      
       
      (a) No current trial 
       
      
    37 The first question is whether, on the authority of R v Milakovic [2004] NSWCCA 199, the necessary assessment is not able to be made because there is no current proceedings, and the Crown case and the tendency evidence at a future trial might be different.  
     
      
    38 Prior to the respondent being arraigned, Neilson DCJ informed the parties that “I won’t be hearing this matter because – I will deal with the voir dire but I can’t hear the matter because I’m returning to Sydney next Friday”. A jury was not empanelled, and it is clear enough that the trial did not proceed beyond his Honour’s ruling excluding the tendency evidence. We do not know what order(s) were made for a future trial. From what we were told at the hearing of the appeal, it is by no means certain that Neilson DCJ will preside at a future trial of the respondent and probable that he will not.  
     
      
    39 It may be that, because it was known that his Honour would not preside, a trial never commenced; if it did, it must have terminated. Putting procedural matters aside, the judge presiding at the future trial will not be bound by the judge’s decision. Whoever presides, the facts on which admissibility of the tendency evidence is to be decided may not be the same, because of a change in the Crown case or a change in the Crown’s proposal to tender tendency evidence (and there is room for change, see later in these reasons). The Crown accepted that this could be so, without demur from the respondent. 
     
      
    40 There could be utility in this Court deciding the appeal. Its decision would in practice be determinative if there is no change in the facts on which admissibility of the tendency evidence is to be decided, and could provide guidance if the facts change. But the qualification in s 5F(3A) is jurisdictional (R v Shamouil at [27]). Utility is not enough – the qualification must be satisfied. 
     
      
    41 In R v Milakovic the presiding judge refused leave to the Crown to cross-examine an unfavourable witness. The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed pursuant to s 5F(3A). The jury was discharged and the accused was further remanded for trial. The appeal was dismissed as incompetent, on the ground that the refusal of leave to cross-examine was not a decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence but also on the ground that the refusal of leave did not eliminate or substantially weaken the Crown case.  
     
      
    42 As to the latter ground, Grove J said - 
     
      
       
        
        “10 A second obstacle to the Crown contention is the requirement that it be demonstrated that the decision or ruling (assuming it is in a given situation on the admissibility of evidence) eliminates or substantially weakens the Crown case. There is no case being currently tried either at the stage of preliminary or full hearing. It is not known whether Mr Bajic [the allegedly unfavourable witness] will or will not adopt the same stance in the forthcoming trial, if he is called. It is not known what the circumstances will be in which the presiding judge at that trial may be asked to make a ruling if an application under s38 of the Evidence Act is made. If these events occur, they will be dealt with by the presiding judge in accordance with whatever circumstances have arisen. The jurisdiction of this Court does not extend to an advisory opinion concerning something which might happen at a future trial. That does not undermine the jurisdiction which may be exercised where a trial is in progress for the purpose of pre-trial rulings specific to  
        lis pendens 
        .  
         
         
        ...  
         
         
        12 It may be useful to draw attention to two matters. Although I find no ambiguity in the expression of s5F(3A) it is instructive to note that in the second reading speech in Parliament introducing the amendment to the Criminal Appeal Act the Minister said:  
         
         
          
          “If an acquittal results from an erroneous evidentiary ruling the Crown has no avenue of appeal against the acquittal. The Crown should therefore be able to test the correctness of such a ruling made during the trial, so that an accused may not derive the benefit of an acquittal secured as a result of an erroneous evidentiary ruling. It is not desirable that criminal trials be unnecessarily disrupted for the purpose of appealing evidentiary rulings. It is therefore anticipated that the Crown would exercise this new appeal power only sparingly”.(Hansard 20 November 2003 pp 5427-5428) 
           
          
         
        ...  
         
         
        14 In the first appeal brought to this Court pursuant to s5F(3A) ( 
        R v NKS  
        [2004] NSWCCA 144) the need for restraint was emphasized. It bears repeating. The jury having been discharged, there is not an extant risk of acquittal based upon any ruling made in the course of a now terminated trial.  
         
         
        15 During the passage of the Bill through Parliament which resulted in the legislation of s5F(3A), a Parliamentary Secretary in the Legislative Council, speaking for the Government and responding to expressed fears (and amendment moved) that the opportunity to appeal was too broad and would result in delays in justice and increased costs, said:  
         
         
          
          “In practice, this appeal mechanism is likely to be used extremely rarely …….. Where the Crown has opposed a decision to exclude evidence and has strong grounds to support an argument that the exclusion of evidence substantially weakens the Crown case, the Crown will advise the trial judge and the trial will be adjourned. The jury is not discharged, as suggested by the Law Society, as an interlocutory appeal is normally heard within a few days – if not the day after the trial judge has excluded the evidence. 
           
           
          It is correct that trials will be delayed for a short period while an interlocutory appeal is heard. However, in the course of trials, juries are regularly excused while voir dire hearings are held to determine questions of law particularly in relation to whether to admit evidence. Sometimes voir dire hearings can take many days”. (Hansard 2 December 2003 pp 5538-5539).” 
          
         
        
       
      
    43 Sperling J said - 
     
      
       
        
        “31 In terms of s5F(3A), an appeal lies under the subsection only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case. That is a question of fact for this court, the burden of proof lying on the appellant.  
         
         
        32 It cannot be found as a fact that the prosecution’s case at the prospective trial is eliminated or substantially weakened by the decision. Apart from whether a judge at the prospective trial would necessarily adopt the decision under appeal in the same circumstances, the occasion for such a ruling might not arise at all or, if it does, might arise in circumstances which are materially different.  
         
         
        33 The appellant has not established that the decision under appeal will eliminate or substantially weaken the prosecution’s case at the prospective trial unless it is quashed.” 
        
       
      
    44 Dowd J agreed with both judgments. 
     
      
    45 In R v ELD [2004] NSWCCA 219 the Director of Public Prosecutions appealed pursuant to s 5F(3A) against the rejection of evidence because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused: Evidence Act, s 137. The ruling was given on a voir dire hearing prior to the empanelling of a jury. An appeal was brought, and the trial was adjourned.  
     
      
    46 Bell J, with whose reasons Howie and Hislop JJ agreed, said - 
     
      
       
        
        “23 The rulings made by the Judge were as to the admissibility of evidence at the trial before her. After announcing them she remanded the respondent for trial on a future date. When the respondent’s trial comes on for hearing it may proceed before another judge. The ruling made by the Judge as to the admission of evidence has not become final as between the Crown and the respondent by the entry of a conviction or an acquittal:  
        Rogers v The Queen 
         (1994) 181 CLR 251;  
        R v GK 
         [2001] NSWCCA 413; 53 NSWLR 317;  
        R v Edwards 
         [1998] 2 VR 354. The judge presiding at the respondent’s trial is not bound to adopt evidentiary rulings made at an earlier aborted trial:  
        R v GK 
         per Mason P at [4] and [5] and Sully J at [74]. It is to be noted that Sully J observed that a ruling excluding evidence under s 137 of the Act made at one trial should be followed at a subsequent trial if the earlier trial had resulted in a verdict that had not been set aside on appeal and if there was no proper basis for distinguishing it: at [77].” 
        
       
      
    47 Her Honour referred to R v Milakovic, citing [10] of the judgment of Grove J, and continued - 
     
      
       
        
        “26 In  
        R v NKS 
         [2004] NSWCCA 144 it was contemplated that a pre-trial determination of the admissibility of evidence might be the subject of an appeal under s 5F(3A) (paragraph [18]). The trial in  
        NKS 
         was on foot at the time the appeal was determined.  
        
       
       
        
        27 In  
        NKS 
         and  
        Milakovic 
         this Court observed that the right of appeal under s 5F(3A) is one that is to be exercised with restraint. The right of appeal allows recourse to this Court to test the correctness of an evidentiary ruling that substantially weakens the Crown case before verdict. The fact that the Director elects to exercise the right to bring an appeal under s 5F(3A) should not ordinarily be an occasion to abort the trial. It appears that it was the Parliament’s intention in enacting s 5F(3A) that appeals under the provision be determined during the currency of the trial. In  
        Milakovic 
         a passage from the second reading speech introducing the amendment into the  
        CAA 
         is set out at paragraph [12]:  
         
         
          
          ‘If an acquittal results from an erroneous evidentiary ruling the Crown has no avenue of appeal against the acquittal. The Crown should therefore be able to test the correctness of such a ruling made during the trial, so that an accused may not derive the benefit of an acquittal secured as the result of an erroneous evidentiary ruling. It is not desirable that criminal trials be unnecessarily disrupted for the purpose of appealing evidentiary rulings. It is therefore anticipated the Crown would exercise this new appeal power sparingly.’ (Hansard, 20 November 2003 pp 5427 – 5428)  
           
          
         
        28 Section 5F(5) provides that this Court may vacate a decision or ruling upon a successful appeal under subs (3A) and give or make some other decision or ruling instead of the one appealed against. Where the trial has been aborted and the accused remanded for trial on some future date new evidence may come to light that is relevant to the exercise of the discretion to refuse to admit the evidence that was the subject of appeal. It is undesirable for this Court to make rulings on the admission of evidence in advance of the trial.  
         
         
        29 No point was taken at the hearing either challenging the competence of the appeal or contending that the Judge’s rulings did not operate to substantially weaken the Crown case. It is appropriate to deal with the appeal in the way it was argued.” 
        
       
      
    48 The appeal was allowed and the judge’s ruling was set aside. Her Honour said at [46] that “[f]or the reasons earlier given” it was not “an appropriate case in which to make rulings instead of those that are the subject of the appeal”. 
     
      
    49 In R v ELD there does not seem to have been a submission that, as later emphasised in R v Shamouil, the qualification in s 5F(3A) is jurisdictional, and the decision did not explore the reasoning in R v Milakovic. In the present case the respondent did take the point that the judge’s ruling did not operate to substantially weaken the Crown case. The respondent did not submit that the appeal was incompetent because there was no current trial, or refer to R v Milakovic, but the jurisdictional question must be addressed. 
     
      
    50 Sperling J in R v Milakovic appears to have considered that futurity of trial, at which the admissibility of the evidence might not arise or the presiding judge might come to a different decision or ruling, meant that the factual finding necessary for satisfaction of the qualification in s 5F(3A) could not be made. Grove J accepted that there could be jurisdiction “where a trial is in progress for the purpose of pre-trial rulings specific to lis pendens“. His Honour considered that discharge of the jury made an appeal at least inappropriate. It is not entirely clear whether he considered that it negated jurisdiction, but he appears to have thought that it could not be demonstrated that the decision or ruling eliminated or substantially weakened the Crown case if there was “no case being currently tried either at the stage of preliminary or full hearing”: at [10]. 
     
      
    51 There are, with respect, difficulties in these views. Rulings may be given after arraignment and prior to the empanelling of the jury, and are part of the trial:  Criminal Procedure Act, 1986, s 130. Despite the parliamentary references to an appeal while the jury is excused cited by Grove J, s 5F(3A) must accommodate the procedure for “pre-trial” rulings for which s 130 provides, and with it the possibility that there will then be an adjournment of the substantive trial and that the judge who makes a ruling will not later preside. It is not uncommon for the trial to be adjourned following a “pre-trial” ruling against which the Director of Public Prosecutions appeals – R v Shamouil was such a case – and there have been many cases in which the appeal has then been entertained. The undesirability of disruption of criminal proceedings does not apply with full force in the case of a “pre-trial” ruling, and the practical difficulties of obtaining immediate hearings in this Court can not be put out of consideration. 
     
      
    52 Further, while trial futurity may make it inappropriate to give an appellate decision or ruling on admissibility in substitution for that appealed against, it does not preclude assessment of the effect on the Crown case by regard to the Crown case ascertained as at the time the decision or ruling at trial was made or as at the time of the appeal. Particularly if the decision or ruling involved assessment of probative value, the judge’s reasons could provide a sufficient understanding of the Crown case; in any event, it will be for the Crown to explain its case in order to discharge its onus. Whether a decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case is at least akin to a question of present fact, to be found by this Court, and need not contemplate what might happen at a future trial.  
     
      
    53 It may be that in some cases the Court can not make a finding because of uncertainty in what the Crown case will be at a future trial, but in my opinion the explanation for R v Milakovic lies in the rather different consideration that, because the occasion for leave to cross-examine the allegedly unfavourable witness might never arise or might arise in different circumstances, any decision in the appeal would be (as Grove J said) no more than an advisory opinion. So far as R v Milakovic suggests that the fact that there will be a fresh decision at the future trial in the circumstances then obtaining necessarily precludes a finding that the prosecution’s case is eliminated or substantially weakened by the decision or ruling under appeal, I respectfully do not agree. 
     
      
    54 In the present case the Court is able to determine whether the exclusion of the tendency evidence substantially weakens the Crown’s case against the respondent. The Crown case is known from the Crown brief and the tendency evidence is known from the facts sheets and the statements of JC and AR. The necessary assessment can be made. 
     
      
       
      (b) Objections to the prosecution’s case 
       
      
    55 Where the decision or ruling is made at a time when the Crown case has not substantially been presented, and particularly when there is a voir dire hearing at the commencement of the trial, it may be uncertain whether all the material in the Crown brief will in due course be admitted against the accused. Is “the prosecution’s case” the evidence which the prosecution proposes to tender, or must there be a forecast of objections, of what the Crown will ultimately press to have admitted, or of what it will succeed in having admitted? We were informed that there is to be objection to the evidence of the complainant via the records of interview, and that a voir dire hearing on that matter has been appointed. (It does not seem that the judge was told of a proposed objection.) Successful objection to this evidence could mean that the prosecution would not continue regardless of the tendency evidence. In other cases the strength of the prosecution’s case could vary other than terminally, depending on objections and evidentiary rulings yet unknown. 
     
      
    56 It was not suggested that the evidence of complaint to Mrs Collings and Miss Martin would be objected to, or was inadmissible; similarly the evidence of LA to which I have referred. Nor did the respondent concede admissibility; there may be objection to (for example) the evidence of change in behaviour and reported humping, and to the complaint to Miss Martin of an incident when the complainant was sitting in the lounge watching a movie. Similarly, there may be particular objection to the tendency evidence. The Crown’s proposal to tender the tendency evidence had two difficulties. One difficulty was the “and/or” in the Crown notice of intention to adduce tendency evidence, because the statement of JC and the parts of the statement of AR went further than the facts sheets. While by his pleas of guilty the respondent presumably admitted the contents of the facts sheets, admission of the contents of the statements may be another matter. The other difficulty was that some of the material was open to objection even if the tendency evidence in principle was admitted. It is sufficient to instance JC’s evidence of sex on more than one hundred occasions, and to question whether the Crown would seek to have before the jury AR’s evidence of the respondent’s “slimy smile”. In this and perhaps other respects there may be the room for change to which I earlier referred. 
     
      
       
      
    57 The Crown accepted in the appeal that, in determining substantial weakening, the prosecution’s case was all that was found in the Crown brief and the tendency evidence. There was no occasion to forecast objections or investigate whether it would succeed in having all the material admitted, which it acknowledged would not be known until the trial. The respondent said that, although there would be objections, it would have to be assumed that “all the evidence would get in”. It is not necessary to resolve this question. Practicality favours regard to what the prosecution proposes to tender, and that is the way the parties argued the appeal. 
     
      
       
      (c) Weight of evidence 
       
      
    58 In R v Shamouil the accused was charged with shooting with intent to murder. The judge rejected evidence of a photo-board identification by the victim. The Crown case that the accused was the offender otherwise consisted of relationships providing motive, telephone calls received by the victim, the offender’s use of a name heard as “Leonard” (the accused’s name was “Linard”), the accused’s access to a vehicle fitting the description of that used by the offender, and a third party’s general description of the offender.  
     
      
    59 Spigelman CJ, with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed, concluded - 
     
      
       
        
        “37 The Respondent’s submission which directs attention to the remaining Crown evidence – telephone, car, relationship, the name “Leonard” – is a case that is of some substance. However, a clear forceful and unhesitating identification on the first occasion by the victim is evidence of particular force. Its absence will, in my opinion, “substantially weaken” the Crown case. Even a case which is otherwise likely, even very likely, to succeed, may still be ‘substantially weakened’, if evidence of cogency or force is withheld.” 
        
       
      
    60 The Chief Justice continued - 
     
      
       
        
        “38 As noted above, counsel for the Respondent submitted that the evidence of identification was itself so weak that its absence could not be said to  
        substantially weaken  
        the Crown case. In my opinion, this approach is not appropriate. 
         
         
        39 The issue is similar to that which arises when determining the probative value of evidence in the context of the application of s 137 of the  
        Evidence Act, 
         to which I will refer below. The jurisdictional issue posed for this Court under s 5F (3A) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act  
        is not intended to involve an inquiry into the weight to be given to the evidence excluded. Questions of weight are for the jury. The section directs attention to “the prosecution’s case”, to be considered as a “case”. This section is not concerned with the weight of the Crown’s evidence. 
         
         
        40 This Court should determine whether or not a ruling on the admissibility of evidence “substantially weakens” the Crown case by asking whether or not that would be the effect, on the assumption that the jury accepted the evidence, as long as the evidence was fit to be left to the jury. It is not desirable for this Court to undertake an investigation into the weight of the evidence based on credibility or reliability considerations.” 
        
       
      
    61 His Honour was dealing with a submission as to the weakness of the excluded evidence, but as evidence part of the Crown case. Speaking of the Crown case as a whole, he was saying that s 5F(3A) was not concerned with the weight of the Crown’s evidence: it was not appropriate to evaluate on reliability or credibility grounds either the Crown case apart from the excluded evidence or the excluded evidence.  
     
      
    62 His Honour’s consideration foreshadowed at [39] in relation to determining probative value included - 
     
      
       
        
        “60 The preponderant body of authority in this Court is in favour of a restrictive approach to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility are to be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence for purposes of determining questions of admissibility. There is no reason to change that approach.  
         
         
        61 In my opinion, the critical word in this regard is the word  
        could  
        in the definition of probative value as set out above, namely, “the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment …”. The focus on  
        capability  
        draws attention to what it is  
        open 
         for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is  
        likely  
        to conclude. Evidence has “probative value”, as defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty.  
         
         
        62 This conclusion is reinforced by the test that evidence must “rationally affect” the assessment. As Gaudron J emphasised in  
        Adam  
        [ 
        Adam v The Queen 
         (2001) 207 CLR 96], a “test” of ‘rationality’ also directs attention to capability rather than weight.  
         
         
        63 There will be circumstances, as envisaged by Simpson J in  
        Cook  
        [ 
        R v Cook 
         [2004] NSWCCA 52], where issues of credibility or reliability are such that it is possible for a court to determine that it would not be open to the jury to conclude that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue. In that limited sense McHugh J’s observations in  
        Papakosmas  
        [ 
        Papakosmas 
          
        v The Queen 
         (1999) 196 CLR 297] 
          
        that “considerations of reliability are necessarily involved” have application.  
         
         
        64 To adopt any other approach would be to usurp for a trial judge critical aspects of the traditional role of a jury. In the case of evidence of critical significance, such a ruling by a trial judge would, in substance, be equivalent to directing a verdict of acquittal on the basis that the trial judge was of the view that a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. As the High Court said in that different, but not irrelevant, context in  
        Doney v The Queen  
        (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 275, this is not a permissible “basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function”. In my opinion, the same is true if a trial judge can determine the weight of evidence when applying s137.  
         
         
        65 This Court should be very slow to conclude that it was the intention of Parliament in enacting the  
        Evidence Act  
        to alter the fundamental relationship between the judge and jury in a criminal trial in the manner suggested. Such a change would occur on each occasion that “probative value” falls to be assessed by the trial judge including: tendency and coincidence evidence (s97(1)(b), s98(1)(b), s101(2)); cross-examination on credit (s103(1)); the comparative weight with misleading, confusing, or time wasting effects (s135(b) and (c)); and the comparative weight with unfair prejudice (s135(a), s137).” 
        
       
      
    63 What did the Chief Justice mean by credibility or reliability considerations? The victim had positively identified the accused from the photo-board, but he later said that he could not recall any physical details of the assailant. His Honour recorded at [34] the submission that the photographic identification was weakened by the victim’s later retraction and his divergent statements about whether he had previously seen the assailant. The victim had also given a detailed physical description of the assailant, to which the retraction was also material, although the consistency of the description with the appearance of the accused was disputed. These matters did not enter into consideration. The positive identification, if evidence fit to be left to the jury, was to be taken at face value in the determination of substantial weakening. 
     
      
    64 If the same goes for the prosecution case as a case, the evidence in the Crown case other than the excluded evidence is also to be taken at face value provided it is fit to be left to the jury. In R v Shamouil there was no other clear identification of the accused – the Chief Justice described the case as to the identity of the assailant as circumstantial. In the present case, unlike in R v Shamouil, the evidence of the complainant, if accepted, would suffice to establish the offences with which the respondent is charged. Should it be determined that because, absent investigation of reliability or credibility considerations, the prosecution’s case would be fully made out by the complainant’s evidence, rejection of the tendency evidence would not eliminate or substantially weaken it? 
     
      
    65 Such an approach to weakening would be consistent with use by the Crown of the appeal mechanism only where acquittal would result from an erroneous evidentiary ruling. But it would be rather unrealistic. Not everything in the prosecution’s case survives testing at the trial. The prosecution is entitled to call more than one witness or tender more than one document to prove the one matter, and to support by other evidence acceptance of the evidence of a critical witness. The approach would greatly restrict Crown appeals pursuant to s 5F(3A) where the decision or ruling could in reality be significant in the outcome at the trial. 
     
      
    66 As Spigelman CJ said in R v Shamouil at [37], a case which is very likely to succeed may still be substantially weakened if evidence of cogency or force is withheld. Although in the assessment of the strength of the Crown case credibility and reliability considerations going to its weight are generally put aside, the strength is not a matter of one witness or document sufficient for proof of a matter. As an abstract illustration, assume that the critical fact in the prosecution’s case is that the cat was black. One witness will say that the cat was black; that evidence is fit to go to the jury, and in accordance with R v Shamouil it is to be assumed that the jury will accept it. A second witness will also say that the cat was black. In my opinion, it could properly be said that exclusion of the evidence of the second witness would substantially weaken the Crown case; instead of two witnesses saying the cat was black, the Crown will have only one witness saying the cat was black. Declining to enter upon the credibility and reliability of the evidence does not mean ignoring that the credibility or reliability of the evidence of the first witness may be impugned at the trial, or that the evidence of the second witness may support its acceptance or independently be accepted by the jury. 
     
      
    67 This is, in my view, in accordance with this Court’s decision in R v SJRC [2007] NSWCCA 142. Text messages said to corroborate the complainant’s evidence of sexual assault were excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act. James J, with whom Harrison J agreed, adopted at [26]-[27] the “criterion” stated by the Chief Justice in R v Shamouil at [37] for determining whether the prosecution case would be substantially weakened. His Honour noted that the Crown could still rely on the complainant’s evidence. He said - 
     
      
       
        
        “29 However, such a Crown case would depend for its success almost entirely on the jury’s forming a favourable view of the credibility of the complainant. It can be anticipated that at a trial the credibility of the complainant would be attacked, on grounds including the complainant’s obvious hostility to the respondent and what, it would be suggested, is the inherent unlikelihood of the respondent engaging in sexual acts with the complainant in a bathroom in a hospital to which other persons had access.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        30 In my opinion, the two text messages, which occurred only three minutes apart and without any intervening message from the complainant, are clearly open to the interpretation urged by the Crown that the respondent was admitting that on Friday 6 January 2006 sexual acts had occurred between the respondent and the complainant and that the respondent now regretted what he had done. The respondent’s expressed regret is capable of forming part of the basis for an inference that the respondent knew that the complainant had not consented to the sexual acts.  
         
         
        31 In these circumstances, I consider that evidence of the two text messages, is evidence of cogency and force within the criterion in  
        Shamouil 
         and the exclusion of that evidence would “substantially weaken” the prosecution case.” 
        
       
      
    68 Rothman J agreed generally, but at [52]-[56] also considered the range of meanings of “substantially” and said - 
     
      
       
        
        “56 In my view the words “substantially weakens” used in the context of an alternative to “eliminates” must mean that the effect of the evidence must be to weaken the Crown case more than ephemerally or more than nominally. The weakening effect of the exclusion of the evidence must be significant. This will occur when evidence of cogency or force is withheld:  
        R v Shamouil 
          
        [2006] NSWCCA 112, per Spigelman CJ at [37].” 
        
       
      
    69 The evidence in the Crown brief plus the tendency evidence, if accepted by the jury, constitutes a strong Crown case. Without the tendency evidence it would still be strong, but that is not the question: the question is whether it would be substantially weakened. The tendency evidence would quite strongly support that the respondent acted as charged. It is not necessary for present purposes to speak of “substantial probative value”, but without it the Crown case would be weakened, and in my view to an extent satisfying the test of substantial weakening. 
     
      
       
      The approach on appeal 
       
      
    70 Neither s 97(1) nor s 101(2) expresses a discretionary decision, compare ss 135 and 136 of the Evidence Act. Section 97(1) states that tendency evidence is not admissible if “the court thinks” that it would not have significant probative value, with the necessarily evaluative determination of what the court thinks. Section 101(2) does not refer to what the court thinks; the tendency evidence cannot be used against the defendant unless its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. There must nonetheless be evaluation of probative value and prejudicial effect, and omission of reference to what the court thinks may not be particularly important. 
     
      
    71 There can be a fine line between discretion and evaluation. In the different context of whether there had been contempt of court, Spigelman CJ said in Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v X (2000) 49 NSWLR 653 at [33]-[35] - 
     
      
       
        
        “33 As Wilson J said in  
        Hinch 
         at 43:  
         
         
          
          ‘… a decision which is the outcome of the balancing process is not a discretionary judgment. It is the result of an evaluation, consistently with accepted judicial principle, of competing matters of fact.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        34 Furthermore, as Toohey J said in  
        Hinch 
         at 77:  
         
         
          
          ‘There is a balance which the court is called upon to strike. It is not an exercise of discretion; it is an evaluation of competing interests against the background that contempt must be established beyond reasonable doubt.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        35 The task of balancing conflicting public interests involves the making of a judgment by a process of evaluation. It is distinguishable from the making of a finding of fact. It is also distinguishable from the exercise of a discretion, in the sense of a choice between alternative courses of action. Although distinguishable, a process of evaluation will be found, for many jurisprudential purposes, to have a close analogy with fact finding and the exercise of a discretion.” 
        
       
      
    72 See also Perpetual Trustee Company Ltd v Khoshaba [2006] NSWCA 41 at [34]-[40], referring to a value judgment as distinct from the exercise of a discretion. 
     
      
    73 In R v Ellis Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of a five judge bench relevantly agreed, said at [95] - 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 101(2) calls for a balancing exercise which can only be conducted on the facts of each case. It requires the Court to make a judgment, rather than to exercise a discretion. (See  
        R v Blick 
         (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 at [20] per Sheller JA; F Bennion 
          
        “Distinguishing Judgment and Discretion” 
          
        [2000]  
        Public Law 
         368.)” 
        
       
      
    74 In R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 Sheller JA had said of s 137 of the Evidence Act, which also does not express a discretionary decision - 
     
      
       
        
        “19 When an application is made by a defendant pursuant to s137 to exclude evidence, the first thing the judge must undertake is the balancing process of its probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. It is probably correct to say that the product of that process is a judgment of the sort which, in terms of appellate review, is analogous to the exercise of a judicial discretion; see the cases referred to by Priestley JA in  
        Moran v McMahon 
         (1985) 3 NSWLR 700 at 716 and following, particularly  
        Lee Transport Co Limited v Watson 
         (1940) 64 CLR 1 at 13 and  
        Miller v Jennings 
         (1954) 92 CLR 190 at 197. In the second of those cases, Dixon CJ and Kitto J, in an appeal against damages awarded by the trial judge, said of the sum awarded that it was “reached after a very full and careful examination of the facts of the case and it represents an informed judgment upon a matter which must largely be one of opinion and must be governed to a not inconsiderable degree by an estimate formed of the witnesses and in particular the appellant.” Translated to the task set by s137, a trial judge’s estimate of how the probative value should be weighed against the danger of unfair prejudice will be one of opinion based on a variety of circumstances, the evidence, the particulars of the case and the judge’s own trial experience. In that sense, the result can be described as analogous to a discretionary judgment; see Heydon, ‘A Guide to the Evidence Acts’, 2nd ed, para 3.725.  
         
         
        20 Even so, and with due respect, there seems to me to be a risk of error if a judge proceeds on the basis that he or she is being asked to exercise a discretion about whether or not otherwise admissible evidence should be rejected because of unfair prejudice to the defendant. The correct approach is to perform the weighing exercise mandated. If the probative value of the evidence adduced by the prosecutor is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, there is no residual discretion. The evidence must be rejected.” 
        
       
      
    75 It has nonetheless been held that an appeal from a decision to admit or reject tendency evidence attracts the approach of an appeal from a discretionary decision. Sheller JA, with whom James and Dowd JJ agreed, said in R v Blick that the balancing under s 137 was analogous to a discretionary judgment. In R v Fletcher Simpson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed, said - 
     
      
       
        
        “36 A decision to admit or reject evidence tendered under s 97(1) must, obviously, be a decision based upon the information and material available to the judge at the time the decision is made. It is a decision involving “a degree and value judgment” (a phrase drawn from remarks made in the High Court in  
        Fleming v Hutchinson; Conroy v Veit  
        (1991) 66 ALJR 211, when refusing special leave to appeal in an application which otherwise has no bearing upon the present case). Sackville J appears to have taken a similar view in  
        Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd 
         [2000] FCA 1886; 106 FCR 51. Such a decision is reviewable on appeal only on the principles stated in  
        House v The King 
         [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499; see also  
        R v Milton 
         [2004] NSWCCA 195 at [33] and  
        Jacara  
        at [75].” 
        
       
      
    76 In Jacara Pty Ld v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd (2000) 106 FCR 51 Sackville J recorded at [75] the parties’ acceptance that an appellate court’s review of a decision to exclude evidence under s 97(1) is in accordance with the principles applicable to a discretionary judgment. In R v Milton [2004] NSWCCA 195 Hidden J, with whom Tobias JA and Greg James J agreed, referred at [33] to it not being open to the trial judge to have found that the test in s 101(2) was satisfied. In R v Zhang (2005) 158 A Crim R 504 Basten JA observed at [45] that there was a distinction in principle, even if the dividing line was blurred in particular circumstances, between the exercise of a discretionary power and the making of a finding of fact which involves a level of evaluation and judgment, and was inclined to a different view. Simpson J, however, with whom Buddin J agreed, repeated at [141] that appellate review was on the principles in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. 
     
      
    77 Reference should be made to R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52, in which it was said at [38] that the balancing under s 137 of the Evidence Act was akin to the exercise of a discretion because it was the exercise of judgment, but not “in the sense that, if the exercise is not performed in accordance with the section, it cannot be undertaken by an appellate court”. This is, with respect, a little obscure. In relation to s 90 of the Evidence Act the question of discretion or evaluation has been agitated, without binding result, in Em v The Queen [2007] HCA 46, see at [55], [182], [198]-[199]. The last word may not have been written.  
     
      
    78 However, the Crown accepted that the principles in House v The King governed its appeal, and there is no present occasion to question that position. In House v The King Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ said at 504-5 - 
     
      
       
        
        “The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles. It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance.” 
         
        
       
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    79 The Crown submitted that, in holding that the probative value of the evidence did not substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect that it would have, the judge failed properly to consider in what particular respect or respects the evidence sought to be adduced by the Crown might be used by the jury in some unfair way, and accordingly failed properly to consider what prejudicial effect it might have upon the respondent. It relied in this respect on the observations by McHugh J in Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at [91]. His Honour there said that evidence is not unfairly prejudicial merely because it makes it more likely that the defendant will be convicted, and (by citation from R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 139) that there must be prejudice which is unfair because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way. 
     
      
    80 The Crown further submitted that the judge failed properly to take into account his power to give appropriate directions or to consider whether any such direction should be given, as a relevant matter in the balancing exercise required by s 101(2) of the Evidence Act. The Crown referred to R v Carusi (1997) 92 A Crim R 52 at 55-6, R v Cook at [37], and R v Ngatikaura [2006] NSWCCA 161 at [32]. It relied particularly on R v RN [2005] NSWCCA 413 at [14], where Sully J (with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed) said of the balancing exercise that, even when there is risk of prejudice to the defendant such as to justify excluding the evidence, “the exclusion of the evidence is not the only just way of dealing with any perceived prejudice: adequate direction by the judge to the jury is an example of a possibly appropriate alternative in a particular case”.  
     
      
    81 The respondent’s submissions questioned the probative value of the tendency evidence. He submitted that, apart from the “simplistic similarity” of being sexual offences involving young girls, there were many differences between the offences charged and the 1987 and 1995-6 offences involving JC and AR respectively and no particular pattern in the sexual misconduct.  
     
      
    82 The judge’s analysis of the similarities and dissimilarities between the evidence of the offences charged against the respondent and the tendency evidence showed sexual misconduct other than in the ways set out in the Crown’s tendency notice, and any tendency to act in those ways was accompanied by more generally engaging in sexual misconduct. Harking back to earlier in these reasons, the May 1996 incident involving JC could bear upon the admissibility of the tendency evidence so far as it suggested general sexual misconduct rather than the more particular misconduct. However, there is no occasion to depart from the judge’s finding of substantial probative value. The judge correctly said at [54] that the tendency evidence was not overwhelming, and at [55] that the similarities were not as “compelling” and the evidence was not “in the same category” as in other cases to which he referred. The Crown’s difficulty in the appeal is that the judge did not err in the respects for which the Crown contended. 
     
      
    83 The judge considered how the tendency evidence might be used by the jury in an unfair way. He directed himself that he must consider the prejudice in the particular case, and did so. The unfair use was that the jury might reason no more rationally than that, if the respondent molested JC and AR, he did the same to the complainant, and that emotion not rationality would govern and “the issue of credibility” might be ignored (at [50]-[51]). The judge did not use the language of use in an unfair way, but the prejudice he identified was of that kind. 
     
      
    84 The prejudice was, as the respondent pointed out, similar to that identified in R v Watkins (2005) 153 A Crim R 434, where Barr J (with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed) said - 
     
      
       
        
        “49 It seems to me that the difficulty about the evidence was the risk to which it gave rise that the jury would be overwhelmed by the knowledge that the appellant had been convicted of a series of frauds on a previous employer and would refuse to contemplate the appellant’s defence to the charges before them, which were of a similar nature. His Honour recognised such a risk during a debate with counsel on 12 May 2004 when he said this -  
         
         
          
          It gives rise to prejudgment. What do you say to the proposition that in this case that as a possibility, a jury might hypothetically, as soon as they learn about the 1984 matter, fold their arms and say ‘oh well we might as well rack the cue here, he’s obviously guilty, we won’t listen to any more evidence, it’s all over, he’s done it before, he must have done it this time’, why wouldn’t they possibly take that approach? 
           
          
         
        50 It seems to me that there was a real danger that the jury’s recognition of the appellant’s prior guilt was likely to divert them from a proper consideration of the evidence as bearing on the question of his intent in the charges before them. The difficulty of obviating that risk had to be taken into account in assessing the likely prejudicial effect of the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    85 The judge had regard to directions to the jury as an available course. He said that the jury might reason in the manner last mentioned “[n]otwithstanding the warnings that a trial judge must give” (at [50]). He said that the jury would be told not to punish the respondent again by basing their verdict on emotional rather than rational considerations, but no matter how many times the jury was told to be rational and dispassionate it was “in the trial of a self-confessed child molester … a big ask” (at [50]-[51]). In his Honour’s view “[t]he potential for very great prejudice remains regardless of what could be said by the trial judge to ameliorate it” (at [51]). 
     
      
    86 The Crown submitted that the judge did not consider the “standard” directions or any particular directions which could be given. There is no reason to think his Honour failed to turn his mind to possible directions. He was of the view that there was prejudicial effect no matter what directions were given.  
     
      
    87 The Crown further submitted that the judge was in error in not proceeding on the assumption that, if appropriate directions were given, the jury would act in accordance with the directions. It referred to McHugh J’s emphasis in Gilbert v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [31]-[32] that the fundamental assumption of a criminal trial is that the jury acts on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge. Prejudicial effect, however, is to be evaluated without such a foreclosing assumption, and his Honour’s remarks were not directed to the present situation. 
     
      
    88 The judge did in his reasons refer to use which might be made of the earlier guilty pleas to the advantage of the respondent. There was a suggestion in the Crown’s submissions that the judge’s consideration was wrongly diverted to whether the respondent might be able to use the tendency evidence in that way. It may be that, in balancing probative value and prejudicial effect, possible probative value in favour of the accused is not material. But the judge did not weigh this in the balance adversely to the Crown, and it was not a matter which contributed to his conclusion that the scales were not tipped substantially in favour of probative value. 
     
      
    89 It was well open to the judge to see a real risk of unfair misuse of the tendency evidence, and to conclude that directions could not be given which would satisfactorily prevent it. Treating his ruling as the exercise of a discretion, error in the respects for which the Crown contended has not been shown. For completeness, as an evaluative judgment it is one which was open to the judge and which I would not displace on appeal.

     I agree with Tobias JA.

     TOBIAS JA 
     : On 30 June 2005 the opponent commenced proceedings in the District Court of New South Wales against the claimant seeking damages arising out of injuries sustained by him on 27 March 2003 whilst negotiating an area of the claimant’s premises where there were three sets of slipway rails. His left foot struck one of the rails causing him to fall and sustain injuries to his head and left wrist.  
      
       
      
     3 The proceedings were heard by his Honour Judge McLoughlin who, in a judgment delivered on 31 January 2007, found that the opponent’s injuries had been caused by the negligence of the claimant. His Honour therefore entered a verdict and judgment in favour of the opponent in the sum of $28,487.36 together with costs, part of which were ordered on an indemnity basis. From that decision the claimant seeks leave to appeal to this Court, the application for leave and the substantive appeal having being heard concurrently.  
      
       
      
     4 At the end of the oral argument the Court determined to grant the claimant leave to appeal notwithstanding that the amount in issue was well below the threshold of $100,000. Appeals against monetary awards which fall significantly below the threshold are not to be encouraged. Nevertheless it was appropriate that leave be granted in the present case as the Court had come firmly to the view that the primary judge’s decision was erroneous. In other words, had the Court been of the view that his Honour’s decision was only arguably wrong, then the relatively small amount in issue would in all probability have been given determinative weight in refusing leave to appeal. It is only because the Court has come to the conclusion that his Honour’s decision is clearly wrong that leave was granted. That being so, I shall hereafter refer to the parties as appellant and respondent.  
      
       
        
       The relevant facts.  
        
       
      
     5 At the time of the incident in question, the respondent was 75 years old and in good health. He had been a member of the appellant for 10 years and was an avid fisherman during that period. During the summer months he would go fishing at least twice a week. He transported his boat by trailer attached to his motor vehicle to and from the appellant’s premises. He would launch the boat from the ramp adjoining the appellant’s carpark.  
      
       
      
     6 The launching ramp was bounded by a wire fence which had a double gate that was kept unlocked and through which access could be gained to the appellant’s clubhouse across a concrete apron upon which were laid three parallel sets of slip rails leading to the water and upon which were moveable cradles on which boats could be slipped for repairs and maintenance (the slipway). Taking a line direct from the gates across the slip rails to the opposite side, the concrete apron was relatively flat, the rails themselves standing approximately 150-200mm proud of the apron to which they were attached. On the far side of the slipway was an ice room and a room where the members’ catch could be weighed.  
      
       
      
     7 On the day in question the respondent arrived at the appellant’s premises at approximately 5.30am when it was still dark. He parked his car and trailer and then set about preparing for the morning’s fishing. He proceeded through the slipway gates and across the three sets of slip rails to the ice room where he collected approximately 15 kilos of ice in a 20 kilo capacity bucket. His intention was then to return to his car. Having safely negotiated on his return journey two of the three sets of slip rails, his left foot hit the first of the third set of rails causing him to fall and strike his head on the second rail of that set.  
      
       
      
     8 In chief the respondent said that he was looking down at the rails as he stepped over them but that he could not see them because it was dark and they were, in any event, rusted and black. 
      
       
      
     9 Although it was the respondent’s case at trial that there was no lighting or illumination of the rails which he had to negotiate when proceeding to and from the ice room, the primary judge found (and his finding was not challenged) that the respondent was mistaken in relation to the state of lighting at the time of his fall and that the appellant had provided adequate lighting of the area where the slip rails were located and which was illuminated at the time of the respondent’s accident.  
      
       
        
       The decision of the primary judge 
        
       
      
     10 The respondent pleaded the following particulars of negligence on the part of the appellant: 
      
       
        
       (a) Failure to provide adequate lighting to the area in circumstances where it was well known to the appellant that its members would regularly attend in darkness to prepare for a fishing trip. 
        
        
       (b) Failure to provide a raised access ramp across the slip rails for persons such as the respondent so as to provide a level surface for those persons to walk upon. 
        
        
       (c) Failure to define the height of the slip rails by painting them with phosphorescent paint. 
        
       
      
     11 The primary judge made the following findings: 
      
       
        
       (a) Many members of the appellant frequently accessed the ice room in the same manner as the respondent had, that is, by traversing across the slipway to the ice room, obtaining ice and then returning to their car or boat;  
        
        
       (b) As at 27 March 2003 there were two lights that directly illuminated the slipway area; those lights were controlled by light sensors from a sunset switch so that they came on at dusk and remained on as long as it was dark; 
        
        
       (c) At the time of the respondent’s accident it was still dark but the slipway area was illuminated by two lights, one of which pointed down the passageway to the ice room and the other of which shone directly onto the slipway; 
        
        
       (d) Over many years, to the appellant’s knowledge, its members, during hours of darkness, had traversed the slipway for the purpose of obtaining ice from the ice room to put in their boats before going fishing and that this was a practice which was accepted by the appellant without any warning that the ice room should not be accessed in this manner; 
        
        
       (e) Although there was an alternative way of accessing the ice room that did not involve negotiating the slipway, this was not frequently used and many members adopted the same modus operandi as the respondent had in accessing the ice room by walking across the slipway; 
        
        
       (f) Although the respondent fell in the manner he described, his Honour rejected his evidence that the lighting in the area was deficient; 
        
        
       (g) Although the appellant was aware that there was some danger in permitting its members to traverse the area of the slipway, it nevertheless allowed club members to access the ice room both during the day and at night in the manner adopted by the respondent; 
        
        
       (h) That danger could have been removed by the installation of a concrete ramp leading up to and across each set of slip rails, which would have permitted the three sets of rails to be traversed without each rail having to be negotiated by stepping over it, and by painting the rails yellow; 
        
        
       (i) The respondent fell because of the dangerous condition of the slipway over which he and other members traversed for the purpose of gaining access to and from the ice room and on the occasion in question the respondent misjudged the height of the slip rails as he carried a large amount of ice in his bucket when returning to his boat; 
        
        
       (j) In February 2004 when the appellant’s premises were being reconstructed and/or renovated, a concrete ramp to enable the slip rails to be traversed without stepping over each one was installed and the rails, where they passed through the concrete apron, were painted yellow: the evidence did not establish that this work was carried out as a consequence of the accident that befell the respondent.  
        
       
      
     12 The primary judge found that as there was access to the ice room via the slipway, the appellant owed the respondent a duty to take reasonable care for his safety. As the appellant had pleaded ss 5F and 5G of the  
     Civil Liability Act 2002  
     (the  
     Act 
     ), his Honour also found that given the description of the slipway, the risk of bumping into or tripping over a slip rail was one which was obvious within the meaning of s 5F and that the respondent was aware of that risk. However, his Honour continued: 
      
       
        
         
         “This is not a warning case and the risk to which I have referred could easily have been removed by the use of the concrete ramping and yellow illuminating paint replacing the dark bold rusty finish that was in existence at the time of the [respondent’s] fall.” 
         
        
       
      
     13 His Honour then found that the respondent had successfully navigated the slip rails on his path to obtain the ice at a time when he was unhindered by the weight of ice. Bearing in mind his age, on his return journey he was then carrying 15 kilos of ice. Accordingly, whilst accepting there was no direct evidence on the point, he accepted  
      
       
        
         
         “that the [respondent] in his desire to have the ice on his boat and launch his boat, momentarily overlooked the difficulty in traversing the slipway rails on his return journey, because of his age, he was then seventy-seven and carrying a very heavy bucket of ice. Relying on the basis that the [respondent] successfully negotiated the railings without the burden of the weight of ice and failed to do so with the weight of ice, I am of the view that on probabilities, the [respondent] was unaware that carrying the ice would make it more difficult for him to traverse the railings upon which he fell. It follows that I am of the view that the presumption of awareness of the relevant risk has been rebutted because of that to which I have referred.” 
         
        
       
      
     14 As to the three particulars of negligence referred to in [10] above, his Honour found for the appellant with respect to particular (a) and for the respondent with respect to particulars (b) and (c) in that the appellant 
      
       
        
         
         “did fail to provide a raised access ramp for persons such as the [respondent] to provide a level surface for a person to walk on and failed to define the height of the slipway rails by painting them with phosphorescent paint. I accept, as I have indicated, that the [respondent] recognised the risk of injury as he traversed the rails hindered (sic) by weight and his age but failed to recognise the difficulties of further traversing the rails burdened by the weight of up to 20 kilograms being carried by a man of his age. Accordingly, he is entitled to a verdict.” 
         
        
        
       The grounds of appeal 
        
       
      
     15 The grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant were as follows: 
      
       
        
       (a) The primary judge erred by denying the appellant procedural fairness: 
        
        
         
         (i) in making findings in relation to a case that was not presented by the respondent at trial; 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) in not requiring submissions to be made on the issues he decided in the respondent’s favour; 
         
        
        
       (b) The primary judge failed to provide adequate reasons in relation to the “ 
       balancing 
       ” required in accordance with  
       Wyong Shire Council v Shirt  
       (1980) 146 CLR 40 and further erred by failing to give adequate reasons as to the “ 
       dominant 
       ” consideration in determining whether the appellant had breached his duty of care to the respondent, namely, the obviousness of the risk confronting the respondent. 
        
       
      
     16 The first ground of appeal was founded upon the manner in which the respondent conducted his case at trial, namely, that the real issue was whether the respondent’s case that the slipway area where he fell was dark and not illuminated should be accepted. His Honour acknowledged that this was the principal area of dispute between the parties. Reliance was therefore placed, inter alia, upon the respondent’s written submissions to the primary judge where it was stated that  
      
       
        
         
         “the risk of harm in this case, in respect of which a reasonable response must be judged, was the risk of injury to a person most likely elderly … traversing the slipway area in darkness, perhaps while carrying ice and tripping on the slipway rails.” 
         
        
       
      
     17 It was submitted that the respondent’s case was simply put, namely, it was dark; he was looking where he was going; he could not see the slip rails in front of him; he felt his left foot strike a rail and he fell. The breach of duty relied upon was the alleged failure to light the area. It was further submitted that the respondent did not derogate at trial from this assertion either in his evidence or in his submissions. 
      
       
      
     18 The primary judge found that the fact that the respondent was unaware that carrying 15-20 kilos of ice would make it more difficult, given his age, for him to traverse the slip rails upon which he fell, rendered the relevant risk of tripping over a slip rail (even though it was illuminated) one which at least so far as he was concerned, was no longer obvious: in other words, it was no longer a risk which was obvious and therefore was not one of which he was or could be aware. However, this was not the case made at trial as a consequence whereof there was no cross-examination of the respondent relevant to it. In fact, his evidence was said to be to the contrary as appears from the following exchange: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. When filling your bucket with ice, it was a 15 or 20 kilogram bucket wasn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you’d fill it with 15 or 20 kilograms of ice wouldn’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Around 15, 15 kilogram. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And as at 27 March 2003 you’d agree that was a cumbersome item to carry? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, 15 kilo is nothing.” 
         
        
       
      
     19 As to the second ground of appeal, the appellant submitted that in finding that the respondent was “ 
     unaware 
     ” in the circumstances of the obvious risk constituted by the slip rails, the primary judge failed to adequately deal with the issue as to whether a person in the respondent’s position exercising reasonable care for his own safety should have been aware of the risk of injury in traversing the slipway.  
      
       
      
     20 It is unnecessary to express a view on those grounds of appeal alleging denial of procedural fairness or inadequacy of reasons. This is because they do not, in truth, encapsulate the real flaw in the primary judge’s reasoning. Thus it was accepted in the course of the respondent’s submissions that it was necessary for his Honour to have identified the risk of harm to which the appellant was allegedly exposed and then to determine in accordance with the balancing principle spoken of in  
     Shirt 
     , the reasonable response of the respondent to that risk. The respondent advanced its oral submissions on the appeal on this basis.  
      
       
      
     21 Having found that the appellant had provided adequate lighting of the slipway area but had failed to provide an access ramp over the slip rails for persons such as the respondent to traverse on their way to and from the ice room, and to define the height of the slip rails by painting them with phosphorescent paint, his Honour concluded that the appellant had been negligent in circumstances where the respondent had failed to recognise the difficulties of traversing the slip rails whilst carrying up to 20 kilograms of ice at his age. With respect, this reasoning is difficult to follow and is erroneous. This is because the primary judge asked himself the wrong question. In particular, having accepted that there was a duty upon the appellant to take reasonable care for the safety of the respondent given its knowledge that its elderly members traversed the three sets of slip rails in order to access the ice room so that it was reasonably foreseeable that such persons might trip over one of the exposed slip rails, his Honour failed to determine the reasonable response of a person in the position of the appellant to that risk.  
      
       
      
     22 The primary judge’s reasoning process appears to have been as follows: 
      
       
        
       (a) The appellant owed the respondent a duty to take reasonable care for his safety in traversing, whether by day or night, the slipway in order to gain access to the ice room; 
        
        
       (b) The appellant had provided adequate lighting to that area; 
        
        
       (c) Nevertheless, it had failed to provide a raised access ramp over the slip rails so as to provide a level surface to those of its members who wished to traverse the slipway in order to gain access to the ice room; 
        
        
       (d) The respondent failed to recognise the difficulty of traversing the slip rails burdened by the weight of up to 20 kilograms of ice given his advanced years; 
        
        
       (e) Although he was taking reasonable care for his own safety, the respondent inadvertently, no doubt as a consequence of his failure to recognise the difficulties referred to in the preceding subparagraph, tripped on a slip rail causing him to fall and sustain injury. 
        
       (f) Therefore the appellant was in breach of its duty of care to the respondent. 
       
      
     23 His Honour’s process of reasoning which I have attempted to articulate is, with respect, in error. First, it fails to recognise, that the appellant did not owe a duty of care to its members to ensure that no harm befell them when traversing the slipway area but only a duty to take  
     reasonable  
     care. Second, the relevant enquiry is prospective and not retrospective. It is wrong to focus exclusively upon the particular way in which the accident came about. As Hayne J observed in  
     Vairy v Wyong Shire Council  
     [2005] HCA 62, (2005) 223 CLR 422 at 461 [124], the examination of the causes of an accident that  
     has  
     happened cannot be equated with the examination that is to be undertaken when asking whether there was a breach of a duty of care which was a cause of the plaintiff’s injuries. The enquiry into the causes of an accident is wholly retrospective. The enquiry into breach, although made after the accident, must attempt to answer what response a reasonable person, confronted with a foreseeable risk of injury, would have made to that risk. One of the possible answers to that enquiry must be “ 
     nothing 
     ”.  
      
       
      
     24 Although dissenting in the result in  
     Vairy 
     , McHugh J (at 433 [28]) observed that although there were a range of factors that determined when the common law will impose on a defendant a duty to take reasonable care for the safety of a plaintiff, there are no factors other than the  
     Shirt  
     formula by which the common law defines the standard of reasonable care required in a particular case. The difficulty in the present case is that the primary judge did not purport to apply that formula.  
      
       
      
     25 As was pointed out by Gummow J in  
     Roads & Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer  
     [2007] HCA 42, (2007) 238 ALR 761 at 778 [59], it was necessary for the primary judge to accurately identify the actual risk of injury to which the respondent was exposed. It is only through the correct identification of that risk that one can assess what a reasonable response to that risk would be. In the present case, the relevant risk was that an elderly member of the appellant, carrying his fishing gear including ice, might misjudge the position or height of one of the slipway rails and thus trip, fall and suffer injury.  
      
       
      
     26 No doubt one of the responses by which that risk could be eliminated in discharge of the appellant’s duty of care would be to provide a level surface across that section of the slipway used as a walkway to the ice room. But  
     Shirt  
     is not authority for the proposition that there is necessarily a breach of duty if the risk of injury is reasonably foreseeable and removal of that risk by the adoption of simple and cheap measures is practicable but not undertaken. As Heydon JA, with whom Meagher JA and Foster AJA agreed, observed in  
     Van Der Sluice v Display Craft Pty Ltd  
     [2002] NSWCA 204 at [83], such a reading of  
     Shirt  
     would be fallacious as the proposition that the suggested measures 
      
       
        
         
         “would have been a cheap and practical response to the foreseeable risk begs the question of whether it was necessary for the defendant to embark on that response … Mason J [in  
         Shirt 
         ] left open as the response of a reasonable person the course of doing nothing instead of adopting the simple and cheap measures.” 
         
        
       
      
     27 A similar point was made by Hayne J in  
     Brodie v Singleton Shire Council  
     [2001] HCA 29; (2001) 206 CLR 512 at 631 [318] where he observed: 
      
       
        
         
         “As I have said, however, the search for some unifying principle or principles which will explain why an analogy has been drawn with previous authority in some cases but not others has so far proved unsuccessful. All that emerges is that foresight of harm, and capacity to avoid it, has been said not to be enough. Something more’ must be found. If, however, the expansion of duty of care continues on its current path, foresight of harm and capacity to avoid it will become the only criteria which underpin the imposition of a duty of care. In that event, duty of care would serve no purpose in identifying the cases in which liability is to be found. The only questions would be whether a defendant in fact acted without reasonable care, or failed to act when it would be reasonable to do so, and whether that act or omission was a cause of the plaintiff’s loss or damage.” 
         
        
       
      
     28 The factors to be taken into account when applying the  
     Shirt  
     principle are well known. They include a consideration of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of the probability of its occurrence. In the present case it could be fairly said that the magnitude of the risk was neither high nor low in that a person tripping on a slip rail and falling was likely to sustain some injury to himself or herself but not necessarily one that was catastrophic. On the other hand, the probability of its occurrence in the present case was low given that the evidence was that there had been no similar incident in the memory of those who gave evidence. One witness called on behalf of the respondent, a Mr Nicolettos, stated in cross-examination that on one occasion he had fallen over but had only incurred a couple of scratches and had not told anyone about the incident. When it was suggested to him that each and every time he walked across the slipway in his 10 years of membership he knew he had to be careful to avoid falling over or tripping on something such as a slip rail, he response was: “ 
     Yes, of course, it’s like walking... 
     ”. 
      
       
      
     29 The present is not a case where the appellant’s response to the foreseeable risk which I have identified was one of “ 
     do nothing 
     ”. It provided illumination of the relevant slipway area which his Honour found was in place and operational at the time of the respondent’s accident. Accordingly, the situation at night was the same as in daylight in that the slip rails were illuminated and clearly visible to those members of the appellant who traversed the slipway area for the purpose of accessing the ice room.  
      
       
      
     30 As his Honour found, the risk of bumping into a slip rail was one which was obvious within the meaning of s 5F of the  
     Act 
     . As I understand that finding, it was that the relevant risk was obvious both to the appellant and to the respondent.  
      
       
      
     31 Obviousness to the respondent was irrelevant other than for the purposes of s 5G of the Act or on the issue of contributory negligence. Obviousness to the appellant, however, was of relevance in considering the probability of occurrence of the risk in question for the purposes of applying the  
     Shirt  
     formula. Thus in  
     Vairy  
     at 470 [163], Hayne J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The probability of occurrence of a risk that is not apparent on casual observation of the locality or of a set or circumstances may be higher than the probability of occurrence of a risk that is readily apparent to even the casual observer. But the focus of enquiry must remain upon the putative tortfeasor, not upon the person who has been injured, and not upon others who may avoid injury.” 
         
        
       
      
     32 Obviousness of risk was also referred to in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ in  
     Thompson v Woolworths (Queensland) Pty Ltd  
     [2005] HCA 19, (2005) 221 CLR 234 at 246-247 where the following was said: 
      
       
        
         
          
         “[36] The obviousness of a risk, and the remoteness of the likelihood that other people will fail to observe and avoid it, are often factors relevant to a judgment about what reasonableness requires as a response. In the case of some risks, reasonableness may require no response. There are, for instance, no risk-free dwelling houses. The community's standards of reasonable behaviour do not require householders to eliminate all risks from their premises, or to place a notice at the front door warning entrants of all the dangers that await them if they fail to take care for their own safety. This is not a case about warnings. Even so, it may be noted that a conclusion, in a given case, that a warning is either necessary or sufficient, itself involves an assumption that those to whom the warning is addressed will take notice of it and will exercise care. The whole idea of warnings is that those who receive them will act carefully. There would be no purpose in issuing warnings unless it were reasonable to expect that people will modify their behaviour in response to warnings.  
         
        
       
       
        
         
         [37] The factual judgment involved in a decision about what is reasonably to be expected of a person who owes a duty of care to another involves an interplay of considerations. The weight to be given to any one of them is likely to vary according to circumstances. If the obviousness of a risk, and the reasonableness of an expectation that other people will take care for their own safety, were conclusive against liability in every case, there would be little room for a doctrine of contributory negligence. On the other hand, if those considerations were irrelevant, community standards of reasonable behaviour would require radical alteration.” 
         
        
       
      
     33 The fact that the appellant, in circumstances unrelated to the respondent’s accident, subsequently adopted a course which the respondent now says it should have adopted at an earlier point of time, does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that in the circumstances it was unreasonable for the appellant not to have adopted that course in order to eliminate the relevant risk. The response to that risk must be one which is reasonable in all the circumstances at a point of time immediately prior to the accident that gives rise to the inquiry.  
      
       
      
     34 The duty imposed upon the appellant was no more and no less than one of reasonable care. Given that the determination of breach of duty must be one which is determined prospectively and not retrospectively without the benefit of hindsight, in my opinion the exercise of reasonable care did not require the appellant to take any steps to eliminate the relevant risk other that which it had already taken, namely, to ensure that the relevant area of the slipway was fully illuminated at night.  
      
       
      
     35 It follows from the foregoing that in my view the primary judge erred in failing to apply the  
     Shirt  
     formula in order to determine whether the appellant was in breach of its duty of care to the respondent. Had he done so, he ought to have concluded that the failure of the appellant to provide an access ramp across the slip rails in order to provide a level surface for persons such the respondent to traverse and/or its failure to define the height of the slip rails by painting them with phosphorescent paint, given that the rails were clearly visible both during the daytime and at night, did not constitute a breach of that duty. 
      
       
      
     36 For completeness I would add the following observation. The respondent said that he was looking down at the slip rails and that carrying 15 kilos of ice was not cumbersome. The primary judge found that the area where the slip rails were located was illuminated and that the respondent’s tripping over one of the rails was inadvertent. In these circumstances causation was at least questionable. However, it is unnecessary to express a concluded view on that issue. 
      
      
       
       Conclusion 
        
       
      
     37 In my opinion the primary judge erred in finding that the appellant had breached its duty of care to the respondent. His Honour’s reasoning process was flawed but even if he had applied the  
     Shirt  
     formula as he clearly was obliged to do, then he ought to have found that no further response was reasonably required by the appellant to the potential risk associated with its members of the appellant traversing the slipway area in the manner adopted by the respondent.  
      
       
      
     38 Accordingly, I would propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       (a) Appeal allowed. 
        
        
       (b) Set aside the orders made by his Honour Judge McLaughlin on 31 January 2007 and in lieu thereof enter a judgment and verdict for the appellant. 
        
        
       (c) The respondent to pay the appellant’s costs of the proceedings in the District Court and of the summons for leave to appeal and the appeal but to have with respect to the latter a certificate under the  
       Suitor’s Fund Act 1951 
       , 
         
       if otherwise qualified. 
        
       
      
     39  
     HANDLEY AJA 
     : The relevant facts, and the history of the proceedings, have been set out by Tobias JA. I agree that leave to appeal should be granted despite the modest amount of the judgment and that the appeal should be allowed. 
      
       
      
     40 The respondent was familiar with the area having used it for about ten years. Rails are a normal feature of boatsheds. The area was well lit, the rails were obvious, and the respondent had crossed the rails safely on his way to get the ice and two of the three sets on his way back. The load of ice had not been a problem with the first two sets of rails and the respondent said that it was not a problem anyway.  
      
       
      
     41 The inescapable conclusion is that the respondent's action was caused by his inattention, or lack of care for his own safety. It is always possible after an accident to point to some further precaution that could have been taken that would or might have reduced the risk but that is not sufficient to establish negligence. 
      
       
      
     42 The steps that a defendant should have taken to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury must be considered prospectively and not retrospectively. The known use of this area by members and others in the hours of darkness created an obvious risk of injury but there was no evidence of any problems during daylight. The provision of strong illumination during the hours of darkness was a reasonable response and, as far as the club was concerned, there had been no problem for 10 years. Another member had tripped without suffering any significant injury but had not bothered to report the matter to the club. 
      
       
      
     43 The club had performed its duty to exercise reasonable care and was not required to do anything more.

     Judgment 
    On 28 August 1993 the Applicant’s mother, father and brother were stabbed to death. The Applicant was charged with the murder of his brother. The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter of his brother. The plea was accepted in full discharge of the indictment for murder on the basis that the Applicant killed his brother as a result of provocation resulting from the fact that his brother had killed their parents.Between 1993 and 2004 the Coroner held two inquests into the deaths of the Applicant’s parents, the second following another police investigation into the matter which had resulted in a referral to the Coroner. In 2000, at the end of this second inquest the Coroner, in effect, concluded the accused should stand trial for the murder of his parents. However, the Director of Public Prosecutions notified the Applicant that he declined to prosecute him, on the basis that there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction. A private prosecution commenced by the Applicant’s uncle was taken over by the Director and terminated.In July 2004 a review of the investigations into the killings was undertaken and in October 2004 a re-investigation was commenced into the killing of the Applicant’s parents. A brief of evidence was sent to the Director on 22 November 2005. On 21 February 2006 the Director filed an ex-officio indictment, charging the Applicant with the murder of his parents, which is the subject of these proceedings.The pleas of autrefois convict and autrefois acquit were not available because the Applicant had not previously been charged with murder of his parents. However, the Applicant sought a stay of proceedings on the basis that the prosecution constituted an abuse of process, contravening the principles of finality of litigation, incontrovertibility of decisions and “double jeopardy” in the sense embodied in the maxim bis vexari (no one should twice be vexed for one and the same cause). Howie J gave judgment against the Applicant.Held (granting leave but dismissing the appeal):The principle of incontrovertibility of an acquittal (per McClellan CJ at CL, Hidden J and Latham J agreeing)1. The incontrovertibility principle will be engaged where the prosecution seeks to establish at a later trial one or more of the elements necessary to establish the earlier offence.

     (per Spigelman CJ)2. The test for incontrovertibility is whether a subsequent prosecution is manifestly inconsistent with a previous acquittal when the elements of the new charge are compared with the issues in the first trial. The principle does not extend to anything which may ‘call into question’ or ‘tend to undermine’ a previous acquittal.

    A. Was the Applicant acquitted?(per McClellan CJ at CL, Hulme J, Hidden J and Latham J agreeing)1. The Applicant was acquitted of the murder of his brother. It does not follow from the fact that the prosecutor led no evidence on the charge of murder that the accused did not have the benefit of a verdict of acquittal.

    R v Naraindeen (1990) 75 CR (2d) 120 referred to.(per Spigelman CJ, Hulme J agreeing)2. The acceptance of a plea of guilty to a charge of manslaughter involves an acquittal of the charge of murder. Even if no formal acquittal for the murder of the brother was recorded, the Applicant was entitled to such an order. [46], [247]Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501 applied. R v Maxwell (1994) 34 NSWLR 606 approved.R v Naraindeen (1990) 75 CR (2d) 120 referred to.B. Is the current prosecution inconsistent with the Applicant’s acquittal? (per McClellan CJ at CL, Hidden J and Latham J agreeing)1. The acquittal of murder of the parents could not be reconciled with his acquittal for murder of the brother. [157](per Spigelman CJ)2. The current prosecution is manifestly inconsistent in the sense outlined by Carroll. [31], [54]The Queen v Carroll (2002) 213 CLR 635 applied.

       (2006) 226 CLR 328 cited. 
      
    C. Was the Applicant in jeopardy?(per McClellan CJ at CL, Hulme J, Hidden J and Latham J agreeing)1. When murder is charged a plea to the lesser charge will result in a conviction for manslaughter and the accused must be in jeopardy for manslaughter. Given the conviction for manslaughter will involve an acquittal on the murder charge, and that a plea of autrefois acquit to murder would be available, the accused must also have been in jeopardy on the charge of murder.

    2. The Applicant’s trial commenced when he was arraigned; as a result he was relevantly in jeopardy of the murder charge. [176], [237], [274], [275]R v Nicolaidis (1994) 33 NSWLR 364 applied. 3. There was no defect in the indictment. It was not suggested that the evidence available to the prosecution could not, as a matter of law, support a conviction. The Crown only conceded that the quality of evidence available would not enable a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant was not provoked by his brother’s conduct in killing their parents. The Applicant was in jeopardy on the murder charge [196], [197], [237], [274], [275]

    (per Hulme J)4. It is of no significance that the Applicant’s acquittal on the murder charge and conviction on the manslaughter charge occurred in the circumstances they did, rather than after jury verdict following a fully contested trial. [249]5. The distinction between evidence that would not enable a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant was not provoked and evidence that could not as a matter of law support a conviction is not a valid one. The law is not that where a case ends with a verdict by direction because the evidence could not support a conviction the accused was never in jeopardy. [239], [242], [246]

    (per Spigelman CJ, dissenting)6. Because the Applicant’s plea was accepted in full discharge of the indictment for murder prior to the empanelment of the jury, the Applicant was not relevantly in jeopardy. The point of arraignment is not the substantive commencement for purposes of the principles of incontrovertibility, finality and double jeopardy The Appellant was not in jeopardy.

    7. This was a case where the Crown accepted the plea of manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment for murder because it could not contradict the Applicant’s case of provocation on the available evidence. In such a case there has been no acquittal on the merits. The Appellant was not in jeopardy. [87], [93], [96]

    (per Spigelman CJ)2. The values underlying the principles of finality, incontrovertibility and bis vexari, as applied in the authorities to previous acquittals, should be extended to previous convictions. [108], [110], [111]

    3. When considering whether proceedings that may cast doubt on a conviction constitute an abuse of process which justifies a permanent stay, an analogous approach to that identified in Carroll is appropriate. It is necessary to identify whether there is a “manifest inconsistency” between the prior conviction and the new proceedings. [112]A. Is the current prosecution inconsistent with the incontrovertibility of the Applicant’s conviction?(per McClellan CJ at CL, Hulme J, Hidden J and Latham J agreeing)1. This is a case where later proceedings will tend to undermine the integrity of the previous verdict. The verdict of guilty of murder of the parents would demonstrate the original verdict of manslaughter, and the lenient sentence given, were based on a false premise and tend to indicate that the Applicant was guilty of murdering his brother. [201], [237], [274], [275] (per Spigelman CJ)2. The doubt cast upon the previous conviction is only incidental and does not infringe the values underlying the applicable principles. [112], [113]The Queen v Carroll (2002) 213 CLR 635 applied.Abuse of Process(per McClellan CJ at CL, Hidden J and Latham J agreeing)1. With respect to both the acquittal and conviction, a conviction for the murder of the parents would raise an inconsistency between the verdicts of the kind the incontrovertibility principle seeks to avoid. It is not significant that the earlier verdicts were more favourable to the Applicant. This inconsistency weighs in favour of this Court intervening. [219], [274], [275]

       (1998) 194 CLR 610 referred to.  
      
    2. The need to provide the accused with the full benefit of an earlier acquittal, which would mean the Applicant could not be convicted of killing his parents, is an additional factor in favour of intervention by this Court. [220], [274], [275]3. Despite these factors, this case does not involve an abuse process requiring this Court’s intervention. The concern regarding inconsistency is significantly diminished where, as here, the assertions made by the accused in the earlier proceedings have not been tested and where the new prosecution is for a different offence. The public interest in prosecuting serious crimes must prevail. [222], [223] [274], [275](per Hulme J)4. An approach which focuses on whether an abuse of process has occurred is preferable to one which tries to identify exactly how a prosecution may controvert a previous verdict. Although the current charges may involve a “scandal of conflicting decisions”, it would be a far greater scandal if the Applicant could not be prosecuted for two killings of which he may be guilty because of the prior prosecution.

    (per Spigelman CJ)5. With respect to the acquittal for the murder of the brother: as the Applicant was not in jeopardy, the breach of the incontrovertibility principle that has been identified is not sufficient to justify the relief sought by the Applicant. [56], [96], [97]6. With respect to the conviction for manslaughter of the brother: where the Applicant has procured an unduly favourable result by pleading to a lesser charge, and was not in jeopardy of a conviction on the more serious charge, then the interests of the administration of justice are best served by allowing prosecutions of serious charges such as murder to proceed. [114]7. Where the principles of finality, incontrovertibility, and double jeopardy have been breached, there is an abuse of process. [98] The Effect of Delay(per Spigelman CJ, McClellan CJ at CL, Hulme J, Hidden J & Latham J agreeing)1. The trial judge was correct to conclude that the Applicant could receive a fair trial, despite the delay, with appropriate directions to the jury. With respect to the evidence that has been lost, it is appropriate to adopt the approach in R v Helmling. [122], [135], [235], [274], [275] R v Helmling (NSWCCA unreported 11 November 1993) cited. Oppression(per Spigelman CJ, McClellan CJ at CL, Hulme J, Hidden J & Latham J agreeing)1. The trial judge was correct to find that the public interest in permitting serious alleged crimes to be determined on their merits outweighs the Applicant’s expectation that no further proceedings would ensue.

    2. This Court should be very slow to interfere with a broad evaluative judgment of this nature made by a trial judge following a balancing exercise, unless it is satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. This case does not satisfy this threshold for intervention. [131], [135], [235], [274], [275]

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an application for leave to appeal, pursuant to s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, from an interlocutory judgment of Howie J refusing an application by the Applicant for a stay of an ex-officio indictment in which the Appellant is charged with the murder of his parents. 
     
      
    2 On 28 August 1993 the Applicant’s mother, father and brother were stabbed to death. The next day police charged the Applicant with the murder of his brother. On 5 April 1995, the accused pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter of his brother, which plea was accepted in full discharge of the indictment for murder. The basis of the plea of guilty was that the Applicant did kill his brother, but that occurred as a result of provocation resulting from the fact that his brother had killed their parents. 
     
      
    3 The principal issue in this case arises from the inconsistency between the new indictment on charges that the Applicant killed both his parents and the basis of the plea of guilty to the charge of manslaughter of his brother. 
     
      
    4 In addition to this issue, the Applicant seeks leave to appeal from the judgment of Howie J with respect to the effects of delay and the loss of evidence and on the basis of oppression. 
     
      
       
      The Principle of Incontrovertibility 
       
      
    5 The first ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in finding that the present proceedings did not controvert the previous acquittal of the Applicant on the charge of murder. This ground relies on the principle of incontrovertibility of an acquittal, as developed in recent Australian case law.  
     
      
    6 The principle is expressed in the joint judgment of Deane and Gaudron JJ in Rogers v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 273 in terms of: “The need for decisions of the courts, unless set aside or quashed, to be accepted as incontrovertibly correct … That principle is not only fundamental, it is essential for the maintenance of public respect and confidence in the administration of justice”. 
     
      
    7 In Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [53], in a passage subsequently cited, Gummow J referred to the principle identified in Rogers as: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he need for orders and other solemn acts of the counts to be accepted (unless set aside or quashed) as incontrovertibly correct, thereby limiting the scope for conflicting decisions.” 
        
       
       
      This reflected the maxim  
      res judicata pro veritate accipitur 
      . 
       
      
    8 The relevant principles, of which the principle of incontrovertibility is one, discussed by the High Court in a number of decisions since Rogers, for determining the effect of an acquittal in one criminal proceeding upon other criminal proceedings, have most recently been analysed in the joint judgment of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Island Maritime Limited v Filipowski (2006) 226 CLR 328, with which analysis Kirby and Callinan JJ agreed (see at [88]-[89] and [95]). Their Honours emphasised the values which underlie the applicable principles and the interaction of the principles: 
     
      
       
        
        “[41] ‘Double jeopardy’ is an expression that is not always used with a single meaning. It is an expression used in relation to several different stages of the process of criminal justice: prosecution, conviction and punishment. It describes values which underpin a number of aspects of the criminal law, rather than a rule that can be stated as the premise for deductive reasoning. The essence of these values is most often seen as captured in three maxims:  
        interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium  
        (it is in society's interest that there be an end to litigation),  
        res judicata pro veritate accipitur  
        (what is adjudicated is taken as the truth), and  
        nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa  
        (no one should twice be vexed for one and the same cause). It is these values that underpin the rule that evidence is inadmissible where, if accepted, it would overturn or tend to overturn an acquittal [ 
        Garrett v The Queen  
        (1977) 139 CLR 437 at 445; 52 ALJR 206;  
        Rogers v The Queen  
        (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 277-278; 68 ALJR 688;  
        R v Carroll  
        (2002) 213 CLR 635; 77 ALJR 157]. It is these values that inform the rules governing successive prosecutions - rules which find their origins in the pleas in bar of autrefois convict and autrefois acquit but now have wider application than those pleas in bar.  
        
       
       
        
        [42] Principles governing the availability of a plea in bar of either autrefois convict or autrefois acquit were developed and applied in courts of record. As Deane and Gaudron JJ pointed out in  
        Rogers v The Queen  
        [(1994) 181 CLR 251 at 276-277; 68 ALJR 688], ‘[a]utrefois convict is the application in criminal proceedings of the doctrine of merger which gives rise to res judicata or cause of action estoppel in civil proceedings’. Just as judgment of a court of record in a civil action changes the cause of action to a matter of record [ 
        Thompson v Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd  
        (1996) 186 CLR 574 at 606; 71 ALJR 131], conviction in a court of record in respect of a criminal offence brings about ‘the substitution of a new liability’ [ 
        R v Wilkes  
        (1948) 77 CLR 511 at 519]. As Gummow J noted in  
        Pearce [Pearce v The Queen  
        (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [53]-[54]; 72 ALJR 1416], this principle of merger is connected with, but distinct from, the principles encapsulated in the three maxims cited earlier. Those principles are of fundamental importance to the structure and operation of our legal system.  
        
       
       
        
        [43] The plea of autrefois acquit ‘is the species of estoppel by which the Crown is precluded from reasserting the guilt of the accused when that question has previously been determined against it’ [Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley,  
        The Doctrine of Res Judicata  
        (3rd ed, 1996), p311]. It is a plea that prevents the relitigation of matters already determined in favour of the accused. Like the plea of autrefois convict, the plea of autrefois acquit prevents inconsistent decisions, serves to maintain the acceptance of orders and other solemn acts of the courts as incontrovertibly correct, and avoids the injustice occasioned by the relitigation of what has already been determined. But until more recent times, the pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict ‘remained the only manifestations of the rule against double jeopardy’ [Hunter, ‘The Development of the Rule Against Double Jeopardy’ (1984) 5  
        Journal of Legal History  
        3 at 14]. As the criminal law has become more complex, and as the number of offences that may be dealt with summarily has increased, questions of double jeopardy have taken on greater significance. When criminal offences were relatively few and distinct, a single course of conduct would constitute but one offence. With the proliferation of overlapping and related statutory offences, a single allegedly criminal transaction will often yield numerous offences [ 
        Ashe v Swenson  
        397 US 436 at 445 (1970)]. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [52] The values embraced by notions of double jeopardy require that autrefois acquit and analogous principles are given no narrow operation. In particular, neither the plea in bar nor the analogous principle applied in summary jurisdiction is to be confined to precluding the prosecution from controverting one or more elements of an offence charged first where the elements of that first offence are wholly included in the second. …” 
        
       
      
    9 Their Honours also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[55] … the refusal to permit the prosecution to have a second opportunity to prove what was found not to have been established at an earlier trial is based in the need to maintain the incontrovertible character of that earlier decision.  
        
       
       
        
        [56] It may readily be accepted that the need to maintain the incontrovertibility of earlier decisions can be identified as an important root of the principles of issue estoppel that have been developed and are applied in civil proceedings. But in considering what are the principles that are to be applied in criminal proceedings, it is necessary to return to not only that particular root but also the other values which are encompassed by the notion of double jeopardy. It would be wrong to conclude the inquiry about the principles to be applied in the criminal law at the point of drawing some analogies with the separate principles of issue estoppel in civil litigation simply because those principles are seen to derive from one of the several roots that together are described as double jeopardy.  
        
       
       
        
        [57] Thus, what is revealed by the contrasting outcomes postulated by reference to the example given earlier, according to whether the first offence is tried by jury or tried summarily, is that to treat the plea of autrefois acquit as yielding no more than a form of issue estoppel does not give effect to all of the values embraced by the notion of double jeopardy. In particular, to treat an acquittal on one charge as barring a subsequent prosecution concerning the same events as founded that first charge only where all the elements of the first offence are included in the elements of the second offence not only would fail to accept that the earlier decision was correct, but also would require the individual to relitigate matters that the public interest requires be treated as finally determined.” 
        
       
      
    10 The ground of appeal is expressed in terms of the principle of incontrovertibility. However, the application of this principle must be informed by the values underlying that and the other principles, most relevantly the principle of double jeopardy of bis vexari, in its shortened Latin form. 
     
      
    11 The most directly applicable authoritative statement of the principle of incontrovertibility is found in the judgments of the High Court in The Queen v Carroll (2002) 213 CLR 635. In that case, as in this case, the plea in bar relevantly autrefois acquit, did not apply. Nevertheless, it is now clear that the group of principles extend beyond such pleas in bar.  
     
      
    12 In Rogers at 255, 280, affirmed in Pearce at [29], this extension occurred under the rubric of the power of the Court to prevent an abuse of its process. Subsequently, on the basis of the observations of Gummow J in Pearce at [54], the High Court has identified the three principles reflecting underlying values, for the prevention of abuse of process where there has been a previous acquittal. 
     
      
    13 The public interest in the administration of justice, which underlies all the relevant principles, was emphasised in the joint judgment of Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Carroll at [86]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[86] The interests at stake in a case such as the present were discussed in  
        Rogers v The Queen  
        [(1994) 181 CLR 251 at 273-274] and in  
        Pearce v The Queen  
        [(1998) 194 CLR 610 at 614-615 [9]-[15], 625-626 [53]-[56], 636-637 [89]-[91]]. They touch upon matters fundamental to the structure and operation of the legal system and to the nature of judicial power. First, there is the public interest in concluding litigation through judicial determinations which are final, binding and conclusive [expressed in the maxim interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium]. Secondly, there is the need for orders and other solemn acts of the courts (unless set aside or quashed) to be treated as incontrovertibly correct [expressed in the maxim res judicata pro veritatem accipitur]. This reduces the scope for conflicting judicial decisions, which would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute [cf  
        Abebe v The Commonwealth  
        (1999) 197 CLR 510]. Thirdly, there is the interest of the individual in not being twice vexed for one and the same cause [expressed in the maxim mnem debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa]. Finally, there is the principle that a cause of action is changed by judgment recovered in a court of record into a matter of record, which is of a higher nature [expressed in the maxim transit in rem judicatam].” 
        
       
      
    14 In Carroll, Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said in their joint judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “[35] … the application for stay is to be understood as being based on what was said in  
        Rogers 
         [(1994) 181 CLR 251 at 273, per Deane and Gaudron JJ) to be ‘the need for decisions of the courts, unless set aside or quashed, to be accepted as incontrovertibly correct’. It is this, rather than now rejected notions of the applicability in criminal cases of the principles of issue estoppel, [ 
        Rogers v The Queen  
        (1994) 181 CLR 251; cf  
        R v Wilkes  
        (1948) 77 CLR 511;  
        Mraz v The Queen [No 2]  
        (1956) 96 CLR 62;  
        R v Storey  
        (1978) 140 CLR 364] which was said to warrant staying the prosecution of the respondent for perjury. Attention must first be directed to the ambit and effect of the proposition that the verdict of acquittal at the first trial is to be treated as incontrovertibly correct. Only then will it emerge whether it is necessary to consider the nature or quality of the evidence that it is sought to adduce on the second trial, in this case, for perjury.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [37] The principle is stated in various ways. In  
        Garrett v The Queen 
        , Barwick CJ, with whose reasons Stephen, Mason and Jacobs JJ agreed, described [ 
        Garrett v The Queen  
        (1977) 139 CLR 437 at 445] it as being that ""the acquittal may not be questioned  
        or called in question 
         by any evidence which, if accepted, would overturn or  
        tend to overturn 
         the verdict"" (emphasis added). Reference to calling in question and tending to overturn give the principle great width: wider than may be thought to have been stated by the Privy Council in  
        Sambasivam v Public Prosecutor, Federation of Malaya  
        [[1950] AC 458 at 479, per Lord MacDermott], a case often referred to in this connection.” 
        
       
      
    15 In their joint judgment Gaudron and Gummow JJ said of this passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “[93] We agree with the remarks of the Chief Justice and Hayne J in the present case respecting the decisions in  
        Rogers 
         and  
        Garrett 
        . Those authorities support the proposition that a prior acquittal itself cannot subsequently be controverted; it is unnecessary here to decide whether they support any wider proposition.” 
        
       
      
    16 The joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Hayne J went on to say, in reasoning which, as I understand the judgment of Gaudron and Gummow JJ, their Honours did not find it necessary to adopt: 
     
      
       
        
        “[38] In  
        Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions 
         [1964] AC 1254 at 1364 Lord Pearce said:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘A man ought not to be tried for a second offence which is manifestly inconsistent  
          on the facts 
           with either a previous conviction or a previous acquittal. And it is clear that the formal pleas which a defendant can claim as of right will not cover all such cases. Instead of attempting to enlarge the pleas beyond their proper scope, it is better that the courts should apply to such cases an avowed judicial discretion based on the broader principles which underlie the pleas.’ (Emphasis in original)  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [40] There are cases where a charge of an offence would be manifestly inconsistent on the facts with a previous acquittal, even though no plea of autrefois acquit is available. Since, in most cases of trial by jury, it will not be known why the accused was acquitted, and in many cases the reason may simply be that the jury had a doubt about whether the prosecution had established some element of the offence, the inconsistency, if it exists, will appear from a comparison of the elements of the new charge with the verdict of not guilty of the previous charge, understood in the light of the issues at the first trial. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [42] In the present case, there was manifest inconsistency between the charge of perjury and the acquittal of murder. That inconsistency arose because the prosecution based the perjury charge solely upon the respondent's sworn denial of guilt. The alleged false testimony consisted of a negative answer to a question, asked by his counsel, whether the respondent killed the child. The fact that the question asked was whether the respondent killed Deidre Kennedy rather than whether he murdered her, or whether he was guilty, is immaterial. Discretionary decisions do not turn upon such differences. Once such manifest inconsistency appeared, then the case for a stay of proceedings was irresistible. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [44] … The inconsistency between the charge of perjury and the acquittal of murder was direct and plain. The laying of the charge of perjury, solely on the basis of the respondent's sworn denial of guilt, for the evident purpose of establishing his guilt of murder, was an abuse of process regardless of the cogency and weight of the further evidence that was said to be available.  
        
       
       
        
        [45] The need for decisions of the courts, unless set aside or quashed, to be accepted as incontrovertibly correct is a principle which requires that it is the verdict of acquittal which should be incontrovertible. It is not necessary in this case to attempt to decide what may be the limits of the principle about incontrovertibility and, in any event, it would be unwise to attempt to do so. … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [47] Whether  
        Rogers 
         or  
        Garrett 
         should be understood as standing for some wider proposition need not be decided, although it may be accepted that there may be cases where a second prosecution is argued to be oppressive and an abuse of process, even though there is no direct inconsistency between the new charge and the earlier verdict. The circumstances that may constitute oppression or an abuse of process are various[ See, eg,  
        Walton v Gardiner  
        (1993) 177 CLR 378]. The discretionary considerations that may be relevant in dealing with them cannot be rigidly confined. Nevertheless, where it is said that the abuse lies in seeking to controvert an earlier verdict of acquittal, there appears much to be said for the view that it is necessary to direct attention to the elements of the offence of which the person was acquitted and the elements of the offence with which the person is later charged. Seldom, if ever, will considering whether the later charge controverts an earlier acquittal require attention to whether evidence which would be led at a second trial is new or persuasive.  
        
       
       
        
        [48] To approach the question by directing attention to the elements of the two offences would recognise that the principle that an acquittal is incontrovertible is a principle founded in the finality of judicial proceedings [United Kingdom, Law Commission,  
        Double Jeopardy and Prosecution Appeals  
        (2001) Cm 5048, par 4.2] and that it is what is decided in litigation that is final. Directing attention to evidence given at an earlier trial may serve to detract attention from what it is that was decided.” 
        
       
      
    17 McHugh J came to the same conclusion on the basis that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[117] … the charge against the respondent for perjury was an abuse of process because it had a tendency to undermine the respondent's acquittal of an earlier charge of murder.  
        
       
       
        
        [118] It is an abuse of process for the Crown to charge a person with an offence of perjury when proof of the charge necessarily contradicts or tends to undermine an acquittal of the accused in respect of another criminal charge. A perjury charge that has that effect is an abuse of process even if the evidence supporting the charge is different from the evidence that supported the prosecution case in respect of the charge on which the accused was acquitted. The long established policy of the law is that an acquittal is not to be contradicted or undermined by a subsequent charge that raises the same ultimate issue or issues as was or were involved in the acquittal. That is so even though the evidence proving perjury is unanswerable.” 
        
       
      
    18 The formulation applied by McHugh J, namely “contradicts or tends to undermine an acquittal”, reflects terminology from Garrett v The Queen (1977) 139 CLR 437 at 445, also adopted by Gleeson CJ and Hayne J at [37].  
     
      
    19 McHugh J also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[130] … [I]f the prosecution can bring further and different charges arising out of facts all or many of which were before the court in an earlier prosecution, the accused is as effectively harassed as if he was being tried again on the same charge. Similarly, if other proceedings could be brought that had the tendency to contradict or undermine the effect of an acquittal, an acquitted person might effectively lose the benefit of the acquittal and the full protection of the double jeopardy principle. Plainly, the formal pleas of autrefois convict or autrefois acquit were inadequate to give effect to the full rationale of the double jeopardy rule and the policy behind it in some cases where the prosecution brought successive proceedings against an accused person. The pleas of autrefois convict and autrefois acquit were confined to successive charges based on the same or substantially the same facts. They do not protect the accused against prosecutorial harassment in many cases that, in substance but not in form, offend the double jeopardy principle.  
        
       
       
        
        [131] To remedy these and other defects in the application of the double jeopardy principle, the common law courts have applied other weapons in the judicial armoury to make the double jeopardy principle more effective. In particular, they now intervene to protect the accused by staying proceedings that they consider are an abuse of their processes …” 
        
       
      
    20 McHugh J went on to refer to the House of Lords judgment in Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] AC 1254 and also to Garrett, including that part of the judgment of Barwick CJ emphasised in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Hayne J. His Honour then referred to Rogers and returned to the formulation in Garrett, which I have already quoted, and placed in italics that part of the judgment of Barwick CJ at 445 referring to evidence which if accepted would “tend to overturn the verdict”. (See at [138] and also at [146].) 
     
      
    21 The formulation as to whether or not an acquittal is “called in question” or subsequent prosecution has a tendency to “overturn” or “undermine” the verdict of acquittal, indicates the potential breadth of the principle of incontrovertibility. However, I do not understand the judgments in Carroll, other than that of McHugh J, to propound a test that anything which can answer the description of ‘calling in question’ or ‘tending to undermine’ infringes the principle of incontrovertibility.  
     
      
    22 Gleeson CJ and Hayne J went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        [50] Finality of a verdict of acquittal does not necessarily prevent the institution of proceedings, or the tender of evidence, which might have the incidental effect of casting doubt upon, or even demonstrating the error of, an earlier decision. There may be cases where, at a later trial of other allegedly similar conduct of an accused, evidence of conduct may be adduced even though the accused had earlier been charged with, tried for, and acquitted of an offence said to be constituted by that conduct.  
        R v Z  
        [[2000] 2 AC 483],  
        R v Arp 
         [[1998] 3 SCR 339]and  
        R v Degna  
        [[2001] 1 NZLR 280] are cases of that kind. In such cases, the earlier acquittal would not be controverted by a guilty verdict at the second trial.” 
        
       
      
    23 The test which their Honours applied was the formulation from the judgment of Lord Pearce in Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions at 1364, i.e. whether the prosecution under consideration is “manifestly inconsistent on the facts with a previous acquittal”. This requires, as Gleeson CJ and Hayne J emphasised at [40]-[41], quoted above, a focus upon a comparison of the elements of the new charge with the verdict on the previous charge “in the light of the issues at the first trial”. Such a conclusion will readily be drawn if the relevant inconsistency can be characterised as “direct and plain” [44].  
     
      
    24 Their Honours conclusion was: 
     
      
       
        
        “[42] In the present case, there was manifest inconsistency between the charge of perjury and the acquittal of murder … once such manifest inconsistency appeared, then the case for a stay of proceedings was irresistible.” 
        
       
       
      The Judgment of Howie J 
       
      
    25 In the present case, Howie J referred to the authorities on the issue of whether or not the conviction after plea to manslaughter constituted an acquittal of a charge of murder, particularly Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501. After expressing some doubts, his Honour proceeded on the basis that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[111] … the acceptance of the plea to manslaughter resulted in a decision by the Crown not to lead evidence on the charge of murder and, as a consequence, there was in effect an acquittal of the charge of murder.” 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour made reference to the findings of Abadee J in his remarks on sentence after the plea to manslaughter and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[123] In the present proceedings Abadee J made no findings of fact. That situation should be contrasted with that in  
        Rogers v The Queen  
        [1994] 181 CLR 251. In that case there was a finding that the relevant records of interview were not voluntary: a ruling made after a contested hearing before the trial judge. That finding was incontrovertible at least once a verdict of acquittal had been returned and could not later be challenged by the Crown. It was a positive finding made by the trial judge and, therefore, there was an abuse of process for the Crown to attempt to relitigate the issue:  
        Carroll  
        at [46], [91] and [136], In my view the only incontrovertible or final finding in the present case is that the accused was guilty of the manslaughter of his brother. 
        
       
       
        
        [124] It may well be the case, as the Crown conceded before me, that, had the accused been convicted of manslaughter after trial, the situation would have been different. For one thing there would then clearly have been an acquittal of the charge of murdering his brother recorded as the verdict of the court. It may well be the case that had the only basis for manslaughter left to the jury been provocation, a verdict by the jury finding the accused guilty of manslaughter might have inhibited the Crown from asking a second jury to find facts inconsistent with that verdict. But that is not what happened in this case. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [127] However the question arises as to whether the acquittal of the charge of murder of his brother arising from the acceptance of the plea to manslaughter would require that the trial be stayed so as not to breach the principle against double jeopardy. Clearly the killing of the brother occurred as part of the series of events that also resulted in the death of the parents. The facts surrounding the killing are intertwined. The killing of the parents could not sensibly be considered without a consideration of the killing of the brother. By asking the jury to find that the accused killed the parents, is the Crown seeking to call into question the acquittal for the murder of the brother such that it offends double jeopardy? Would the trial judge need to direct the jury that they must give the acquittal of the murder of the brother full weight? Would such a direction mean that the jury could not do so and yet convict the accused of the murder of his parents? 
        
       
       
        
        [128] The decisions that have held that the prosecution cannot seek to call into question an acquittal are cases where the later prosecution relates to a further allegation in respect of the same victim. They raise the issue of double jeopardy clearly because the prosecution is attempting to secure a conviction directly contrary to an issue that has been determined by the previous acquittal. However it is of crucial significance in my view that in each case the acquittal was a result of a jury verdict after trial.” 
        
       
      
    27 His Honour referred to a number of cases on double jeopardy, noting at [132] that in Carroll: “The focus of both prosecutions was the one and same fact: did he kill the victim?” 
     
      
    28 His Honour considered the principle of incontrovertibility and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[140] In my opinion the incontrovertibility that has been accorded a verdict of acquittal after trial by jury, or a determination of fact made after a hearing on the merits, or by the terms of a particular statutory provision should not be applied to a situation where the acquittal arose incidentally by the Crown accepting a plea of guilty to a lesser offence. I do not see that any of the policy considerations, even giving the double jeopardy principle its widest scope, require that a verdict of acquittal to murder, arising from the acceptance of a plea to manslaughter, be given the status of incontrovertibility so that it is immune from further consideration by a jury at other proceedings. The real verdict recorded by the Court was a conviction of manslaughter. That was the only finding that the Judge was required to make. If the verdict of acquittal of murder is recorded at all, it can only be in the recording of the acceptance of the plea of guilty to the manslaughter charge. 
        
       
       
        
        [141] But more significantly there was no positive finding by a tribunal of fact, whether it be by judge or jury, that the accused was not guilty of the charge of murder. Nor was there any statutory provision to give it that effect. To the extent that the issue arising from the charge of murder was joined between the parties on the accused pleading not guilty on arraignment, the issue was concluded when the Crown accepted the plea of guilty in discharge of the indictment. On the authorities the acceptance of the plea resulted in a decision not to lead evidence on the murder charge so that an acquittal resulted. But that was an automatic result following upon the acceptance of the plea and there was no decision on the merits of the allegation of murder. There was no finding made by the Court other than that the accused was guilty of manslaughter. There was nothing that gave the verdict of acquittal the status of a verdict delivered after a trial by jury in accordance with the principle in  
        Sambasivam. 
        
       
       
        
        [142] It was in my view at most a technical acquittal that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit on the charge of murdering his brother. There can be no question that such a result should follow the acceptance by the Crown of the plea of guilty to manslaughter. But I do not understand why the acquittal of murder should be accorded more substance than that. I doubt that the accused, the Crown or the Judge understood that the accused had been acquitted of the charge of murder by the adoption of that procedure. In those circumstances I do not see why fairness to the accused or the preservation of the Court’s determination should require that the Crown now be precluded from prosecuting the accused with murdering his parents on the basis that the acquittal of murdering his brother prevents a jury from considering the circumstances in which that killing arose. The acceptance of the plea of guilty was on the basis that the Crown could not at that time negative that the accused acted in provocation. The acquittal means no more than that. In my opinion there would be no manifest inconsistency between a conviction of manslaughter of his brother and convictions of murder of his parents that would bring the courts in disrepute or undermine the principle of incontrovertibility of verdicts after trial.” 
        
       
      
    29 His Honour also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[144] If the accused’s submission be correct and the prosecution cannot proceed because to do so must inevitably challenge the acquittal, the accused could not be prosecuted even in the face of the most damning evidence of his guilt of murdering his parents that came to light since the sentencing proceedings for the manslaughter of his brother. And this only because at that time of taking the plea the Crown could not negative that the accused was acting under provocation. I do not believe that the principle of double jeopardy goes so far as to protect the accused from prosecution for the crime of murdering his parents simply because he pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his brother and, as an incident of the acceptance of the plea, was acquitted of the murder of his brother. 
        
       
       
        
        [145] In the passage quoted above from  
        Carroll  
        Gleeson CJ and Hayne J left open the limits of the principle of incontrovertibility. I would limit it, at least in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary, to a decision following a hearing on the merits by the tribunal of fact. That would include a case where there was a jury verdict for whatever reason, including where the Crown offered no evidence on, or there was not evidence of, a particular count in the indictment. This seems to me to be consistent with the authorities that have examined and applied the principle. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [147] In my opinion there is nothing in  
        Carroll  
        that suggests that the proposed prosecution is in breach of the formal aspects of double jeopardy that I am here considering: that is there is nothing that legally prevents the Crown from seeking to have the accused convicted of murdering his parents. It may be that the evidence led by the prosecution would give rise to an inference that the accused was wrongly convicted of manslaughter and should have been convicted of murder, but the further prosecution does not seek to negative, substitute, or relitigate that verdict: cf  
        Carroll  
        at [103]. I know of no decision that has held that a later prosecution cannot call into question, at last incidentally, a previous conviction. There are cases that have held in effect that a later prosecution might incidentally call into question an earlier acquittal provided it does not seek to controvert it: see  
        R v Z  
        [2000] 2 AC 483;  
        R v Degnan  
        [2001] 1 NZLR 280;  
        Carroll  
        at [5] and [94]; and  
        R v VN  
        [2006] VSCA 111. 
        
       
       
        
        [148] The conviction of manslaughter proves that the accused unlawfully killed his brother. That is not an issue that is in dispute at the proposed trial. The proposed prosecution does not put that verdict in jeopardy in any sense. A verdict that the accused murdered his parents is not necessarily inconsistent with an allegation that he unlawfully killed his brother, even if the jury might think that the conviction should have been for murder rather than manslaughter. The Crown is not bound by its acceptance of the plea to manslaughter on the basis of provocation and there is no fact decided by the sentence imposed upon the accused by Abadee J. There is in my opinion no breach of the principle against double jeopardy by the further prosecution of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    30 As the judgment of Howie J, and the submissions in this Court recognise, the most directly relevant authority for present purposes on the principle of incontrovertibility is the judgment of the High Court in Carroll supra. In that case the Respondent was charged with perjury for giving evidence at his trial for murder that he had not killed the victim. He had been convicted, but the conviction was quashed and a verdict of not guilty entered on appeal. 
     
      
    31 The facts of this case differ in a critical respect. The Applicant was never charged with the murder of his parents. There was, accordingly, no direct inconsistency of the character with which the Court was concerned in Carroll. Nevertheless, there was an element of inconsistency because the acquittal, if it be such, to the charge of murder of the Applicant’s brother was based, and based only, on alleged provocation by reason of the circumstance that his brother had in fact killed their parents. 
     
      
    32 Mr P Boulton SC, who appeared for the Applicant, submitted that by instituting the current prosecution the Crown was “in effect controverting the earlier verdict” of acquittal of the murder of the brother. This, he submitted, offended the principle of incontrovertibility. 
     
      
    33 In the final analysis, Howie J determined the issue adversely to the Applicant by applying the “manifest inconsistency” test derived from Connelly and applied by Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in Carroll. To repeat the last sentence of his Honour’s par [142]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion there would be no manifest inconsistency between a conviction of manslaughter of his brother and convictions of murder of his parents that would bring the courts into disrepute or undermine the principle of incontrovertibility of verdicts after trial.” 
        
       
      
    34 The Applicant challenges this conclusion. 
     
      
    35 Submissions were made to this Court as to how it was proposed that the Applicant receive the “full benefit of the acquittal” in the first proceedings. (A phrase derived from R v Storey (1978) 140 CLR 364 at 372.) However, that proposition should be regarded, for present purposes, to be “a particular restatement of” the principle of incontrovertibility. (See AJS v The Queen [2007] HCA 27; 81 ALJR 1208 at [24].) With respect to the conclusion of Howie J, that there may be no need to refer to the outcome of the charge for killing the brother, see AJS at [25]-[26]. The relevance and content of a possible direction to the jury in this regard has now been elucidated by the High Court in Washer v Western Australia [2007] HCA 48 esp at [30]-[37]. 
     
      
    36 Three key issues arise on the submissions in this Court: 
     
      
       
      1 Was the Applicant acquitted of murdering his brother? 
       
       
      2 Do the new charges fall within the incontrovertibility principle? 
       
       
      3 Was the Applicant relevantly in legal jeopardy? 
       
       
      The Acquittal Issue 
       
      
    37 Although his Honour proceeded on the basis that the first trial concluded in an acquittal on the murder charge, he expressed some doubts about that proposition and indicated a view that the effect of the acceptance of the plea to manslaughter was in the nature of a nolle prosequi rather than an acquittal. The Crown has, on this appeal, submitted that Maxwell supra is not authority for the proposition that, in the circumstances of this case, there was an acquittal of murder of the brother. 
     
      
    38 The Crown submits that the Applicant has not been acquitted of the charge of murder of the brother. Nevertheless, it accepts that there would be an effective plea in bar should the Crown now seek to proceed on a murder charge with respect to the killing of the brother. The plea in bar would be a plea autrefois convict. In my opinion, for the reasons given below, the principle autrefois acquit, as extended by High Court authority, would also apply. That does not, however, determine the outcome of this appeal. 
     
      
    39 Section 394A of the Crimes Act 1900, which was in force at the time relevant to this case, does not contain an express reference to the fact that a plea to manslaughter leads to an acquittal on the charge of murder. This contrasts with the position in legislation from other jurisdictions, eventually adopted in this State by subsequent amendment as s399 of the Crimes Act, now found in s157 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
    40 It is clear that Gaudron and Gummow JJ were of the view in Maxwell that the conviction for a lesser offence under s394A of the Crimes Act 1900 “necessarily involves an acquittal” on the charge of murder (at 527). However, the Crown contended that there was ambiguity in the reasoning of McHugh and Dawson JJ on the issue. Their Honours said at 511-512, with respect to s394A: 
     
      
       
        
        “The practical effect of a prosecutor’s acceptance of the plea of guilty to manslaughter was that he led no evidence upon the charge of murder in the indictment.” 
        
       
      
    41 Although this terminology does not expressly adopt the proposition that there was an “acquittal” on the murder charge, nevertheless, it is, in my opinion, to the same effect. Their Honours hypothesise an actual trial upon indictment which has reached the stage of the Crown tendering evidence and no evidence consistent with murder being proffered. That situation must lead to an acquittal. It is not, in law, identical to a nolle prosequi which occurs prior to an accused being put on trial upon an indictment. 
     
      
    42 In any event, this Court has decided this issue in R v Maxwell (1994) 34 NSWLR 606 where Gleeson CJ, with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Badgery-Parker J agreed, said at 614: 
     
      
       
        
        “… In a case where s394A is invoked, the consideration which so influenced the Court in  
        R v Naraindeen  
        is present. What is involved is not only a conviction of the lesser charge but also an acquittal of the more serious charge. … For practical purposes I would give this section substantially the same operation as the Canadian provision which was considered in  
        R v Naraindeen.” 
        
       
      
    43 It is true, as the Crown submitted, that s606(4) of the Canadian Criminal Code under consideration in R v Naraindeen (1990) 75 CR (2d) 120, provided expressly that the acceptance of the plea of guilty resulted in a finding that the accused was not guilty of the offence charged. As indicated there were no such express words in s394A of the New South Wales Crimes Act. Nevertheless, this was not a matter which their Honours overlooked, as the reference to “for practical purposes” attests. Indeed this reference may well have informed the reference to “practical effect” in the joint judgment of Dawson and McHugh JJ on appeal. 
     
      
    44 As the recent judgments on double jeopardy in the High Court, including Carroll, confirm, the focus on the underlying values involved in the applicable principles requires the court to be concerned with matters of substance rather than of form. 
     
      
    45 This Court should follow its own earlier judgment unless satisfied that it is wrong. I can see no reason to doubt the judgment of this Court in Maxwell.  
     
      
    46 In my opinion, the submission of the Crown that the acceptance of a plea to manslaughter does not involve an acquittal of the charge of murder should be rejected. Even if there was no formal acquittal, the Applicant was entitled to such an order. (C/f AJS supra at [19].) 
     
      
       
       
      The Incontrovertibility Issue 
       
      
    47 The statutory provision allowing for the defence of provocation to a charge of murder is found in s23 of the Crimes Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “23(1) Where, on the trial of a person for murder, it appears that the act or omission causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation and, but for this subsection and the provocation, the jury would have found the accused guilty of murder, the jury shall acquit the accused of murder and find the accused guilty of manslaughter.” 
        
       
      
    48 If the 1995 proceedings on the charge of murder of the brother had gone to trial and the jury had returned a verdict of manslaughter then the finding of fact by the jury as to the nature and content of the provocation would have led more clearly to the conclusion that there was a manifest inconsistency with a new charge of murder of the parents. However, as emphasised by Howie J, there was no such finding of fact by a jury. The Crown accepted a plea of manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment. It did so, as Howie J found, on the basis that the Crown was not able to discharge its onus of disproving the provocation upon which the Applicant relied. 
     
      
    49 It may have been accurate to describe the process as having a “tendency to undermine” the verdict of acquittal or, more clearly, to “call it in question”, to adopt the terminology of Barwick CJ in Garrett. However, the generality of this language is not, as I understand the authority of Carroll, directly applicable. If it were then the passage at [50] of the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Hayne J with respect to an “incidental effect” would have little work to do. (See par [22] above.) 
     
      
    50 It may very well be that there was an issue estoppel, in the civil law sense, with respect to the question of who killed the parents, arising by reason of the acceptance of the plea on the basis of the provocation said to be constituted by a brother having done so. However, as determined in Rogers, the principle of incontrovertibility is not the civil law concept of issue estoppel. The applicable principles serve different values. 
     
      
    51 Elements of fact and degree arise when determining whether or not the doubt cast upon the acquittal for murder of the brother by reason of proceedings on charges of murder of the parents, is merely an “incidental effect” (within the meaning of the words used by Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in Carroll at [50]), or a possible inconsistency on the one hand, or whether they constitute a “manifest inconsistency” (see Carroll at [38], [40] and [42]), on the other hand. It is necessary to compare the “elements of the new charge” of murder of the parents, and the “verdict of not guilty” of the murder of the brother (see at [40]).  
     
      
    52 On one view, the verdict of not guilty of murder does not, as a verdict, demonstrate that the Applicant acted under the provocation of his brother’s murder of their parents. Indeed, that verdict does not indicate any kind of felonious killing. It is only the conviction for manslaughter that does so. Nevertheless, a manifest inconsistency may be said to arise when the basis of the acquittal is known, as it is here. 
     
      
    53 There will be issues determined in the course of a criminal trial leading to an acquittal which, in the absence of a doctrine of issue estoppel, will have no effect on a subsequent trial. However, the matter before the Court involves an issue of central significance to the determination of the earlier trial. 
     
      
    54 The fact that the killing of the parents occurred in the same sequence of events as the killing of the brother is not the critical factor. (See Pearce supra at [25]-[26] and Filipowski supra at [43].) The critical factor is the basis upon which the acquittal of the murder of the brother occurred. 
     
      
    55 The series of cases in the High Court, from Rogers and Pearce through Carroll to Filipowski, apply the principle of incontrovertibility on the basis of the values underlying the principle. Such a focus requires this Court not to be concerned with technical distinctions. The pith and substance of the disposal of the original proceedings was that the Applicant was acquitted of murder on the basis that he acted under the provocation of his brother having killed their parents. This is not simply an inconsistency. Although a different judgment is clearly open, this is, in my opinion, a manifest inconsistency in accordance with the test applied in Carroll. 
     
      
    56 The same focus on values also requires this Court to have regard to the other two principles of finality and double jeopardy, reflected in the maxims referred to in the authorities set out above. If, notwithstanding an order of acquittal, the Applicant was not in jeopardy of a conviction for murder at the first trial then, in my opinion, even the existence of a manifest inconsistency would not be sufficient to constitute the kind of abuse of process that would warrant a permanent stay of proceedings. In the present case, unless the principle of double jeopardy was also engaged, the principle of incontrovertibility would not justify the orders sought by the Applicant. The alleged provocation which led to the acquittal for murder would give rise to no more than an issue estoppel of the kind which is only effective in civil proceedings. 
     
      
       
      The Jeopardy Issue 
       
      
    57 The Crown submitted on the appeal that the principle of double jeopardy does not apply unless the accused has in fact been in jeopardy on the first occasion. It submitted that, on the facts of this case, the Applicant was not in legal jeopardy of a conviction for murder at the first trial. 
     
      
    58 The question that falls to be determined is whether a person was in legal jeopardy when, without trial, the Crown accepted a plea of guilty to a lesser charge and the accused was acquitted of the more serious charge. There can be little doubt that the quality of such an acquittal does differ from an acquittal after trial. Is this difference determinative? 
     
      
    59 Howie J distinguished the case law on incontrovertibility on the basis that, in each case, the two sets of proceedings involved the same victim. However, that is not an accurate description of the facts in Carroll. The second trial was a perjury trial with respect to the denial in the first trial that Carroll had killed the deceased. The “victim” in the second perjury trial was, in substance, the public because of its interest in the administration of justice. 
     
      
    60 It is not permissible to take a narrow, technical view of the issues that arise with respect to the principles now under consideration. It is not appropriate to state that, as the Applicant has never stood charged with the murder of his parents he can be said never to have stood in jeopardy in that respect.  
     
      
    61 In my opinion, identity of the victim is not a requirement of the operation of either the incontrovertibility principle or the double jeopardy principle. A manifest inconsistency can arise between the elements of one offence and the verdict in another. For the reasons I have given above, such inconsistency arises here. 
     
      
    62 The second way in which Howie J distinguished the earlier cases was on the basis that, in each case, there had been an acquittal after trial. (See at [128] and [140]-[141] set out at [26] and [28] above.) 
     
      
    63 Howie J referred to the frequently cited passage from Sambasivam v Public Prosecutor, Federation of Malaya [1950] AC 458 at 479: 
     
      
       
        
        “The effect of a verdict of acquittal pronounced by a competent court on a lawful charge and  
        after a lawful trial  
        is not completely stated by saying that the person acquitted cannot be tried again for the same offence. To that it must be added that the verdict is binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the adjudication.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    64 The emphasised words a “lawful trial” were relied upon by Howie J to conclude that where, as here, the acquittal arose by reason of the acceptance of a plea to a lesser charge, the principles of incompatibility and double jeopardy were not infringed. It must, however, be borne in mind that Gleeson CJ and Hayne J noted at [37] in Carroll that the principle established by recent Australian authorities is of greater width than that stated by the Privy Council in Sambasivam. 
     
      
    65 In response to the reasoning of Howie J, that the acceptance of a plea did not involve a litigated controversy, the Applicant invoked findings to the effect that the Applicant murdered his brother because the brother had murdered their parents, made by Justice Abadee in the course of his remarks on sentence. In my opinion, these findings are of no significance for present purposes.  
     
      
    66 The process of adducing evidence and making findings for purposes of sentencing is quite distinct from what is required for purposes of determining criminal liability. Pursuant to s4(2) of the Evidence Act 1995, that Act applies to a sentencing hearing only if the Court directs that the law of evidence applies. There was no such direction in the proceedings before Abadee J when he sentenced the Applicant. 
     
      
    67 The focus in recent Australian case law upon the values underlying the principles of double jeopardy and of incontrovertibility requires the Court to have regard to the nature of the fact finding exercise said to give rise to an inconsistency or double jeopardy or finality. Nothing that transpired before Abadee J, in the course of a hearing where all parties accepted the proposition that the Applicant was provoked by the fact that his brother had murdered their parents, is capable of giving rise to an infringement of the principles. By the time of the sentencing hearing, any issue relating to the charge of murder had been removed from factual contention between the parties. 
     
      
    68 Mr Boulten, for the Applicant, submitted that the words “after a lawful trial” in Sambasivam, identify situations in which there had never been any jeopardy faced by the accused, for example, where there had been some technical challenge to the indictment. The scope of the proposition that an accused must have been placed in jeopardy on the first occasion, is the critical issue to be determined. 
     
      
    69 An accused is not relevantly in legal jeopardy if a charge is dismissed when: 
     
      
    · The information failed to allege essential elements of the offence (Broome v Chenoweth (1946) 73 CLR 583). 
     
      
    · The charge was bad for duplicity (R v VN [2006] 15 VR 113 at [75]-[76]). 
     
      
    · There was a defect on the face of the information (Hackwill v Kay [1960] VR 632). 
     
      
    · An essential precondition to the institution of proceedings was not satisfied (Korczynski v Quik Foods Pty Ltd (1985) 7 FCR 201). 
     
      
    70 The issue before this Court is whether an accused can be said not to have been in jeopardy in circumstances of a different character, namely, where the Crown accepted in advance of trial that, on the evidence available to it, no conviction could occur. 
     
      
    71 The most recent authority in Australia on the need for a person invoking the double jeopardy principle to have actually been placed in jeopardy is Filipowski supra in which the Court applied a line of Australian authority which, relevantly, finds its origin in the judgments of Dixon and Starke JJ in Broome v Chenoweth supra. 
     
      
    72 The test, as formulated by Dixon J in Broome v Chenoweth at 599.9, was whether upon the first charge “there could have been a valid conviction”. This formulation was referred to with approval in the judgments in Filipowski supra at [12], [20], [75], [94]. 
     
      
    73 Filipowski was concerned with the Marine Pollution Act 1987, which created two distinct offences relating to the discharge of oil into State waters. The provisions are set out in Filipowski at [7]-[10]. The Appellant was charged with an offence under Pt 4 of the Act, but there was express provision that that Part would not apply to a discharge to which Pt 2 applied. At trial the prosecution had adduced its evidence at the end of which the Appellant in the High Court submitted successfully that, on the evidence, Pt 2 clearly applied and there was no case to answer on the Pt 4 charge. Accordingly, the summonses were dismissed. Subsequently the Appellant was charged with an offence under Pt 2. It was with respect to the second proceedings that the High Court determined that the Appellant had never stood in jeopardy at the first trial. 
     
      
    74 It is of significance that in the first trial in Filipowski the prosecution case was in fact complete. The fact that what was there involved was summary proceedings, as distinct from a trial on indictment, does not determine the outcome of the application of the principle. (See Filipowski at [15] and [44]-[48].) 
     
      
    75 The joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ, quoted with approval the following passage from Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley, The Doctrine of Res Judicata (3rd ed, 1996) at [59] p32: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[I]t is essential that the defendant has been in jeopardy on the charge. If summary dismissal occurs because the charge is defective,  
        or because as a matter of law the evidence available to the prosecution cannot support a conviction 
        , the defendant will never have been in jeopardy ... . Where the dismissal was not founded upon a consideration of the merits, even in the largest and most liberal sense of that expression, there is no adjudication of the innocence of the accused."" [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    76 In a footnote their Honours referred to Williams v Director of Public Prosecutions [1991] 1 WLR 1160 at 1170 as supporting the passage quoted. Kirby J also referred to Williams at footnote 103 as authority for the proposition that the Appellant in Filipowski had never been in jeopardy.  
     
      
    77 In Williams at p1170, Rougier J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the purposes of the present appeal, we have to consider two possible situations in which a defendant may or may not be in jeopardy. The first is what I have called the ‘temporal’ question, namely whether the proceedings had reached such a stage that he was in peril of conviction. The second is ‘qualitative’, whether the imperfection (I deliberately choose a neutral word) of the proceedings which led to the original decision in the defendant’s favour was of such a kind that he would never have been in danger of conviction. This second situation is independent of the first, and it is, therefore, necessary to deal with each in turn. 
        
       
       
        
        As to the temporal situation, I have reached the conclusion that Mr Hughes is correct in his submission that the point of time at which the defendant becomes in peril has to be some formal stage at or after the start of the proceedings. Herein assistance is to be derived from two cases. The first is  
        Reg v Tonner  
        [1985] 1 WLR 344, where it was held that on an indictment a trial starts, not upon the arraignment of the defendant but once a jury has been sworn and the defendant has been put in their charge. In dealing with a situation in the magistrates’ court in  
        Reg v Hammersmith Juvenile Court, Ex Parte O  
        (1987) 86 Cr App R 843, the court there held that a trial in a juvenile court begins when the plea is taken. 
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me that in proceedings before justices, this is the logical moment whereat a defendant begins to be in peril of a conviction. Although it could be said that when a preliminary point is taken before plea, battle has been joined, as it were, yet all that is due to happen at that stage is that the point is decided either for or against the defendant; he is not in peril of conviction of the charge he is called upon to answer as a result of that decision. I am of the opinion that the decisions in various defendants’ favour in most of the cases cited to us, and to which I have already referred, are explicable on the basis that the defendant has entered a plea of not guilty.” 
        
       
      
    78 I interpose to note that, in New South Wales, trial by jury has been held for some purposes to commence upon arraignment, before the empanelment of a jury. (See R v Nicolaidis (1994) 33 NSWLR 364 at 367; R v Janceski (2005) 64 NSWLR 10 at [219]; R v Gee (2003) 212 CLR 230 at [17]; R v McNeill (Ruling No 3) [2007] NFSC 4 at [13]-[16] per Weinberg J. However, the issue of when a trial begins may have a different answer for different purposes, particularly where a statute has to be interpreted. (See Director of Public Prosecutions (SA) v B (1998) 194 CLR 566 at [17]; Gee supra at [43]; Donaldson v Western Australia (2005) 31 WAR 122 esp at [41]-[72].)  
     
      
    79 The point of arraignment does not appear to me to be a substantive commencement for purposes of the principles of incontrovertibility, finality and double jeopardy. In my opinion, as the plea was accepted in full discharge before the empanelment of the jury, the Applicant was not relevantly in jeopardy. I agree with Howie J that in substance, the position was the same as if a nolle prosequi had been entered even though there was an acquittal. This conclusion is reinforced to the extent that the principle of incontrovertibility is based on the respect which the courts show to the institution of trial by jury. (See e.g. Washer v Western Australia supra at [45].) 
     
      
    80 The same result ensues from the second situation considered in Williams and to which the observations in Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley were particularly directed. Rougier J went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Turning to the qualitative question, I am of the opinion that the situation in the present case is much more closely comparable with that in  
        Director of Public Prosecutors v Porthouse  
        [1989] RTR 177 and in  
        Jelson (Estates) Ltd v Harvey  
        [1983] 1 WLR 1401. Realistically, the reason whereby the defendant escaped conviction on the first hearing was because the prosecution had framed the charge incorrectly and, by referring to the specimens of breath rather than blood, had put themselves out of court when it came to proving the charge of how much alcohol the defendant had consumed. Assuming, as one is entitled to do, that the matter had ultimately been decided according to correct legal principles, the defendant could never have been convicted. It follows, therefore, in my view, that he was never in jeopardy within the meaning of the phrase as applicable to the doctrine of autrefois acquit.” 
        
       
      
    81 The judgment in Jelson (Estates) Limited v Harvey [1983] 1 WLR 1401, upon which his Honour relied, had determined to accept as authoritative the dissenting judgment of Lush J in Haynes v Davis [1915] 1 KB 332, where, with respect to proposition that an acquittal had to be “on the merits”, being the proposition reflected in the passage from Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley quoted above, Lush J had said at p338-339: 
     
      
       
        
        “I quite agree that ‘acquittal on the merits’ does not necessarily mean that the jury or the magistrate must find as a matter of fact that the person charged was innocent; as it is just as much an acquittal upon the merits if the judge or the magistrate were to rule upon the construction of an Act of Parliament that the accused was in law entitled to be acquitted as in law he was not guilty, and to that extent the expression ‘acquittal on the merits’ must be qualified, but in my view the expression is used by way of antithesis to a dismissal of a charge upon some technical ground which had been a bar to the adjudicating upon it. That is why this expression is important, however one may qualify it, and I think the antithesis is between an adjudication of not guilty upon some matter of fact or law and a discharge of the person charged on the ground that there are reasons why the court cannot proceed to find if he is guilty.” 
        
       
      
    82 In the submissions to this Court the reference to a “technical ground” in this passage was relied upon by Mr Boulten as indicating the extent of the not in jeopardy principle, i.e. that something in the nature of a defect on the face of the indictment or equivalent was required. Mr L Babb, who appeared for the Crown, relied upon the full passage as to what constitutes an “acquittal on the merits” including the passage “reasons why the court cannot proceed to find if he is guilty”.  
     
      
    83 Mr Babb also relied on the close analogy between the present case and another decision which had similarly applied the dissenting judgment of Lush J in Haynes v Davis; namely R v Dabhade [1993] 2 WLR 129. This is the second authority, after Williams v DPP, cited for the proposition in the passage in Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley, referred to with approval in Filipowski, as quoted above.  
     
      
    84 In Dabhade a charge had been dismissed before the magistrate in circumstances in which the prosecution had offered no evidence because the charge as formulated could not, on the evidence available to the prosecution, be made out. After setting out the previous authorities the Court of Appeal concluded at 139: 
     
      
       
        
        “From the foregoing authorities, we have been able to glean the following propositions. 
        
       
       
        
        1 For the principle of autrefois to apply, the defendant must have been put in jeopardy. Quite apart from all other requirements, he must demonstrate that the earlier proceedings that he relied upon must have been commenced – that is, by plea in summary proceedings, or by his being put in charge of the jury in a trial on indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        2 If, thereafter, a charge or count is dismissed, albeit without a hearing on the merits (e.g. on the basis that the prosecution are unable to proceed), there is a well-established principle that the prosecution may not thereafter institute fresh proceedings on the same or an essentially similar charge or count.  
        Reg v Pressick  
        [1978] CLR 377 is an example of the application of this principle, but in the light of the authorities that we have been referred to, it is by no means clear to us that this is necessarily an application of the principle of autrefois acquit. It is, in our judgment, equally and perhaps more easily to be explained as an exercise of the undoubted jurisdiction in the court to prevent an abuse of its own process: see per Lord Devlin in  
        Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions  
        [1964] AC 1254. 
        
       
       
        
        3 If, however, the summary dismissal of the charge or count is because it is apparent that it is defective, either as a matter of law (e.g. for duplicity) or  
        because the evidence available to the prosecution on any view, given the application of proper legal principles, is insufficient to sustain a conviction on the charge as laid 
        , then, in our view, it cannot be properly said that the defendant has ever been in jeopardy of conviction: see  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Porthouse  
        [1989] RTR 177 and  
        Williams v Director of Public Prosecutions  
        [1991] 1 WLR 1160. As a matter of general principle, it does not seem to us to make any difference whether the evidence that the prosecution might otherwise have wished to rely upon is excluded because of some rule of law or statute (as in the  
        Road Traffic Act  
        cases sited) or simply because the evidence on its fact is incapable of proving the particulars of the offence alleged. 
        
       
       
        
        4 If, moreover, the context in which a charge is summarily dismissed is a rationalisation or reorganisation of the prosecution’s case, so that, no doubt in recognition of the difficulties that may lie ahead in the successful prosecution of the original charge, it is decided to substitute therefore a new charge which is regarded as more appropriate to the facts, then the consensual dismissal of the original charge, upon the substitution of the new one, will not give rise to the application of the doctrine of autrefois acquit:  
        Broadbent v High  
        [1985] RTR 359. Admittedly, the prosecution have not been put to their election; but that is merely because it is at their instance that the new and substituted charge is preferred. Apart from anything else, including the fact that to hold otherwise would be contrary to common sense, it is plainly undesirable that the prosecution should be obliged to keep alive a charge upon which they have no intention of seeking a conviction merely to meet any subsequent attempt to apply the doctrine of autrefois acquit in circumstances which are both technical and without merit.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    85 The Court noted the defect in the charge and concluded at 140: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yet further, applying the principle of the minority judgment of Lush J in  
        Haynes v Davis  
        [1915] 1 KB 332 and of the judgment of the Divisional Court in  
        Broadbent v High  
        [1985] RTR 359 to the facts of the present case, we observe that although the appellant had previously pleaded not guilty to the original charge, the prosecution had determined at or before the hearing of 24 January 1991 to proceed no further upon that charge but to substitute for it the charge of theft. We have therefore come to the conclusion that in no real sense was the appellant ever in jeopardy upon that original charge.” 
        
       
      
    86 In my opinion, this reasoning, particularly in the paragraph identified as 3, is directly applicable to the present case. In the present case the Crown accepted a plea to manslaughter because it could not disprove the alleged provocation, i.e. “the evidence available to the prosecution … [was] insufficient to sustain the conviction”. This is also the proposition from Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley quoted with approval in the three judge judgment in Filipowski quoted above. 
     
      
    87 Where the Crown accepts a plea to manslaughter in full discharge of an indictment for murder the Appellant cannot be said to have been in jeopardy on the murder charge. In such a case there has been no acquittal on the merits. Again, as a matter of substance, the position is equivalent to that which arises on a nolle prosequi. 
     
      
    88 What Dixon J said in Broome v Chenoweth at 599, is also pertinent: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the present case the proceedings had advanced to a stage when it became incumbent upon the prosecutor to support his information by proof, or evidentiary presumption, in order to avoid a dismissal. That being so, I see no reason why the actual order dismissing the information, although expressed to be for want of prosecution, should not amount to a sufficient discharge affording a bar to further prosecution, if the other requirements are satisfied upon which a defence of prior acquittal depends.” 
        
       
      
    89 It cannot be said, in the present case, that “the proceedings had advanced to the stage when it became incumbent upon the prosecutor to support” the charge of murder of the brother “by proof”. 
     
      
    90 In Ward v Hodgkins [1957] VR 715, Herron CJ who, even before the English Court of Appeal had done so, approved the dissent of Lush J in Haynes v Davis, explained Dixon J’s reasoning in Broome v Chenoweth: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour’s whole approach to the matter makes clear, I think, that in order to determine whether the dismissal of an information can be relied upon as the basis for a plea of autrefois acquit, it is necessary to go beyond the dismissal and see how far the proceedings have gone. A dismissal in other words per se may not be sufficient. It may take place before issue joined or before there is any question of an adjudication being embarked upon with regard to the guilt or innocence of the defendant and if it does, it will not in my opinion afford a basis for the plea. In the case before Dixon J, proceedings had advanced to a stage where issue was joined, and an adjudication on the guilt or innocence of the defendant had been embarked on. It was consequently the duty of the Court to go on and determine the case and either convict the defendant or dismiss the information. The defendant was certainly entitled to have the matter determined one way or the other.” 
        
       
       
      (See also  
      Barnes v Gougousis  
      [1969] VR 1019 at 1022.) 
       
      
    91 I note that in Filipowski there was a divergence of view about a passage in Pearce v The Queen at [18]. (See Filipowski at [25]-[30], [38]-[40], [85]-[91] and [95].) Although there does appear to be some tension between the principles identified in the analysis of Gummow and Hayne JJ, with whom Kirby and Callinan JJ agreed in this respect and the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ, it does not appear to me that the proposition approved at [14] in the latter judgment, being the extract from Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley, is contradicted in any relevant respect. Nor does the recent analysis in Washer v Western Australia supra, do so. 
     
      
    92 The passage so approved equated a charge that was technically defective with a situation in which “as a matter of law the evidence available to the prosecution cannot support a conviction”. As noted above, authority to support this proposition was given in the text and one authority was expressly approved in the joint judgment.  
     
      
    93 The formulation so approved appears to me to apply in the present case where the Crown agreed to accept the plea of manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment on the basis that it could not contradict the Applicant’s case of provocation on the material available to it. This was a case in which “as a matter of law the evidence available to the prosecution cannot support a conviction” on the charge of murder of the brother.  
     
      
    94 Although this is a judgment of three judges of the High Court, the absence of any indication in the other judgments of disagreement with the analysis, in this respect, should lead this Court to apply the principle adopted in the joint judgment. That conclusion is reinforced by the fact that in Filipowski it was unanimously decided that the Appellant was not at risk in circumstances where the prosecution had advanced the whole of its case before accepting that on the evidence the charge could not be established.  
     
      
    95 In a sense this could be seen to be a technical defect because the Act expressly stated that the offence creating section did not apply in certain circumstances. However, the actual result in Filipowski could also be characterised in the relevant terms, i.e. the evidence could not support a conviction for that offence.  
     
      
    96 In my opinion, the Applicant was not in legal jeopardy of the charge of murder of his brother. Accordingly, the acquittal of that charge was not an acquittal which could attract the double jeopardy principle. 
     
      
    97 In these circumstances, the breach of the incontrovertibility principle identified above is not sufficient to justify the relief sought by the Applicant. Leave to appeal should be granted on Ground 1 but the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    98 Since writing the above I have read the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in draft. In my opinion, where the principles of finality, double jeopardy and incontrovertibility have been breached the conclusion that there would be an abuse of process follows as a matter of law. To repeat the comment of Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in Carroll at [42]; “the case for a stay of proceedings was irresistible”.  
     
      
       
      The Finality of the Conviction 
       
      
    99 Ground of appeal 2, in the alternative to ground 1, is that his Honour erred by finding that the present proceedings did not controvert the previous conviction of the Appellant for manslaughter. The Applicant originally submitted that there was an inconsistency with the conviction for manslaughter by reason of the fact that it was based on the act of provocation involved in the brother killing their parents. Ultimately, the Applicant’s submissions relied upon the principle of finality, as well as the principle of double jeopardy. 
     
      
    100 This ground of appeal also invoked the findings of fact in the judgment of Abadee J when he sentenced the Applicant for manslaughter. I have already extracted above a number of the references made by Howie J to the judgment of Abadee J in the sentence hearing, especially at pars [123], and [148] set out at [26] and [29] above. 
     
      
    101 In addition, Howie J observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “[112] It will be noted from the facts as tendered that the basis of the plea of guilty was not hat the Crown was asserting that the accused was provoked into killing his brother, but rather that the Crown was unable to prove that he was not provoked. It is trite that, where there is evidence of provocation fit to go to a jury, the Crown must prove to the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the accused person was not provoked into killing the deceased before the jury can convict of murder. In the present case the statement of facts placed before the Judge displayed a clear acknowledgement of the onus and standard of proof. It contained an opinion of the police officer that the accused’s version, that he was provoked by the killing of his parents by his brother, was feasible and that there was no evidence available to refute it. The statement of the prosecutor, which I set out earlier in this judgment, was not an assertion of the facts accepted by the Crown but rather an answer to the Judge’s enquiry as to the basis upon which the plea to manslaughter was being accepted. In my opinion the acceptance of the plea was merely an acknowledgement by the Crown that it could not prove that the accused did not kill his brother under provocation. 
        
       
       
        
        [113] Of course the Judge sentenced the accused on the basis that he was provoked according to his version of events. But that does not mean that the Judge found that version to be the true facts. A sentencing judge is obliged to sentence in accordance with material placed before the court, and, if there had been a jury verdict, in accordance with that verdict notwithstanding that the judge may not agree with it 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [114] Where there has been a trial by jury, the trial judge is required to find facts in accordance with the jury verdict and consistent with the offence of which the accused has been convicted. But apart from these limitations, the trial judge is completely at liberty to find all facts in accordance with the evidence and to the relevant standard of proof: facts adverse to the accused must be found beyond reasonable doubt:  
        Chow v DPP  
        (1992) 28 NSWLR 593. But the finding of facts after a plea of guilty will usually be restricted by the material placed before the court, often being merely an agreed statement of facts: see  
        R v Palu  
        [2002] NSWCCA 381; (2002) 134 A Crim R 174. 
        
       
       
        
        [115] In the present case there was no scope for Abadee J to find any facts other than those that were agreed between the parties notwithstanding that he was not restricted to the agreed statement of facts because other material was tendered to him. But that further material did not impact upon the facts set out in the agreed statement.” 
        
       
      
    102 His Honour referred to a number of authorities including Maxwell v The Queen supra; Walton v Butler [2004] QCA 456; 150 A Crim R 341 and R v K Ex parte Attorney General (Qld) [2002] QCA 260: 132 A Crim R 108. His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[122] Upon this authority it seems to me that the Crown would not be impeded at a trial of the accused for the murder of his parents from asserting that he did not kill his brother under the effects of provocation as a result of the brother killing his parents. Clearly the factual situation here is not on all fours with that decided in  
        R v K  
        because there is still the conviction of manslaughter. But the Crown is not bound by any agreement as to the factual basis for the manslaughter conviction. It is enough that the Crown prove to the jury, that for whatever reason the accused killed his brother, it was not because the brother had killed his parents.” 
        
       
      
    103 His Honour also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[125] The Crown, as in  
        R v K,  
        was prepared to accept, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the factual situation that the accused killed his brother under the effects of provocation and there was hence no occasion for the sentencing court to inquire into or establish what was ‘the truth of the matter’, to borrow that expression from  
        R v K.  
        I do not see whey the Crown cannot at a later trial seek to show that the facts were different from those it was prepared to accept at the sentencing hearing where it conceded that it could not disprove the contrary of those facts. This is in effect what the Crown did in  
        R v K. 
        
       
       
        
        [126] True it is that the accused has been convicted of manslaughter of his brother, but the Crown is not seeking to interfere with that conviction. Nor is it seeking to have the accused convicted of any other offence in respect of the death of his brother. The accused is not being placed in double jeopardy in respect of the death of his brother. There is no question of a plea of autrefois arising nor is there a plea in bar available as a result of the conviction for manslaughter that impact upon this particular prosecution. The fact that the Crown accepted a plea of guilty to manslaughter on the basis of provocation and was prepared to accept that the brother had killed his parents is a matter that may impact upon the jury’s preparedness to find the contrary beyond reasonable doubt. But that is in my view the only relevance of the sentencing proceedings and the conviction of the accused for manslaughter of his brother.” 
        
       
      
    104 With respect to this ground of appeal, the Applicant placed particular reliance on the findings of fact of Justice Abadee in the sentence hearing. For the reasons I have already outlined I do not regard those as pertinent findings. (See also the judgments of the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal relied upon by Howie J: R v K and Walton v Butler supra.) 
     
      
    105 The Crown submitted that the principle of incontrovertibility, which is the way this ground of appeal was expressed, only applied to acquittals and had no application to a conviction. 
     
      
    106 The Applicant relied on some observations by McHugh J in Carroll at 678 to the effect that: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … If subsequent proceedings put at risk the finality of a previous decision involved in an  
        acquittal or conviction 
        , those proceedings are an abuse of process.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
       
      This passage invokes the principle of finality. 
       
      
    107 The principle of finality, expressed in the maxim interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium, reflects the public interest that “judicial determinations be final, binding and conclusive”. (Rogers supra at 273, Pearce supra at [53], Filipowski supra at [41]). The principle of incontrovertibility, expressed in the maxim res judicata pro veritate accipitur has been discussed above. The third principle, bis vexari, in its shortened version, is also discussed in Pearce at [54] and Filipowski at [41]. 
     
      
    108 By the application of the values underlying these three principles the traditional plea in bar of autrefois convict is susceptible to the same extension as the line of authority commencing with Rogers has given to the plea of autrefois acquit.  
     
      
    109 Indeed, in Rogers Deane and Gaudron JJ expressly invoked the principle of incontrovertibility when identifying the common ground between autrefois convict and autrefois acquit. Their Honours said at 276: 
     
      
       
        
        “…to the extent that they prevent the prosecution of crimes for which an accused has either been  
        acquitted or convicted 
        , they prevent inconsistent decisions and serve to maintain the principle embodied in the maxim  
        res judicata pro veritate accipitur.”  
        [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    110 This is similar to the reference to “a defence in the nature of a plea of autrefois convict” in Wemyss v Hopkins (1875) 10 LRQB 374 at 381, as explained in Pearce supra at [18], [21]-[24] as being limited to a plea in bar. However, as I have noted, the critical step taken in Rogers at 255, 280 and in Pearce at [29] was to bring the relevant principles under the rubric of abuse of process. The origins of this development indicate that the principles are applicable to the case of a prior conviction. 
     
      
    111 The Crown submission in this Court that the principle of incontrovertibility does not apply to a conviction should be rejected. 
     
      
    112 When considering whether proceedings which may cast doubt on a conviction constitute an abuse of process which justifies a permanent stay, an analogous approach to that identified in Carroll in the case of a prior acquittal is appropriate. Specifically, where such a doubt or tendency to undermine the finality of a conviction arises only as an “incidental effect” (see Carroll at [50]), the values underlying the applicable principles are not infringed. That, in my opinion, is so in the present case.  
     
      
    113 Any doubt cast on the conviction here would arise only on the basis that the Applicant, if convicted of murder of the parents, should have been convicted of murder of the brother, rather than of his manslaughter. The values underlying the principles of double jeopardy does not apply where, in the hypothesised situation, the Applicant would have benefited from an unduly favourable result.  
     
      
    114 Nor, in my opinion, would the public policy to protect the interests of the administration of justice and the values underlying the principles of finality and incontrovertibility be served by a stay. Where an offender has procured a favourable result by pleading to a lesser charge and, for the reasons discussed above, he was not in jeopardy of a conviction on the more serious charge then, in the case of charges as serious as murder, the interests of the administration of criminal justice are best served by permitting the prosecution to proceed. 
     
      
    115 Leave to appeal should be granted on Ground 2, but the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      The Effect of Delay 
       
      
    116 This ground of appeal is expressed in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erred in finding that appropriate warnings or directions, rulings on admissibility, or other orders would cure any prejudice suffered by the accused, as a result of delay and/or the loss of evidence.” 
        
       
      
    117 The prosecution case against the Applicant is entirely circumstantial. The Crown identified the circumstances upon which it will rely. Howie J set these matters out at pars [30]-[50] of his judgment. There is no challenge to his Honour’s summary and it is unnecessary to repeat it. 
     
      
    118 The Crown identified a number of particular matters which it alleged constituted fresh evidence, including both expert and lay evidence. That evidence is also set out by Howie J at [54]-[62]. Again it is unnecessary to repeat it. Relevantly his Honour concluded at [54] that most, if not all of the evidence would have been available at the time of the first prosecution if it had been sought by investigators. His Honour also indicated that it would be wrong to consider each piece of fresh evidence alone and determine its probative value without regard to the whole of the evidence in the circumstantial case (at [72]-[74]). 
     
      
    119 His Honour also set out the evidence that had been lost. That evidence was substantial including the knife used in the killings, the bloodstained coat of the deceased’s brother, the clothing allegedly worn by the Applicant at the time of the killings, carpet samples from the living room, samples of textile removed from the deceased brother’s coat for forensic testing and swabs that were forwarded for analysis and certain other items. Many of these items were not tested, not least because of the fact that DNA testing was not then as well established as it is now. His Honour outlined this evidence (at [76]-[78]); again it is not necessary to set it out. 
     
      
    120 With respect to the lost evidence, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[84] As I have already noted, the intended prosecution of the accused is a circumstantial case and the Crown is not relying upon the reliability of any particular witness to prove the charges against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Rather the prosecution would be attempting to prove that the account of the accused given at the time of the killings, or very shortly thereafter, could not possibly be true. To this extent the loss of evidence seems to me to have less impact that it might have. True it is that the defence might have used an exhibit now missing or tests carried out on those exhibits to bolster an inference that the accused’s account is true. But the Crown could not rely upon the absence of those exhibits or the lack of testing to support an inference that the accused account was false. This is where I believe that directions or warnings to a jury might be more effective than would be the case where, for example, a complainant in a sexual assault prosecution is an apparently credible and compelling witness. In such a case the jury might more easily be able to dismiss the significance of the lack of evidence in the face of a witness that they feel should be believed. 
        
       
       
        
        [85] The accused complains that the Crown will rely upon evidence of experts who might, because of their expertise, be considered favourably by the jury and yet the accused will not be able to cross-examine them effectively because the exhibits upon which they will express opinions have been lost. The accused is not now in a position to have the exhibits tested by his own experts. But I am not satisfied that this is a matter that cannot be addressed by suitable directions emphasising the lost opportunity of the accused to test the evidence. In any event it appears to me that what the accused has lost is a chance that he might have been able to present evidence that would weigh against the Crown case that his version of the events was false. He has lost an avenue of inquiry, or avenues of inquiry, that may have had a beneficial impact upon his defence:  
        R v Helmling  
        (NSWCCA, unreported, 11 November 1993). That is a matter that appears to me to be appropriately dealt with by directions from the trial judge. 
        
       
       
        
        [86] In  
        R v Slattery  
        [2002] NSWCCA 367 the rifle used in the commission of a shooting offence had been destroyed before defence experts could examine it. The Court of Criminal Appeal set aside the verdict because of a failure of the trial judge to give an adequate warning to the jury, drawing their attention to the possible prejudice to the accused by the inability of the defence to examine the weapon. But there is nothing in the judgment to suggest that, had such a warning been given, the trial would necessarily have been unfair such that the verdict would have been quashed. 
        
       
       
        
        [87] What this decision highlights is the benefit of being able to see with clarity the prejudice to the accused having regard to the evidence actually given at the trial and how, if possible, that might be addressed in light of submissions made to the jury. Otherwise the court in deciding whether there would be such unfairness as to render a trial an abuse of process is left to speculate about the evidence to be led at the trial and to make decisions based upon assertions that might not prove accurate when the issues in the trial are clearly established. This emphasises in my mind the exceptional step of granting a stay on the basis of lost evidence.” 
        
       
      
    121 His Honour’s ultimate conclusion in this respect was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[93] To some extent the accused is in a better position than many accused who face trial after long delay or where evidence has become unavailable. His version of events has been preserved and is accessible in a recorded interview. As I have indicated, the Crown will have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the version he gave shortly after the incident is not true. To that extent the accused is less prejudiced by the passage of time even if he has tried to put the events of the night from his memory. 
        
       
       
        
        [94] Further, it should be borne in mind that the result of a refusal to grant a stay does not mean that the accused is without a remedy, if the trial proves to be unfair notwithstanding steps taken by the trial judge to remove that unfairness. It is not unknown for a trial judge to make a decision based upon a forecast of what might occur during a trial or based upon facts and circumstances as they appear to be at the time the decision is made and yet that forecast prove to have been based upon a false assumption or that the facts or circumstances change significantly during the course of the trial. The trial judge can revisit decisions, such as the refusal to order a separate trial, on the basis of what occurs through the trial. The Court of Criminal Appeal can review such a decision made at he start of the trial if it proves that a miscarriage of justice has ultimately eventuated. This is what occurred in one of the authorities relied upon by the accused,  
        R v Garjee  
        an unreported decision of the English Court of Appeal dated 20 September 1994. 
        
       
       
        
        [95] In the present case I suggested that the prosecutor might indicate what submissions the Crown might make to the jury at any trial in light of the missing exhibits so that a more realistic appraisal might be made of the claim of prejudice by the accused. Ultimately that did not transpire. But it seems to me at this stage that the trial judge can deal with the issue of lost evidence by warnings or directions depending upon how the case develops before the jury and what submissions the Crown ultimately makes. Certainly I am not presently persuaded that the trial judge, by appropriate warnings or directions, rulings on admissibility or other orders, cannot cure any prejudice suffered by the accused, particularly having regard to the fact that it is a circumstantial case and that the Crown must prove that the accused’s version cannot reasonably be true.” 
        
       
      
    122 In my opinion, his Honour was correct to conclude that, with appropriate directions, the Applicant would receive a fair trial and that it was inappropriate for the Court to intervene at this stage. I specifically agree with Howie J, with respect to the lost evidence, that it is appropriate to adopt the approach of this Court in R v Helmling (NSWCCA unreported 11 November 1993). 
     
      
    123 As noted, Howie J concluded that the matters relied upon are capable of being revisited during the course of the trial in order to identify what if any prejudice emerges. I agree. Should there be a trial resulting in conviction, no doubt the actual course of the events together with the actual directions given by the trial judge can be the basis of grounds of appeal with full knowledge of the relevant facts. His Honour was correct, for the reasons he gave, to conclude, in effect, that the application was premature. 
     
      
    124 This Court should not interfere with the decisions of a first instance judge on such matters of practice and procedure. The approach that Howie J has taken to these issues is not only an open one, but is a perfectly reasonable one. There is no warrant for this Court intervening at this stage. Leave to appeal on this ground should be refused. 
     
      
       
      Oppression 
       
      
    125 Ground of appeal 4 is: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erred in failing to find that the further prosecution of the accused is detrimental to the public interest in the light of the delay in the prosecution under reasonable expectation of the applicant that he would not be prosecuted for these two offences.” 
        
       
      
    126 Howie J accepted that, even in the absence of the direct application of a principle of double jeopardy, proceedings may constitute an abuse of process and, accordingly, be vexatious and oppressive because they seek to relitigate a case which has already been disposed of by earlier proceedings. His Honour referred to Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 393 and 396. 
     
      
    127 Of particular significance in this regard were his Honour’s findings on the uncontested evidence of the steps taken with respect to this matter after the Crown had accepted a plea of guilty to manslaughter of his brother in full discharge of murder. The most relevant steps were: 
     
      
    · On 8 June 1995 an inquest was held into the death of the Applicant’s parents before the Deputy State Coroner who concluded, in effect, that the Applicant’s brother had killed his parents. 
     
      
    · The Applicant fell out with other members of his family, it appears over the administration of the parents’ estate. Those family members sought further investigation into the parents’ death which culminated in a television programme in 1997. 
     
      
    · A second police investigation commenced in September 1999 and, ultimately, the matter was referred to the Coroner. 
     
      
    · On 10 April 2000 the Deputy State Coroner commenced a second inquest into the death of the Applicant’s parents. 
     
      
    · On 28 April 2000 that inquest was terminated after the Coroner found that there was evidence capable of satisfying a jury that a known person had committed an indictable offence. As Howie J found, in effect, the Coroner concluded that the Applicant should stand trial for the murder of his parents. 
     
      
    · On 21 July 2000 the Director of Public Prosecutions notified the Applicant that he declined to prosecute him. The basis of this decision was that there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction. 
     
      
    · On 10 May 2000 the Applicant’s uncle commenced a private prosecution of the Applicant for the murder of his parents. 
     
      
    · On 6 June 2001 the prosecution was taken over by the Director of Public Prosecutions and terminated. 
     
      
    · On 13 June 2001 the Applicant was discharged at the Local Court where the prosecutor offered no evidence upon the informations for murder. 
     
      
    · On 22 July 2004 a review of the investigations into the killings was undertaken. 
     
      
    · In October 2004 a re-investigation was commenced into the killing of the Applicant’s parents. A brief of evidence was sent to the Director on 22 November 2005. 
     
      
    · On 21 February 2006 the Director filed an ex-officio indictment which is the subject of these proceedings. 
     
      
    128 In dealing with this issue of oppression his Honour set out the relevant law and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[153] There is little doubt that the accused had a reasonable expectation that the investigation and further prosecution arising from the incidents that occurred on 28 August 1993 were concluded by the acceptance of his plea of guilty to manslaughter. That expectation would have been confirmed by the result of the first coronial inquiry. Thereafter there were occasions when he was in danger of having that expectation frustrated by the findings of the second coronial inquiry or the proceedings commenced by his uncle. However, on each occasion the Director or the Attorney General indicated that a prosecution would not be commenced at that time. 
        
       
       
        
        [154] True it is that the Director has not indicated that a prosecution would never be commenced, but it can be accepted that with the passage of time the accused would have become more confident that no further prosecution was going to occur and gone on with his life in the belief that this part of his past was for all practical purposes over. Of course it is easy to assume his guilt and picture the accused believing that he had escaped punishment for the murder of his parents. But this is where it is important to keep in mind that the court acts upon the presumption of innocence, however strong a prosecution case might appear against an accused person. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [156] However, what is involved is again a balancing exercise considering various public interests not the least being the public interest in the prosecution of persons alleged to have committed serious criminal activity. It is trite to observe that the more serious the offence charged the more heavily will the oppression weight upon the accused to be further prosected but, on the other hand, the more significant will be the public interest in the prosecution continuing. It must be obvious that there is a considerable public interest in the prosecution of an accused person for the murder of two persons, regardless of the relationship of the deceased persons to the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        [157] It is not unreasonable to conclude that the Crown could have prosecuted the accused with all three killings in 1995 on the basis of the supposed similarities in the killings and what other evidence was available to indicate that the accused might have been responsible for all three. At least it could have asked the jury whether there was any reasonable possibility, given the three killings and that the accused admitted to one of them, that he was not responsible for all three. But this is to second-guess the Director. He was entitled to form the view that, even if the case was put on that basis, there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction of the accused for the murder of the parents. If that were the case, then it would arguably have been an abuse of process to put him on trial for the death of his parents. 
        
       
       
        
        [158] It cannot be an abuse of process for the Director to dutifully exercise his functions according to his assessment of the evidence at particular points of time, but ultimately from a different view because he believes that further evidence now makes a prosecution appropriate. I am unable to conclude that it is unreasonable for the Director now to have made the decision to prosecute the accused as the evidence now stands. Although the accused relies upon decisions where a change of the prosecution’s intention has resulted in an abuse of process, those are decisions on their own facts. There is no sense in this case of the prosecution treating the courts ‘as if they were at its beck and call’, see  
        R v Bloomfield  
        [1997] 1 Cr App R 135. It is not a case of the prosecution abusing its power by making repeated attempts to convict the accused of a particular offence such as was the situation in  
        Carroll.  
        It seems to me to be rather a case of the prosecution determining to resist any attempt by any person to prosecute the accused for murdering his parents while the Director was of the view that there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction. 
        
       
       
        
        [159] I am not persuaded that the further prosecution of the accused is detrimental to the public interest notwithstanding the delay and the fact that the accused’s reasonable expectations will be disappointed. It must be said that this is principally because of the seriousness of the allegations and the public interest in them being resolved by a jury in the exercise of the jurisdiction of this Court rather than in its jurisdiction being denied to the Crown. But I also take into account the lack of any suggestion of improper behaviour by the Director or investigating police. While minds might differ as to the quality of the fresh evidence, I am not prepared to hold that it was insufficient to justify the Director’s change of opinion as to the appropriateness of a prosecution of the accused. I am not persuaded to the necessary degree that the exceptional course of staying the proceedings is warranted.” 
        
       
      
    129 The Applicant submits that his Honour’s findings, particularly at [153], [154] and [157] as set out above, are matters which should have led his Honour to the conclusion that the proceedings be permanently stayed. 
     
      
    130 There is a substantial public interest in permitting alleged crimes of such seriousness to be determined on their merits. The expectation, said to be legitimate, induced in the mind of the Applicant by the Crown’s delay and prevarication, is not entitled to significant weight in the case of alleged murder. In my opinion, Howie J correctly found that the events said to result in oppression do not prevail over that public interest, for the reasons he gave. (C/f Filipowski supra at [32].) 
     
      
    131 The balancing exercise which his Honour has undertaken with respect to the alleged oppressiveness of these proceedings is a matter which calls for a broad evaluative judgment on the part of a first instance judge. This Court should be very slow to interfere with a judgment of this character, unless it is satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has occurred or will necessarily occur in the course of a trial. I am not so satisfied. 
     
      
    132 Although the issue which Howie J had to determine was a matter of judgment, rather than the exercise of a discretion, nevertheless, the process of formulating the judgment can be properly described as conferring a wide discretion. (See e.g. Norbis v Norbis (1986) 161 CLR 513 at 518, 540; Russo v Aiello (2003) 215 CLR 643 at [27] and see the analysis in Perpetual Trustee Company Limited v Khoshaba [2006] NSWCA 41 at [34]-[36].) His Honour formed the judgment on proper principles. This Court should not interfere.  
     
      
    133 Leave to appeal on this ground should be refused. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    134 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        1 Leave to appeal on Grounds 1 and 2 granted. 
        
       
       
        
        2 Leave to appeal otherwise refused. 
        
       
       
        
        3 Appeal dismissed. 
        
       
      
    135 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the benefit of reading the draft reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes. I agree with the Chief Justice’s reasons in relation to grounds 3 and 4 of the appeal. However, I will state my own reasons in relation to grounds 1 and 2. 
     
      
    136 To my mind there are two issues which must be resolved. The first is whether the principle of incontrovertibility of previous decisions is engaged in this case. Because incontrovertibility is one of the values protected by the law under the collection of values referred to in the concept of “double jeopardy” it is necessary to consider the essential elements of that concept. Secondly, if incontrovertibility is engaged, it is necessary to consider whether the Court should intervene to stay the prosecution of the applicant for the charge of murdering his parents as an abuse of process.  
     
      
    137 The case raises difficult questions in relation to the operation of our legal system where a person has been either acquitted or convicted of an offence and is later charged with a further offence. The problems are not new although the facts of this case are unusual. The Chief Justice has recorded the essential elements in the judgment of Howie J and the competing submissions and I shall not repeat them in detail. 
     
      
    138 The applicant has not been charged with an offence for which he has already been tried. He was previously charged with the murder of his brother but after entering a plea was convicted of his manslaughter. He is now charged with the murder of his parents. Accordingly the pleas of autrefois convict and autrefois acquit are not available. The applicant’s submission is that the present charges controvert both the previous acquittal on the charge of murdering his brother and the conviction for his manslaughter. It is submitted that the principles of finality of litigation, incontrovertibility of decisions and “double jeopardy” in the sense embodied in the maxim nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa are engaged so that this Court should stay the present proceedings as an abuse of process. 
     
      
       
      “Double jeopardy” – pleas in bar and abuse of process 
       
      
    139 The law has an aversion to placing a person twice in jeopardy of criminal liability arising from a particular event or series of events. As Gaudron and Gummow JJ point out in The Queen v Carroll (2002) 213 CLR 635 at [84] this aversion: 
     
      
       
        
        “… 
        
       
       
        
        finds diverse application through doctrines of estoppel and merger, in the pleas of  
        autrefois acquit  
        and  
        autrefois convict 
         and in principles respecting abuse of process, the admissibility of evidence and sentencing.” 
        
       
      
    140 There are various interests at stake. They extend from the interests of the individuals involved in the event or events to the public interest in maintaining the integrity of and confidence in the justice system. These interests were described by Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Carroll at [86] in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The interests at stake in a case such as the present were discussed in  
        Rogers v The Queen  
        (1994) 181 CLR 251 and in  
        Pearce v The Queen  
        (1998) 194 CLR 610. They touch upon matters fundamental to the structure and operation of the legal system and to the nature of judicial power. First, there is the public interest in concluding litigation through judicial determinations which are final, binding and conclusive (expressed in the maxim  
        interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium).  
        Secondly, there is the need for orders and other solemn acts of the courts (unless set aside or quashed) to be treated as incontrovertibly correct (expressed in the maxim  
        res judicata pro veritate accipitur 
        ). This reduces the scope for conflicting judicial decisions, which would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute (cf  
        Abebe v The Commonwealth  
        (1999) 197 CLR 510. Thirdly, there is the interest of the individual in not being twice vexed for one and the same cause (expressed in the maxim  
        nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa 
        ). Finally, there is the principle that a cause of action is changed by judgment recovered in a court of record into a matter of record, which is of a higher nature (expressed in the maxim  
        transit in rem judicatam) 
        .” 
        
       
      
    141 In Island Maritime Limited v Filipowski (2006) 226 CLR 328 these interests were described by Gummow and Hayne JJ as values described by the expression “double jeopardy.” Their Honours said at [41]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Double jeopardy"" is an expression that is not always used with a single meaning. It is an expression used in relation to several different stages of the process of criminal justice: prosecution, conviction and punishment. It describes values which underpin a number of aspects of the criminal law, rather than a rule that can be stated as the premise for deductive reasoning. The essence of these values is most often seen as captured in  
        three maxims 
        : interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium ( 
        it is in society's interest that there be an end to litigation 
        ), res judicata pro veritate accipitur ( 
        what is adjudicated is taken as the truth 
        ), and nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa ( 
        no one should twice be vexed for one and the same cause 
        ). It is these values that underpin the rule that evidence is inadmissible where, if accepted, it would overturn or tend to overturn an acquittal [ 
        Garrett v The Queen  
        (1977) 139 CLR 437 at 445;  
        Rogers v The Queen  
        (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 277-278;  
        R v Carroll  
        (2002) 213 CLR 635]. It is these values that inform the rules governing successive prosecutions – rules which find their origins in the pleas in bar of autrefois convict and autrefois acquit but now have wider application than those pleas in bar.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    142 There may be little difficulty in determining whether in response to these values the court should intervene to stay subsequent proceedings when a plea in bar of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict is available. Providing the necessary conditions are satisfied those pleas are available as of right. However, as McHugh J pointed out in Carroll the law has more recently recognised that the pleas in bar give only limited protection to an individual (at [129]) and they do not respond to the circumstance where there is the potential for conflict with a judicial determination which may not be immediately apparent from the verdict itself (see also Connelly v DPP [1964] AC 1254). Of course it is otherwise in civil proceedings where the doctrine of issue estoppel has developed. For these reasons the High Court has in a number of cases given consideration to the reach of the protection which should be afforded to prior decisions involving criminal charges. Where appropriate the court will intervene to restrain an abuse of its process (at [131]). 
     
      
    143 The difficulty addressed in the authorities, and it is evident in the present case, is in identifying the determination which cannot be challenged or contradicted. The task is more difficult when decisions are made by juries, as occurs in the criminal law, although of course, only in a minority of cases. Where there is a jury, apart from the ultimate verdict, the decision made by the jury in relation to particular issues will not usually be revealed. Determining whether particular issues were resolved by the jury and how they were resolved will in many cases be impossible (see discussion in Filipowski at [45]). 
     
      
       
      Issue estoppel in the criminal law 
       
      
    144 To address these problems in the criminal law the initial approach of the High Court, adopted in Mraz v The Queen [No 2] (1956) 96 CLR 62, was to accept that a plea of issue estoppel was available in criminal proceedings. The court subsequently rejected that view.  
     
      
    145 In Garrett v The Queen (1977) 139 CLR 437 the appellant was charged with rape. The issue was consent. Evidence was admitted at his trial that he had previously been tried for the rape of the same complainant, when the issue was also consent. He was acquitted at the earlier trial. The High Court, by majority, held that the evidence was wrongly admitted because it would tend to overturn the earlier verdict. Barwick CJ said (at 445): 
     
      
       
        
        “The relevant principle is that the acquittal may not be questioned or called in question by any evidence which, if accepted, would overturn or tend to overturn the verdict. That the applicant was not guilty of the former charge because acquitted of it is a matter which passed into judgment: it is res judicata. It is upon that principle and not upon any issue estoppel that the applicant succeeds.” 
        
       
      
    146 Because Barwick CJ concluded that the principle, now identified as the “incontrovertibility principle” determined the case, his Honour did not find it necessary to consider whether issue estoppel was available in the criminal law. 
     
      
    147 The availability of issue estoppel in the criminal law was rejected by the minority in The Queen v Storey & Anor (1978) 140 CLR 364 (Barwick CJ, Gibbs and Mason JJ) but given qualified acceptance by the majority, (Stephen, Jacobs, Murphy and Aickin JJ) who agreed that it may be available in cases, which may be rare, where an issue could be identified as having been determined in favour of an accused at an earlier trial.  
     
      
    148 The question was again considered in Rogers v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251 where Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ held that the doctrine of issue estoppel as developed in civil proceedings is not applicable to criminal proceedings. Brennan and McHugh JJ took the opposite view. The majority view has now been accepted as authoritative. Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 was decided without further consideration of the availability of the doctrine of issue estoppel in criminal proceedings and the Court did not find it necessary to discuss issue estoppel in Carroll. Gummow and Hayne JJ returned to the question in Filipowski where they accepted that the matter had been authoritatively determined in Rogers. Their Honours said that “it is the values embraced by the notions of double jeopardy that are to be reflected in the development of the criminal law” (at [51]). “To treat the plea of autrefois acquit as yielding no more than a form of issue estoppel does not give effect to all of the values embraced by the notion of double jeopardy” (at [57]). The essence of those values is to be found in the principles in Filipowski (at [41]) to which I have referred. 
     
      
       
      The principle of incontrovertibility and the decision in  
      Carroll 
       
      
    149 Although Garrett was decided in accordance with the incontrovertibility principle the word “incontrovertible” first appeared in the judgment of Deane and Gaudron JJ in Rogers (at 275, 277, 278, 280). It is founded in the principle of finality (Carroll at [48]). The reach of the principle has not yet been authoritatively described. There is no difficulty when it is suggested that there is conflict with a prior verdict where the decision is exposed eg Garrett, Storey. However, in Rogers Deane and Gaudron JJ referred to “the need for decisions of courts, unless set aside or quashed, to be accepted as incontrovertibly correct” (at 273) (emphasis added). Rogers was not concerned with a verdict but rather with the admissibility of a record of interview which had been rejected after argument at an earlier trial. The court held that it could not be tendered at the later trial where a decision to admit it would be at odds with the earlier decision to reject it. The law must protect against “the scandal of conflicting decisions.” (see Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley, The Doctrine of Res Judicata, 3rd edition, 1996). 
     
      
    150 Carroll concerned the prosecution of an accused person for perjury for allegedly lying at his earlier trial. He had been tried for the murder of a child. He gave evidence at the trial when he denied that he killed her. It was later alleged that that evidence was a lie. Gleeson CJ and Hayne J accepted that the principle described by Barwick CJ in Garrett (at 445) that “the acquittal may not be questioned or called in question by any evidence which, if accepted, would overturn or tend to overturn the verdict” is a principle of great width (at [37]; see also Filipowski at [52]). Their Honours further accepted that the principle requires that verdicts of acquittal be “incontrovertible” but they do not define the limits of the principle saying that “it would be unwise to attempt to do so” (at [45]). 
     
      
    151 Their Honours accepted that the protection afforded by the law extends beyond the verdict itself. A further prosecution may be oppressive and an abuse of process “even though there is no direct inconsistency between the new charge and the earlier verdict” (at [47]). Their Honours concluded that where it is argued that the later prosecution seeks to controvert an earlier verdict it is necessary to consider the elements of the relevant offences. They wrote that there is “much to be said for the view that it is necessary to direct attention to the elements of the offence of which the person was acquitted and the elements of the offence with which the person is later charged” (at [47]). Because “it is what is decided in litigation that is final” and cannot be controverted (at [48]), identifying the elements of the offence required to be proved at the first trial will establish the matters which have been decided and will enable a decision to be made at the second trial as to whether the charges may be pursued or particular evidence tendered. 
     
      
    152 Their Honours also accepted that the “[f]inality of a verdict of acquittal does not necessarily prevent the institution of proceedings, or the tender of evidence which might have the incidental effect of casting doubt upon, or even demonstrating the error, of an earlier decision” (at [50]). Their Honours illustrate the point by reference to the tender of similar fact evidence relating to offences of which the accused was previously acquitted. As I understand their reasons, although the verdict in the later trial may be justified or supported by the tender of that evidence, because the verdict relates only to the later charge and does not determine any matter determined in the previous proceedings, that verdict does not have the potential to controvert the earlier decision. There cannot be inconsistent verdicts. 
     
      
    153 In their joint judgment in Carroll Gaudron and Gummow JJ acknowledge an apparent inconsistency between the decision in Garrett and the decision in Storey. The difficulty is the acceptance in Storey that evidence that an accused may have committed an offence of which he had been acquitted may be allowed, but only if the jury is directed not to interpret it in a way which denies the acquittal (Carroll at [92]). Their Honours agreed with the approach of the Chief Justice and Hayne J to the decision in Rogers and Garrett and, although acknowledging the difficulties of similar fact evidence, did not further consider that problem. 
     
      
    154 McHugh J examined the relevant common law principles. Finding that under the common law the judgment of acquittal on the murder charge “was a final and conclusive determination that Carroll did not kill [the girl]” (at [138]) his Honour concluded that a conviction for perjury, where the perjury consisted of the denial that he killed her, would be a direct contradiction and the perjury proceedings should be stayed as an abuse. This conclusion was framed in terms of a direct contradiction although his Honour approved of the potentially wider formulation in Garrett that the acquittal of a person “may not be questioned or called in question by evidence which, if accepted, would overturn or tend to overturn the verdict” (at [138] (McHugh J’s emphasis) and [147]). 
     
      
    155 McHugh J stated the relevant principle was that “[t]he long established policy of the law is that an acquittal is not to be contradicted or undermined by a subsequent charge that raises the same ultimate issue or issues as was or were involved in the acquittal” (at [118]). Adopting the approach of Barwick CJ in Garrett (at 445) his Honour accepted that this policy was necessary for the reason that otherwise “an acquitted person might effectively lose the benefit of the acquittal and the full protection of the double jeopardy principle” (at [130], [138]). 
     
      
    156 The joint judgment of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Filipowski has a detailed discussion of the difficulties faced in the criminal law. A lack of satisfaction that a fact has been proved beyond reasonable doubt does not establish any proposition. Accordingly, issue estoppel has no place. However, their Honours reason that “the refusal to permit the prosecution to have a second opportunity to prove what was found not to have been established at an earlier trial is based in the need to maintain the incontrovertible character of that earlier decision” (at [55]). It is the elements necessary to establish the earlier offence which must be accepted as not having been established. The incontrovertibility principle will be engaged if one or more of those elements is sought to be established at the later trial. 
     
      
       
      The relevance of the incontrovertibility principle in the present case 
       
      
    157 The principles identified in Carroll and Filipowski are relevant to the present case. Before considering the reach of those principles in this case it is necessary to consider whether the applicant was acquitted of the murder of his brother. I address that matter below. Even if acquitted of that murder he cannot raise a plea in bar of autrefois acquit in answer to the charge that he murdered his parents. However, an issue in the earlier proceedings was whether he killed his brother because he was provoked by his brother’s act of killing their parents. That issue was resolved for the purpose of those proceedings, although not after a hearing. The prosecution conceded that it could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant’s brother did not kill the parents. The resolution of that issue does not involve a finding that the applicant did not kill his parents. However, a finding that the applicant did kill his parents would be a finding which could not be reconciled with his acquittal for the murder of his brother.  
     
      
    158 In the same way the acquittal of the accused in Carroll did not require a finding by the jury that he did not kill the child. It may have been that the Crown could not prove to the criminal standard that he did. However, if he was acquitted of murder that matter “passed into judgment: it is res judicata” (Garrett at 445). Having passed into judgment the incontrovertibility principle is engaged. 
     
      
    159 Whether, in the present circumstances, the incontrovertibility principle requires that the present proceedings be stayed raises further matters for consideration. The applicant was neither acquitted of murder nor convicted of manslaughter following the verdict of a jury and a jury was not empanelled for a trial. Does that mean that he was not “in jeopardy” and the plea of autrefois acquit to a charge of murdering his brother was not available? Were there other reasons why he was not “in jeopardy?” If he was not “in jeopardy”, is the consequence that the prosecution for the murder of his parents should not be stayed? Apart from the consequence of the acquittal does his conviction for manslaughter mean that the prosecution for the murder of his parents is an abuse of process which the court should stay? Finally, what if anything follows from the findings made by the sentencing judge? 
     
      
       
      Was there an acquittal? 
       
      
    160 At the time the applicant entered his plea s 394A of the Crimes Act 1900 was in force. That section provides that when a person is arraigned on an indictment for an offence but could lawfully be convicted on the indictment of some other offence “[he] may plead not guilty of the offence charged in the indictment, but guilty of such other offence, and the Crown may elect to accept such plea”. 
     
      
    161 The section was considered in R v Maxwell (1994) 34 NSWLR 606 where Gleeson CJ, with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Badgery-Parker J agreed, said that where s 394A is invoked “[w]hat is involved is not only a conviction of the lesser charge but also an acquittal of the more serious charge” (at 614). 
     
      
    162 Gleeson CJ referred to a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario R v Naraindeen (1990) 75 CR (2d) 120 which was concerned with s 606(4) of the Canadian Criminal Code. That section provided expressly that in the circumstances where the accused pleads not guilty to the offence charged but guilty of another offence “the court shall find the accused … not guilty of the offence charged”. The Chief Justice said at 614 that “for practical purposes I would give the section substantially the same meaning as the Canadian provision”. 
     
      
    163 I agree with Spigelman CJ that nothing turns on the inclusion of an express reference to a finding of not guilty in the Canadian legislation. By qualifying his reference to Naraindeen to its use “for practical purposes” Gleeson CJ was, to my mind, indicating that the proper construction of s 394A had the same practical effect as s 606(4) of the Canadian Code. 
     
      
    164 Maxwell was considered on appeal by the High Court (Maxwell v R (1996) 184 CLR 501) where Gaudron and Gummow JJ said that “[a] conviction for a lesser offence than that contained in an indictment, as permitted by s 394A of the Act, necessarily involves an acquittal on the offence charged in that indictment.” If convicted of manslaughter the accused “can rely on autrefois acquit and cannot now be required to stand trial for murder” (at 529). 
     
      
    165 Gaudron and Gummow JJ speak elsewhere of the nature of the prosecutor’s decision to accept the plea as a decision “not to present evidence on the more serious charge” (at 534) but I do not understand this statement to be referring to the consequence of that decision and whether or not there will be an acquittal. Dawson and McHugh JJ say that “[t]he practical effect of the prosecutor’s acceptance of the plea of guilty to manslaughter was that he led no evidence upon the charge of murder in the indictment” (at 511-512). This was undoubtedly so but I do not understand their Honours to be suggesting that the consequence was that the accused did not have the benefit of a verdict of acquittal. 
     
      
    166 It would follow that the applicant was acquitted of the murder of his brother. 
     
      
       
      Was the applicant in jeopardy? 
       
      
    167 In Filipowski the High Court considered whether a plea of autrefois acquit was available when the defendant had been acquitted of a charge of polluting waters. The original proceedings had resulted in a verdict of acquittal when the trial judge was persuaded that, accepting the prosecution case at its highest, the prosecution must fail. Apart from a defect in the summons, which may have been cured by amendment, because of the location of the ship when it released the polluting discharge the prosecution was bound to fail. It was in state waters but the offence charged was not applicable to state waters. For this reason as a matter of law there was no possibility of a conviction for the offence with which they were charged. There having been no possibility of a conviction the defendants were never relevantly “in jeopardy” and the plea in bar of autrefois acquit was not available. 
     
      
    168 The relevant principles were discussed by Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ. Their Honours said at [11]-[15]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[11] 
         It is not necessary to examine the arguments advanced by the appellants to support the conclusion that a plea of autrefois acquit was available. That is because a key precondition must be satisfied before consideration is given to the principles relating to a plea of autrefois acquit.  
        The defendant must have been in jeopardy on the charge 
          
        Broome v Chenoweth  
        (1946) 73 CLR 583. 
        
       
       
        
        [12] 
         In  
        Broome v Chenoweth  
        (1946) 73 CLR 583 the defendant, an employer, was charged by information with failing to make a compulsory deduction from an employee's wages, contrary to s 221C of the  
        Income Tax Assessment Act  
        1936 (Cth). The defendant had earlier been charged on an information which counsel for the informant had attempted to withdraw because of defects in its form, but which a magistrate instead dismissed. Dixon J held that that order would have been capable of barring the second information on grounds of double jeopardy, but for one difficulty. His Honour said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘[T]here is left the question whether upon the earlier information there could have been a valid conviction. If a conviction in that proceeding could not have been effective, the defendant never did stand in jeopardy upon the earlier charge (1946) 73 CLR 583 at 599.’ 
           
          
         
        Dixon J found that the first information failed to allege two ingredients in the offence. He then said (1946) 73 CLR 583 at 600:  
         
         
          
          ‘The old rule was that, if the defendant could have taken a fatal objection to the earlier indictment or information, his discharge or acquittal thereon could not afford a bar. ""The point in discussion always is whether, in fact, the defendant could have taken a fatal exception to the former indictment; for, if he could, no acquittal will avail him, but if he could not, it is always competent for him to shew the offences to be really the same, though they are variously stated in the proceedings’ (quoting Chitty’s  
          Criminal Law 
          , 1st ed (1816), vol 1, p 455. 
           
           
          In the present instance I think that, unless the information had been amended, the defects I have mentioned are such that a conviction in its terms could not have been sustained.’ 
          
         
         
        [13] 
         Starke J reached the same conclusion. He relied (1946) 73 CLR 583 at 595 on the following passage from  
        Archbold's Criminal Pleadings 
         (31st ed (1943), p 138): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Generally it may be laid down that whenever, by reason of some defect in the record ... the prisoner was not lawfully liable to suffer judgment for the offences charged against him in the first indictment as it stood at the time of its finding, he has not been in jeopardy, in the sense which entitles him to plead the former acquittal (or conviction) in bar of a subsequent indictment.’ 
          
         
         
        [14] 
         These principles have been summarised as follows (Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley,  
        The Doctrine of Res Judicata,  
        3rd ed (1996) p 32, para 59: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘[I]t is essential that the defendant has been in jeopardy on the charge. If summary dismissal occurs because the charge is defective, or because as a matter of law the evidence available to the prosecution cannot support a conviction, the defendant will never have been in jeopardy ... Where the dismissal was not founded upon a consideration of the merits, even in the largest and most liberal sense of that expression, there is no adjudication of the innocence of the accused.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [15] 
         Neither Dixon J nor Starke J doubted that the relevant principles applied as much to summary proceedings on information as they did to prosecutions on indictment (1946) 73 CLR 583 at 595 per Starke J; at 600 per Dixon J. There is accordingly no reason to suppose that those principles do not apply to proceedings such as these, dealt with summarily before the Land and Environment Court in its summary jurisdiction, and the appellants did not submit that they could not. This flows from the fact that a plea of autrefois acquit rests on the rule against double jeopardy, as explained in  
        Pearce v The Queen  
        (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 627-628 per Gummow J; see also at 617 [22] per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ.” 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    169 The procedure followed when the applicant was arraigned for the murder of his brother was that provided by the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Sections 394A and 395 of that Act since replaced by s 153 and s 154 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) provide: 
     
      
       
        
        ”394A Conviction on indictment 
        
       
       
        
        Where a prisoner is arraigned on an indictment for any offence and can lawfully be convicted on such indictment of some other offence not charged in such indictment, he may plead not guilty of the offence charged in the indictment, but guilty of such other offence, and the Crown may elect to accept such plea of guilty or may require the trial to proceed upon the charge upon which the prisoner is arraigned. 
        
       
       
        
        395 Plea of “not guilty” 
        
       
       
        
        If any person arraigned on an indictment pleads thereto “not guilty”, he shall, without further form, be deemed to have put himself upon the country for trial, and the Court shall, in the usual manner, order a jury for his trial accordingly.” 
        
       
      
    170 If, as happened in the present case, the accused although indicted for murder pleads guilty to manslaughter the Crown may, pursuant to s 394A, accept the plea in full discharge of the indictment. In that event a jury will not be empanelled and on the authority of Maxwell the accused will be acquitted of murder and convicted of manslaughter. 
     
      
    171 However, the Crown argues that by following this procedure the applicant was never in jeopardy and a plea of autrefois acquit was not available with the consequence that the incontrovertibility principle was not engaged. Two matters need to be considered. Firstly, could the applicant as a matter of law have been convicted of the charge in the indictment and secondly, had the process reached the point where the applicant was in jeopardy. 
     
      
    172 In Regina v Dabhade [1993] QB 329 the English Court of Appeal considered whether a plea of autrefois acquit was available where a charge was dismissed when the prosecution offered no evidence. The judgment of the court was delivered by Wright J who provided the following four summary propositions at 341: 
     
      
       
        
        “From the foregoing authorities, we have been able to glean the following propositions. 
         
         
        1. For the principle of autrefois to apply, the defendant must have been put in jeopardy. Quite apart from all other requirements, he must demonstrate that the earlier proceedings that he relies upon must have been commenced - that is, by plea in summary proceedings, or by his being put in charge of the jury in a trial on indictment. 
         
         
        2. If, thereafter, a charge or count is dismissed, albeit without a hearing on the merits (e.g. on the basis that the prosecution are unable to proceed), there is a well-established principle that the prosecution may not thereafter institute fresh proceedings on the same or an essentially similar charge or count.  
        Reg. v. Pressick [1978] Crim.L.R. 377 
         is an example of the application of this principle, but in the light of the authorities that we have been referred to, it is by no means clear to us that this is necessarily an application of the principle of autrefois acquit. It is, in our judgment, equally and perhaps more easily to be explained as an exercise of the undoubted jurisdiction in the court to prevent an abuse of its own process: see per Lord Devlin in Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] A.C. 1254. 
         
         
        3. If, however, the summary dismissal of the charge or count is because it is apparent that it is defective, either as a matter of law (e.g. for duplicity) or because the evidence available to the prosecution on any view, given the application of proper legal principles, is insufficient to sustain a conviction on the charge as laid, then, in our view, it cannot be properly said that the defendant has ever been in jeopardy of conviction: see  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v. Porthouse [1989] R.T.R. 177 
         and  
        Williams v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1991] 1 W.L.R. 1160 
        . As a matter of general principle, it does not seem to us to make any difference whether the evidence that the prosecution might otherwise have wished to rely upon is excluded because of some rule of law or statute (as in the Road Traffic Act cases cited) or simply because the evidence on its face is incapable of proving the particulars of the offence alleged. 
         
         
        4. If, moreover, the context in which a charge is summarily dismissed is a rationalisation or reorganisation of the prosecution's case, so that, no doubt in recognition of the difficulties that may lie ahead in the successful prosecution of the original charge, it is decided to substitute therefore a new charge which is regarded as more appropriate to the facts, then the consensual dismissal of the original charge, upon the substitution of the new one, will not give rise to the application of the doctrine of autrefois acquit:  
        Broadbent v. High [1985] R.T.R. 359 
        . Admittedly, the prosecution have not been put to their election; but that is merely because it is at their instance that the new and substituted charge is preferred. Apart from anything else, including the fact that to hold otherwise would be contrary to common sense, it is plainly undesirable that the prosecution should be obliged to keep alive a charge upon which they have no intention of seeking a conviction *342 merely to meet any subsequent attempt to apply the doctrine of autrefois acquit in circumstances which are both technical and without merit.” 
        
       
      
    173 Dabhade was not concerned with the circumstances where a plea of guilty is entered to a lesser charge. The proposition that autrefois is only available when the defendant has been put in charge of the jury in a trial on indictment (proposition 1) reflects the common law. The common law did not allow for a plea of guilty to be entered to a lesser charge than that included on the indictment (R v Hazeltine [1967] 2 QB 857). However, by reason of the statutory provisions in New South Wales in many cases a plea to the lesser charge will be entered after the indictment is presented but before a jury is empanelled. In England the Criminal Law Act 1967 contains a similar provision: s 6(5). When the charge is murder the plea to the lesser charge will result in a conviction for manslaughter. It could hardly be suggested that the accused was not in jeopardy of that charge. As I have indicated, in Maxwell Gaudron and Gummow JJ expressly state that there will also be an acquittal on the murder charge. Their Honours indicate that, although a jury has not been empanelled, provided a conviction for manslaughter has occurred a plea of autrefois acquit to murder will be available (at 529). This must mean that the accused has been in jeopardy of the charge of murder. 
     
      
    174 The point at which a trial on indictment commences in New South Wales has been considered in a number of cases. R v Nicolaidis (1994) 33 NSWLR 364 was concerned with the legislative regime as it was when the applicant pleaded guilty. In that case Gleeson CJ said at 367: 
     
      
       
        
        “The procedure of arraignment is described in  
        Archbold, Pleading, Evidence and Practice in Criminal Cases 
        , 39th ed (1976) par 363 at 155, as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The arraignment of defendants, against whom bills of indictment have been preferred and signed, consists of three parts, (1) calling the defendant to the bar by name; (2) reading the indictment to him; (3) asking him whether he is guilty or not … The arraignment is not complete until the defendant has pleaded.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The effect of arraignment was considered by this Court in  
        R v Howard  
        (1992) 29 NSWLR 242 at 246-250. 
        
       
       
        
        Section 395 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 provides: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘If any person  
          arraigned 
           on an indictment pleads thereto ‘not guilty’, he shall, without further form, be deemed  
          to have put himself upon the country for trial 
          , and the Court shall, in the usual manner, order a jury for his trial accordingly.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The arraignment marks the commencement of a trial by jury. Persons who are tried in the District Court for indictable offences are formally arraigned, in the presence of the jurors in waiting, and immediately before the jury is empanelled. Of course,  
        a jury will only be empanelled if the plea is one of not guilty 
        .” ( 
        emphases added 
        ) 
        
       
      
    175 In R v Janceski (2005) 64 NSWLR 10 Howie J considered the position under the Criminal Procedure Act. Relying on Nicolaidis his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The presentation of an indictment and the arraignment of the accused before the jury panel is a step in the proceedings that marks the commencement of the trial:  
        R v Nicolaidis 
         (1994) 33 NSWLR 362 at 367. But it serves no other purpose and I do not believe that it is a necessary step provided that there has previously been an indictment filed and provided that the accused has been arraigned on  
        that 
         indictment. The proceedings for trial on indictment commence upon the filing or presentation of a valid indictment. When the accused is first arraigned and pleads “not guilty” he is “taken to have put himself or herself on the country for trial”: s 154 of the Act…” 
        
       
      
    176 In the present case the applicant was charged with the murder of his brother. He was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder but guilty to manslaughter. His arraignment marked the commencement of his trial (Nicolaidis) and his plea of not guilty “put him upon the country for trial.” A jury was not required when the Crown accepted his guilty plea in full discharge of the indictment. A verdict of manslaughter was entered and the proceedings were finalised when he was sentenced. In my opinion he was relevantly in jeopardy of the murder charge.  
     
      
    177 Proposition 2 in Dabhade concerns the circumstance where the defendant has been placed in jeopardy but the charge is dismissed without a hearing on the merits. Rather than a plea of autrefois acquit Wright J justified the intervention of the court as the exercise by it of its jurisdiction to prevent an abuse of process. This proposition is consistent with the reasoning of Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ in Filipowski (at [14] and footnote (34)). The joint judgment in Filipowski refers with apparent approval to the statement in Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley that: 
     
      
       
        
        “If a charge is dismissed, albeit without a hearing on the merits, the prosecution may not institute fresh proceedings on the same or an essentially similar charge or count. This may depend on the court’s power to prevent an abuse of process rather than on the plea of autrefois acquit.”([321] p 173) 
        
       
      
    178 This proposition is arguably inconsistent with the statement of Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Maxwell (at 529) to which I have referred in [164] above to the effect that a plea of guilty to manslaughter may give rise to a plea in bar to murder. For present purposes the inconsistency need not be resolved. Whether because a plea in bar is available or relief against an abuse of process, the court is concerned to protect against an inconsistency with the verdict of acquittal. In the present circumstances incontrovertibility depends upon there being a verdict not whether a plea of autrefois acquit is available. 
     
      
    179 Proposition 3, said to contrast with proposition 2, is that a summary dismissal where the charge is defective “either as a matter of law … or because the evidence available to the prosecution on any view, given the application of proper legal principles, is insufficient to sustain a conviction on the charge as laid” the defendant will not have been in jeopardy of conviction. Two cases are identified to support this proposition: DPP v Porthouse [1989] RTR 177 and Williams v DPP [1991] 1 WLR 1160. 
     
      
    180 As I understand proposition 3, Wright J had in mind the circumstance where the evidence available to the Crown, if accepted by the court, could not prove the offence as charged. The proposition does not require an evaluation of the evidence to determine whether it might be accepted; that would be a matter for a trial. If the available evidence could prove the charge as pleaded but the proceedings are dismissed because the jury could not be satisfied of the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt, the dismissal will found a plea of autrefois acquit. 
     
      
    181 It was upon this third proposition that the defendant failed in Filipowski. In that case the prosecution evidence tendered at the first trial, even if accepted, could not prove the offence charged. The ship from which the pollutant was discharged was not in waters to which the charged offence applied. Accordingly, as a matter of law a conviction could not be sustained. The evidence on its face, taken at its highest, was incapable of proving the offence alleged (see Dabhade at 341). 
     
      
    182 The joint judgment approves the summary of the principles from [59] of Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley’s text, which is quoted in the extract from Filipowski set out [34] above.  
     
      
    183 The learned authors of Spencer Bower, Turner and Handley cite as authority for the proposition contained in the second sentence of their summary, the decision in Dabhade, in particular the passage at 341. The relevant passage is: 
     
      
       
        
        “3. If, however, the summary dismissal of the charge or count is because it is apparent that it is defective, either as a matter of law (e.g. for duplicity) or because the evidence available to the prosecution on any view, given the application of proper legal principles, is insufficient to sustain a conviction on the charge as laid, then, in our view, it cannot be properly said that the defendant has ever been in jeopardy of conviction: see  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v. Porthouse 
         [1989] R.T.R. 177 and  
        Williams v. Director of Public Prosecutions 
         [1991] 1 W.L.R. 1160. As a matter of general principle, it does not seem to us to make any difference whether the evidence that the prosecution might otherwise have wished to rely upon is excluded because of some rule of law or statute … or simply because the evidence on its face is incapable of proving the particulars of the offence alleged.” 
        
       
      
    184 At first glance there may appear to be little difference between the passage from Dabhade and that from [59] of the text. Upon closer inspection there is a difference of significance. 
     
      
    185 The text outlines two situations in which there is no legal jeopardy. The first is where “the charge is defective”. The second is where “as a matter of law the evidence available to the prosecution cannot support a conviction”. These are expressed as two independent grounds. The enquiry in the first is as to defects in the charge (with no guidance as to the limits of what will constitute a defect); the enquiry in the latter is as to a lack of evidence in support of the charge such that “as a matter of law” no conviction could follow.  
     
      
    186 The passage from Dabhade expresses the overall enquiry as being directed to whether “it is apparent that [the charge] is defective.” That is the test. The passage goes on to outline where a charge may be considered to be defective, giving two grounds. First, it may be defective “as a matter of law”. Second, it may be defective “because the evidence available to the prosecution on any view, given the application of proper legal principles, is insufficient to sustain a conviction on the charge as laid”.  
     
      
    187 The difference between the text and decision in Dabhade lies in the use in the text of the phrase “as a matter of law” not as a separate ground of defectiveness in relation to the charge, but as a standard to which any insufficiency of evidence must rise for legal jeopardy not to be found, with no enquiry as to the charge itself being defective. It is, of course, necessary to read the text mindful of the primary material upon which it relies.  
     
      
    188 Gleeson CJ, Heydon and Crennan JJ, in footnote (34) to [14] in Filipowski, express their approval of the passage from [59] in the text. However, their Honours were aware of the authority upon which the writers of the text rely. This is apparent from their Honours’ reference in footnote (34) to the comments of Rougier J in Williams at 1170 as support for the passage from the text. Williams, and the cases to which it refers, reveal that, as Dabhade suggests, the evidentiary enquiry in relation to legal jeopardy is ultimately focused on the presence of prima facie defects in a charge. The relevant passage from Williams referred to in Filipowski reads as follows (at 1170):  
     
      
       
        
        “Turning to the qualitative question [in relation to legal jeopardy], I am of the opinion that the situation in the present case is much more closely comparable with that in  
        Director of Public Prosecutors v. Porthouse 
         [1989] R.T.R. 177 and in  
        Jelson (Estates) Ltd. v. Harvey 
         [1983] 1 W.L.R. 1401. Realistically, the reason whereby the defendant escaped conviction on the first hearing was because the prosecution had framed the charge incorrectly and, by referring to the specimens of breath rather than blood, had put themselves out of court when it came to proving the charge of how much alcohol the defendant had consumed. Assuming, as one is entitled to do, that the matter had ultimately been decided according to correct legal principles, the defendant could never have been convicted. It follows, therefore, in my view, that he was never in jeopardy within the meaning of the phrase as applicable to the doctrine of autrefois acquit.”  
        
       
      
    189 The factual situations considered in Williams, Porthouse and Jelson (Estates) Ltd v Harvey [1983] 1 WLR 1401 respectively are instructive for understanding the import of the above passage from Williams.  
     
      
    190 In Williams, the defendant had undergone a roadside breathalyser test, which proved positive. He had then been taken to a police station and had given two samples of breath into an intoximeter, testing over the legal limit on both occasions, but in the case of one sample to a low enough extent that he was entitled to require a specimen of blood to be taken as well, a right which he exercised. The relevant legislation provided that, where a sample of blood had thus been taken, the breath specimens were not available for use in any subsequent proceedings against the defendant. In spite of this, the summons issued was framed in terms of the breath test results. At the hearing, a preliminary objection was taken by the defendant’s solicitor to the summons, leading to the dismissal of the summons and the later bringing of a fresh summons, which this time referred correctly to the blood specimen. The conclusion of Rougier J, with which Taylor LJ agreed (at 1171-2), was as set out in the passage at 1170 quoted above, namely that the defendant could never have been convicted on the first summons, and hence was not in legal jeopardy, “because the prosecution had framed the charge incorrectly and, by referring to the specimens of breath rather than blood, had put themselves out of court when it came to proving the charge of how much alcohol the defendant had consumed”.  
     
      
    191 This conclusion is clearly directed towards a fundamental defect in the charge as laid; the evidence of the breath specimens upon which the charge was founded was, due to its unavailability and irrelevance given the blood specimen, such as could never have led to a conviction. Rougier J considered (at 1170) that this situation in Williams was closely aligned to those of Porthouse and Jelson. In Porthouse, an information preferred against the defendant was found at the hearing to be defective and was substituted with an alternative information. The defect in the first information had been to cite s 5 of the Road Traffic Act 1972 (UK) as its basis, but at the same time to phrase its particulars in terms of both ss 5 and 6 of that Act. The substituted information correctly referred to s 6 alone and was phrased in acceptable terms. An election was made to proceed on the second information, leading to the dismissal of the first. The basis of the judgment of the court (delivered by May LJ) was as follows (at 182): 
     
      
       
        
        “In these circumstances, we prefer to rest our decision in the instant case upon the proposition that the first information was so faulty in form and content that the defendant could never have been in jeopardy upon it and thus its dismissal could not give rise to any defence of autrefois acquit on the second information.” 
        
       
      
    192 Once again, this decision is directed towards the finding of a defect in the charge or information itself. In Jelson too, enquiry was directed towards a defect in a notice of motion brought by Jelson (Estates) Ltd, by which it sought committal of Harvey, the defendant, for contempt of a court order. The notice of motion as originally brought failed to comply with procedural requirements by omitting to state the particular breaches the subject of the complaint. No order was made at the hearing in relation to the motion, with neither the supporting evidence nor the merits of the claim being considered. A second notice of motion was served, which complied with procedural requirements. The defendant objected to the hearing of the second motion on the grounds of double jeopardy, Goulding J ruling against the defendant on the objection. On appeal, Cumming-Bruce LJ, with whom Dillon LJ agreed, considered that the reasoning of Lush J in his minority judgment in Haynes v Davis [1915] 1 KB 332 was authoritative in the circumstances. Lush J had concluded that, in determining legal jeopardy, one must look to whether the first matter was determined on the merits. In particular, Lush J referred (at 339) to the expression “acquittal on the merits” as involving: 
     
      
       
        
        “[the] antithesis to a dismissal of a charge upon some technical ground which had been a bar to the adjudicating upon it. That is why this expression is important, however one may qualify it, and I think the antithesis is between an adjudication of not guilty upon some matter of fact or law and a discharge of the person charged on the ground that there are reasons why the court cannot proceed to find if he is guilty.” 
        
       
      
    193 The situation in Jelson, as described by Cumming-Bruce LJ (at 1410), was that Warner J, the judge hearing the first notice of motion, “observed the irregularity on the notice of motion and decided that it would be wrong, that is to say unfair, to proceed to adjudicate on the merits when the grounds had not appeared from the notice of motion so that the defendant had not had the time specifically to consider those grounds”. And as Dillon LJ stated (at 1411), “the technical point was taken for the defendant and was rightly acceded to by Warner J., that the notice of motion failed to comply with the rules and should not be investigated; it should be dismissed out of hand, as it was. It seems to me that he was never in jeopardy because the point was firmly taken and accepted by the judge at the outset of the hearing. The merits were never gone into.” 
     
      
    194 It is a situation such as existed in Jelson that must have been contemplated by Lush J when discussing “reasons why the court cannot proceed to find if [a defendant] is guilty” (emphasis added). The word “if” is crucial. The issue is not that the court cannot proceed to find a defendant guilty (that is, to weigh the merits of the evidence); the issue is that the court cannot proceed to find if a defendant is guilty (that is, even to consider the merits of the evidence). A consideration such as that imports the sort of circumstances found in Jelson, where a defect in the motion meant (in the words of Dillon LJ above) that it “should not be investigated”. It further accords with the factual scenarios in Williams and Porthouse, where there existed defects in the framing of the relevant charge or information that removed both the necessity and the opportunity for any consideration of the merits.  
     
      
    195 In my opinion it is necessary both to read the conclusion reached in Williams and to read [59] of the text in this light. That reading is not in conflict with Filipowski. In Filipowski the evidence in relation to the discharge was such that no conviction could ever follow; discharge into the particular body of water to which the relevant section of the legislation applied was not capable of being demonstrated on any reading of the evidence, leading to a prima facie defect in the proceedings. The court could not proceed to consider the question of guilt, as the charge as laid, in the context of the evidence available, was simply insupportable.  
     
      
    196 In the present case there is no suggestion of any defect in the indictment or that the applicant “was not liable to suffer judgment” for the offence of murder. It was not suggested that the evidence available to the prosecution could not “as a matter of law” support a conviction. All that occurred was the concession made by the Crown that the quality of the available evidence would not enable a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was not provoked by his brother’s conduct in killing their parents. The position is quite different to Filipowski where the available evidence taken at its highest could not prove the offence as charged. 
     
      
    197 For these reasons I am satisfied that the applicant was relevantly in jeopardy when acquitted of the murder of his brother. 
     
      
       
      The conviction for manslaughter 
       
      
    198 Irrespective of whether the acquittal of his brother’s murder gives rise to a verdict which the law will protect, the applicant was convicted of his brother’s manslaughter. The essential elements determined by that verdict were that he intentionally killed his brother but did so under the provocation occasioned by his brother’s act of killing their parents. But for the provocation the applicant would have been guilty of murder. 
     
      
    199 The applicant entered a plea of not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. He was convicted of the latter. Whatever be the position in relation to the acquittal it could not be suggested that he was not in jeopardy of conviction for his brother’s manslaughter. 
     
      
    200 Just as the law will protect a verdict of acquittal it will also protect a verdict of conviction. In Rogers Deane and Gaudron JJ said at 276: 
     
      
       
        
        “To the extent that they prevent the prosecution of crimes for which an accused has either been acquitted or convicted, they prevent inconsistent decisions and serve to maintain the principle embodied in the maxim res judicata pro veritate accipitur.” 
        
       
      
    201 There will be cases where the later proceedings, although not amenable to a plea in bar, will undermine or tend to undermine the integrity of the previous verdict of conviction. The present case is one illustration. The applicant was convicted of manslaughter and received a sentence with the greatest degree of leniency. The verdict was founded on his explanation that he only killed in circumstances of extreme provocation. A verdict of guilty for killing his parents would demonstrate that the original verdict was based upon a false premise and tend to indicate that the applicant was guilty of the murder of his brother. 
     
      
    202 In Carroll McHugh J refers to “the finality of a previous decision involved in an acquittal or conviction” (at [145]). There is no reason why the principles which have developed from the originally confined notions of double jeopardy should not extend to convictions. Both the interests of the individual and the public interest in maintaining confidence in the legal system require it. 
     
      
       
       
      The sentencing hearing 
       
      
    203 The remaining question is the consequence, if any, of the “findings” made by the sentencing judge. Howie J was of the view that although the sentencing judge had sentenced, as he was required to do, having regard to the agreed facts, this did not mean that he found them to be true. The facts agreed and provided to the sentencing judge indicated that the applicant came upon his brother who was in the process of igniting the body of their mother having previously stabbed both of them many times causing their deaths. Those facts necessarily excluded the applicant from being the killer of the parents. 
     
      
    204 However, there was no verdict acquitting the applicant of the killing of his parents. Furthermore, he has never been in any sense “in jeopardy” for the alleged killing by him of his parents. The sentencing judge was precluded from considering that possibility by the agreed facts. 
     
      
    205 Although sentencing proceedings require the sentencing judge to determine the relevant facts beyond reasonable doubt, it is for a limited purpose. The available evidence will either have been tendered at the trial, in which case the jury will have returned a verdict, or will be tendered at the sentencing hearing following the acceptance by the prosecution of a plea. In either case the decision making function of the judge is confined. If there has been a trial the judge must make findings consistent with the jury’s verdict. If a plea has been entered, but the relevant facts are in dispute, the findings must nevertheless accord with the plea. If the facts are agreed the judge’s determination will be confined by that agreement. 
     
      
    206 Although the limits of the principle of incontrovertibility have not been settled, informed by the values to which I have referred, I see no reason why facts “found” in the sentencing process should be elevated so that they cannot be controverted in other proceedings. Those facts are not “found” for the purpose of a finding of guilt or innocence but rather for the purpose of establishing the culpability of an offender where a jury has found him to be guilty of the offence charged or he has acknowledged his guilt of that offence by entering a plea. 
     
      
    207 The view that the incontrovertibility principle does not operate in relation to findings of fact in the sentencing process is most readily accepted where, as in the present case, the facts are found without a contested hearing. In that circumstance the court has not been asked to determine between competing versions of events or make its own finding. The role of the judge has been confined to acceptance of the evidence agreed by both parties. 
     
      
    208 Although it is no longer a relevant consideration this analysis confirms the difficulties which the doctrine of issue estoppel would give rise to if adopted in criminal proceedings. A concession by the Crown that it was the brother who killed the parents may found an estoppel in civil proceedings. However, criminal proceedings which include the sentencing process have a distinct character requiring the development of a separate body of principles. The view which I have come to is consistent with the decision of the Court of Appeal in Queensland in R v K; Ex parte Attorney General (QLD) [2002] QCA 260; (2002) 132 A Crim R 108. 
     
      
       
      Is there an abuse of process? 
       
      
    209 My analysis leads to the conclusion that the principle relating to the incontrovertibility of previous decisions is engaged in the present case. The factual basis for both the applicant’s acquittal for the murder of his brother and conviction for his manslaughter are in conflict with his prosecution for the murder of his parents. However, the question remains whether there is an abuse of process warranting a permanent stay of proceedings. 
     
      
    210 In 1861 Cockburn CJ said in R v Elrington (1861) 121 ER 870 at 873: 
     
      
       
        
        “[We] must bear in mind the well established principle of our criminal law, that a series of charges shall not be preferred, and whether a party accused of a minor offence is acquitted or convicted, he shall not be charged again on the same facts in a more aggravated form.” 
        
       
      
    211 Over a century later in Connelly v DPP [1964] AC 1254 Lord Devlin said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, therefore, the principle stated by Cockburn CJ … necessarily goes beyond the principle of autrefois. I consider it very desirable that the two principles should be kept distinct, for one gives the defendant an absolute right to relief and the other only a qualified right … I prefer the modern development of this principle, which justifies it by  
        the power to stop vexatious process 
        . This, to my mind, is the true principle that is to be extracted from Cockburn CJ’s statement of the law and the one that I think should be applied in the criminal law as it is in the civil.” (at 1358) (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    212 In the same case Lord Pearce said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The above cases show that a narrow view of the doctrines of autrefois acquit and convict, which has at times prevailed, does not comprehend the whole of the power on which the court acts in considering whether a second trial can properly follow an acquittal or conviction. A man ought not to be tried for a second offence which is manifestly inconsistent on the facts with either a previous conviction or a previous acquittal. And it is clear that the formal pleas which a defendant can claim as of right will not cover all such cases. Instead of attempting to enlarge the pleas beyond their proper scope, it is better that the courts should apply to such cases an avowed judicial discretion based on the broader principles which underlie the pleas.” 
        
       
      
    213 In DPP v Humphrys [1977] AC 1 Lord Salmon said that the opinions of Lord Devlin and Lord Pearce “constituted powerful authority” for the exercise of the inherent power to prevent the abuse of process in the context of criminal proceedings (at 45-46).  
     
      
    214 To similar effect Lord Edmund-Davies said: 
     
      
       
        
        “While judges should pause long before staying proceedings which on their face are perfectly regular, it would indeed be bad for justice if in such fortunately rare cases as  
        Reg v Riebold  
        [1967] 1 WLR 674 their hands were tied and they were obliged to allow the further trial to proceed. In my judgment,  
        Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions  
        [1964] AC 1254 established that they are vested with the power to do what the justice of the case clearly demands … “ (at 55) 
        
       
      
    215 Although the development of appropriate principles in England has not been without controversy (see Lord Morris in Connelly at 1300-1304 and Viscount Dilhorne in Humphrys at 26) the position is now settled in Australia: see Williams v Spautz (1992) 174 CLR 509; Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378; Rogers at (255-256, 286-287); Pearce at [115]-[117] per Kirby J. 
     
      
    216 Abuse of process is not confined to the use of court processes for ulterior purposes but extends to proceedings which are vexatious or oppressive (Rogers at 255 per Mason CJ; Williams v Spautz at 520). The circumstances in which abuse of process may arise are varied and are not confined to those recorded in the decided cases (Rogers at 255-257 per Mason CJ). 
     
      
    217 There are a number of considerations. In Walton Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said that to determine whether criminal proceedings should be stayed as an abuse of process for litigating a case which had already been disposed of by earlier proceedings involved balancing: 
     
      
       
        
        “[t]he requirements of fairness to the accused, the legitimate public interest in the disposition of charges of serious offences and in the conviction of those guilty of crime, and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.” (at 396) 
        
       
      
    218 See also Rogers (at 256 per Mason CJ and at 286 per McHugh J). 
     
      
    219 There are factors which favour the Court intervening to restrain an abuse of process. The submission that the applicant murdered his parents contrasts directly with the basis upon which the earlier verdicts were founded. A conviction for the murder of his parents would raise an inconsistency between the verdicts. Although that inconsistency will not be apparent on the face of the verdicts it is nevertheless a situation which the incontrovertibility principle seeks to avoid. It does not seem to me to matter that the earlier verdicts were more favourable to the applicant than they might have been. This is almost inevitably the case: see Carroll. 
     
      
    220 The second factor which weighs in favour of this Court’s intervention is the recognition by the principles developed under the expression “double jeopardy” of the need to provide to the accused the full benefit of an earlier acquittal. It can be argued that that objective cannot be met if the jury in the contemplated trial is to be asked to make a finding which cannot be reconciled with the earlier verdicts. 
     
      
    221 It will be inevitable that at the applicant’s trial the jury will learn of the death of the brother as well as the parents. The applicant’s defence must be that he was not present when they were killed but came later to the scene and after his brother had killed them. Counsel will no doubt raise the fact that he has been acquitted of his brother’s murder but convicted of his manslaughter. The reason for those verdicts will inevitably be disclosed, the jury being told that the Crown could not negative provocation. If the applicant was to have the full benefit of the acquittal for his brother’s murder he could not be convicted of killing his parents. 
     
      
    222 Notwithstanding the obvious force of these submissions I have come to the conclusion that this is a case where this is not an abuse of process requiring the Court’s intervention. One important consideration is that the earlier verdicts were entered without a hearing on the merits of the Crown case. When the incontrovertibility principle is raised in circumstances where the apparent inconsistency is with an assertion made by the accused in earlier proceedings which has not been tested, the justification for protecting the earlier decision from contradiction is significantly diminished. It would of course be different in civil proceedings where issue estoppel could be pleaded. There will be no difficulty in accepting that a prosecution for the murder of the brother would either be barred as of right, a plea of autrefois acquit being available, or the Crown, having accepted the plea, the proceedings should be stayed as an abuse of process. A person should not be placed in jeopardy for an offence of which he has been acquitted or a like offence arising from the same facts as those in evidence at the earlier trial (Filipowski at [49]). However, when the prosecution is for an entirely separate offence it cannot be reasonably suggested that the accused is being harassed by the prosecutor. 
     
      
    223 It would be unwise to attempt to identify the range of circumstances where, notwithstanding that the principles of incontrovertibility are engaged, further proceedings will be an abuse of process requiring the intervention of the Court. However, when in the present case the charge is murder, the most serious known to the criminal law, the public interest in the prosecution of the alleged offender must prevail over concerns as to the potential for inconsistencies between the verdict and the previous verdicts entered without a determination by the court of the charges on their merits (Connelly at 1364). Public confidence in the administration of justice requires the prosecution to proceed.",2007-11-25 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Mr Saadat-Talab appeals the decision of a Local Court magistrate dismissing an application by him under s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (“the State Act” and s 32 may be referred to as “the State provision”) for diversionary orders on account of his mental illness.  
     
      
    2 The learned magistrate was dealing with three charges against Mr Saadat-Talab that he threatened to cause serious harm to a Commonwealth public official; that he caused harm to a Commonwealth public official; and that he was obstructing a Commonwealth public official. These are offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The learned magistrate determined that the State provision did not apply to crimes under the Commonwealth Code and could not, therefore, be utilised.  
     
      
    3 The learned magistrate took the view that the provisions of s 20BQ (“the Federal provision”) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (“the Federal Act”) applied to the situation with which he was dealing to the exclusion of the State provision. The guilt or innocence of Mr Saadat-Talab and most of the facts with which the learned magistrate must deal are irrelevant to this appeal. This appeal is confined to the issue of law involving the relationship between the State provision and the Federal provision, being whether both provisions apply or only the Federal provision applies. It is necessary to give some factual background.  
     
      
    Facts 
     
      
    4 The necessary facts may be stated briefly. Mr Saadat-Talab alleges that he converted from Islam to Christianity while in Iran, as a consequence of which he says he fears persecution in Iran. He applied for a Protection Visa in Australia, which was refused. He applied on a number of occasions to the relevant Minister of the Commonwealth for intervention pursuant to s 417 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). The Minister either refused to intervene or refused to consider intervention (the distinction being irrelevant for present purposes). He was detained at Villawood Detention Centre.  
     
      
    5 The above occurred between 2000 and 2004. In 2002, Mr Saadat-Talab sewed his lips together and participated in a hunger strike. He was eventually medicated with anti-depressants. At the time he wrote to the relevant Commonwealth Department referring to his situation and his loss of everything as having turned him “mentally ill”. In May 2002 the Departmental officer at Villawood Detention Centre remarked: “he seemed a little depressed.” This was four months after sewing his lips together and engaging in the hunger strike.  
     
      
    6 Mr Saadat-Talab participated in proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia and was unsuccessful. Notwithstanding its success in the proceedings, the Australian Government allowed Mr Saadat-Talab to re-apply for a Protection Visa, which he did.  
     
      
    7 For the purpose of such a visa, a medical clearance and interview were necessary and granted or undertaken. The medical clearance was granted on 20 July 2004. The interview occurred on 27 July 2004. On 10 September 2004 Mr Saadat-Talab’s representative wrote to the Department seeking the urgent issue of a visa (at least a temporary visa) on account of his deteriorating mental health.  
     
      
    8 On 27 September 2004, the incident giving rise to the charges occurred. It was a scuffle. It is not suggested that any serious harm was occasioned. There were some scratches to the faces and arms of two security officers, who were comfortable to finish the shift and, it seems, required only minor attention and no leave.  
     
      
    9 It seems Mr Saadat-Talab was injured in the incident from which he was taken in a wheelchair and attention given to his shoulder.  
     
      
    10 The day after the incident ASIO notified the Department that Mr Saadat-Talab had a security clearance to remain in Australia and the day after that (29 September 2004) the Minister granted him a Temporary Protection Visa. As a consequence Mr Saadat-Talab is not currently in detention.  
     
      
    11 A consultant psychiatrist, Dr Ryan, attested before the learned magistrate that Mr Saadat-Talab had a Major Depressive Illness at the time of the incident. Based upon his expertise and clinical notes (and other objectively proven facts) Dr Ryan concluded that his mental illness at the time of the incident “was of such severity that his mental functioning was impaired by virtue of a severe disturbance of mood and seemingly irrational behaviour” and that he would have, at the time, benefited from admission to hospital.  
     
      
    12 Dr Ryan also noted that, at the time of the hearing, Mr Saadat-Talab was not suffering mental illness of the same or similar severity and it did not impair his mental functioning.  
     
      
    13 Evidence was adduced before the learned magistrate of significant community support for Mr Saadat-Talab and of his employment prospects.  
     
      
    14 It was conceded by Mr Saadat-Talab that he did not, at the time of the hearing before the Local Court, suffer a mental illness.  
     
      
    15 One of the alleged differences between the operation of the State provision and the Federal provision is that the State provision allows diversionary orders where a mental illness was suffered at the time of the incident, whereas, it is submitted that the Federal provision applies only in circumstances where the mental illness is suffered at the time of the hearing. It is necessary to set out the relevant provisions.  
     
      
    The Legislation 
     
      
    16 There are four most relevant provisions. They are the State provision (s 32 of the State Act), the Federal provision (s 20BQ of the Federal Act), and ss 68 and 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). They are relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
      State Act:  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act  
      1990

        “32(1) If, at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate, it appears to the Magistrate:  
         
          
          (a) that the defendant is (or was at the time of the alleged commission of the offence to which the proceedings relate):  
           
            
            (i) developmentally disabled, or  
             
            (ii) suffering from mental illness, or  
             
            (iii) suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital,  
            
           
          
          
           but is not a mentally ill person within the meaning of Chapter 3 of the

          0 
          , and  
           
          (b) that, on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the Magistrate may consider relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law,  
           
          the Magistrate may take the action set out in subsection (2) or (3).  
          
         
        (2) The Magistrate may do any one or more of the following:  
         
          
          (a) adjourn the proceedings,  
           
          (b) grant the defendant bail in accordance with the  
          Bail Act 197 
          8 
          ,  
           
          (c) make any other order that the Magistrate considers appropriate.  
          
         
        (3) The Magistrate may make an order dismissing the charge and discharge the defendant:  
         
          
          (a) into the care of a responsible person, unconditionally or subject to conditions, or  
           
          (b) on the condition that the defendant attend on a person or at a place specified by the Magistrate for assessment of the defendant’s mental condition or treatment or both, or  
           
          (c) unconditionally…. 
          
         
        (4) A decision under this section to dismiss charges against a defendant does not constitute a finding that the charges against the defendant are proven or otherwise.  
         
        (4A) A Magistrate is to state the reasons for making a decision as to whether or not a defendant should be dealt with under subsection (2) or (3).  
         
        (4B) A failure to comply with subsection (4A) does not invalidate any decision of a Magistrate under this section.”

        “20BQ(1) Where, in proceedings in a State or Territory 
         
          
          before a court of summary jurisdiction in respect of a federal offence, it appears to the court:  
           
          (a) that the person charged is suffering from a mental illness within the meaning of the civil law of the State or Territory or is suffering from an intellectual disability; and  
           
          (b) that, on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings, or such other evidence as the court considers relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the person under this Division than otherwise in accordance with law;  
           
          the court may, by order:  
           
          (c) dismiss the charge and discharge the person:  
           
            
            (i) into the care of a responsible person, unconditionally, or subject to conditions, for a specified period that does not exceed 3 years; or  
             
            (ii) on condition that the person attend on another person, or at a place, specified by the court for an assessment of the first-mentioned person's mental condition, or for treatment, or both, but so that the total period for which the person is required to attend on that other person or at that place does not exceed 3 years; or  
             
            (iii) unconditionally; or

            (i) adjourn the proceedings;  
             
            (ii) remand the person on bail;  
             
            (iii) make any other order that the court considers appropriate.  
            
           
          
         
        (2) Where a court makes an order under paragraph (1)(c) in respect of a person and a federal offence with which the person has been charged, the order acts as a stay against any proceedings, or any further proceedings, against the person in respect of the offence.  
         
        (3) Where a court makes an order under subsection (1) in respect of a person and a federal offence with which the person has been charged, the court must not make an order under section 19B, 20, 20AB or 21B in respect of the person in respect of the offence.”

    17 The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions submitted below that s 20BQ of the Federal Act operates to exclude the operation of s 32 of the State Act and, inter alia, because Mr Saadat-Talab was not, at the time of the hearing before the learned magistrate, suffering from a mental illness (within the meaning of the civil law) no diversionary order could be made. Mr Saadat-Talab, as earlier stated, submits here, and submitted below, that both the State provision and the Federal provision relevantly operate and provide an available discretion to be exercised by the learned magistrate.  
     
      
    18 The judgment below determined that s 32 of the State Act did not provide an available discretion and that Mr Saadat-Talab was not, at the time of sentencing, suffering from a mental illness within the meaning of the civil law of the State. The learned magistrate confined the meaning of mental illness to the meaning ascribed to that term in the Mental Health Act 1990 and described the submission, made on behalf of Mr Saadat-Talab, that the term included the meaning within the common law as “fanciful”.  
     
      
    Does the State Provision Apply? 
     
      
    19 The commencement of any analysis is the terms of s 32 of the State Act. In its current form, the State provision applies to allow a magistrate not to convict and sentence a person who has (or had at the time of the alleged commission of the offence) a mental condition (i.e. something broader in scope than a mental illness). In that regard the magistrate has the power to deal with the person “otherwise [than] in accordance with law” and is for that reason referred to as a diversionary order.  
     
      
    20 Mr Saadat-Talab submits that s 32 of the State Act of its own force operates to provide the magistrate with jurisdiction. This submission, also made below, was put formally but no elaboration of the proposition occurred.  
     
      
    21 The Director of Public Prosecutions submits that s 32 of the State Act must be understood as relating only to State offences and not federal offences. It is, the Director submits, “a long recognised rule of statutory construction that a reference to courts, matters, things and persons in the legislation of a State is a reference to courts, matters, things and persons in that State”: Solomons v District Court of NSW [2002] HCA 47; (2002) 211 CLR 119 at 138 [37] per McHugh J.  
     
      
    22 That general proposition is promulgated in the Interpretation Act 1987, s 12(1). But the general proposition needs some consideration in its application to this provision. The State provision deals with the discretion of a magistrate. The application of the general proposition would mean that it was referring only to magistrates “in and for New South Wales”. But it is New South Wales magistrates that are exercising the relevant federal jurisdiction. Further the “mentally ill” person is also a person in and of New South Wales. It seems, therefore, that the Director of Public Prosecutions is suggesting that the limitation derives either from the use of the term “offence” or that the limitation operates as if it read “in and of the judicial power exercised by virtue of the jurisdiction conferred by New South Wales”. This is a refinement of the general rule of some moment. It applies a rule derived from the presumption of territorial limits to a rule presuming that general powers given to officers of the State (judicial or otherwise) do not relate to any exercise beyond the “body politic”. This is not the same as a presumption, or rule of construction, limiting or construing powers granted to those within legislative power.  
     
      
    23 There may be such a limitation. If there were not, then the State provision would apply and questions would arise under s 109 of the Constitution. It may be, because of the manner in which the matter has been agitated, that I misunderstand the submission. There has been no or no substantial argument on this question and, in those circumstances, I ought not decide the question. Because of that which follows, it is unnecessary to decide it.  
     
      
    24 One of the reasons that the above argument seems academic is that there is federal legislation: both the Federal Act and the Judiciary Act. Section 68(1) of the Judiciary Act has the effect of “picking up” the State provision and applying it to persons charged with offences against the Commonwealth.  
     
      
    25 It is not in issue, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions quite properly conceding the point, that s 32 of the State Act is a provision (leaving aside the effect of s 20BQ of the Federal Act) that is applied by s 68 of the Judiciary Act. Nevertheless, in order to deal with the effect of s 20BQ of the Federal Act, it is necessary to examine how s 68 operates.  
     
      
    26 Section 68 of the Judiciary Act applies certain laws of the State. Those laws are laws respecting arrest and custody of offenders or persons charged with offences. It applies laws of that kind respecting the procedure for summary conviction (which this proceeding was). This must include, as the Director of Public Prosecutions concedes, the procedure for not proceeding to conviction under s 32 of the State Act.  
     
      
    27 By operation of s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act, the Local Court of New South Wales has jurisdiction with respect to the summary conviction of persons under laws of the Commonwealth.  
     
      
    28 Returning to the provisions of s 68(1), the laws described in [26] above, apply and are applied, “so far as applicable” “to persons” charged, inter alia, with the offences and proceeded against in the Local Court.  
     
      
    29 The expression “as far as possible” is the subject of authority. The High Court has discussed it in a number of cases, the most recent and most relevant discussion being in Putland v R [2004] HCA 8; (2004) 218 CLR 174. There the High Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[4] Section 68 of the  
        Judiciary Act 
         provides, so far as presently relevant, that the laws of a State or Territory respecting the arrest and custody of offenders or persons charged with offences, and the procedure for their trial and conviction on indictment, shall apply and be applied so far as they are applicable to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth in respect of whom jurisdiction is conferred on the several courts of that State or Territory by the section. The operation of related provisions of s 68 concerning appeals was recently considered by this Court in  
        R v Gee 
        . The background to the section is the obvious circumstance that State and Territory laws concerning the matters to which the section relates may differ. The necessary consequence is that, in certain respects, those differences will apply as between federal offenders, depending upon where they are tried. In the present case, the sentencing judge was exercising jurisdiction conferred by s 68(2). Northern Territory laws respecting the procedure for trial and conviction on indictment were at least potentially picked up and applied as federal law by s 68(1). Sentencing laws come within that description. In  
        Leeth v The Commonwealth 
        , Mason CJ, Dawson and McHugh JJ referred to an observation by Dixon J that s 68 disclosed a policy ‘to place the administration of the criminal law of the Commonwealth in each State upon the same footing as that of the State’ and that it was ‘no objection to the validity of such a provision that the State law adopted varies in the different States’. They continued:  
         
         
         
          
           
            
            ‘Thus the administration of the criminal law of the Commonwealth is organised upon a State by State basis and there may be significant differences in the procedures applying to the trial of a person charged with an offence against a Commonwealth law according to the State in which he is tried. And if a person is convicted of a federal offence and sentenced to a term of imprisonment, he will ordinarily serve that term in a State prison in the State in which he is convicted. Prison systems differ significantly from State to State, but that is something which, in relation to federal offenders, is contemplated by s 120 of the Constitution.’  
            
           
          
         
         
        … 
         
         
        [7] The laws of a State or Territory to which s 68(1) refers apply ‘so far as they are applicable’ Although there is not in s 68, as there is in s 79 of the  
        Judiciary Act 
        , an express qualification to the operation of the provision by the use of the words ‘except as otherwise provided by the  
        Constitution 
         or the laws of the Commonwealth’ in the context of a problem such as the present there is little, if any, functional difference between the two forms of qualification. The meaning of ‘otherwise provided’ was considered in  
        Northern Territory v GPAO 
        . Relevantly for present purposes, s 52 of the  
        Sentencing Act 
         would not be picked up and applied by s 68 if a Commonwealth law expressly or by implication made contrary provision, or if there were a Commonwealth legislative scheme relating to the sentencing of the appellant which was ‘complete upon its face’ and can ‘be seen to have left no room’ for the operation of s 52. Since the appellant relies upon both kinds of other provision, it is necessary to examine in some detail the Commonwealth laws that are said to have that effect.” ( 
        Putland 
        , supra, 
          
        per Gleeson CJ at 178-179) 
        
       
      
    30 Likewise the joint judgment of Gummow and Heydon JJ in Putland accepted the understanding of the parties that s 68(1) is to be read as if “as a matter of express statement rather than implication, there was a qualification for provision otherwise made from time to time by the laws of the Commonwealth”: (Putland at [41], per Gummow and Heydon JJ with whom Callinan J agreed).  
     
      
    31 By operation of s 68(1) of the Judiciary Act, the relevant state laws become laws of the Commonwealth. There is no room for the operation of s 109 of the Constitution. Therefore any repugnancy or inconsistency must be approached from the aspect that it is s 68 and the other Commonwealth law that is inconsistent and not from the standpoint that the other Commonwealth law prevails because there is an inconsistency with a State law: see University of Wollongong v Metwally [1984] HCA 74; (1984) 158 CLR 447 at 463 per Mason J.  
     
      
    Are section 68 of the Judiciary Act and section 20BQ of the Crimes Act (Cth) inconsistent? 
     
      
    32 Insofar as s 68(1) of the Judiciary Act purports to make s 32 of the State Act a law of the Commonwealth, it does so by governing a class of persons, to whom it then applies the regime in s 32 of the State Act. That class is any person who is or was suffering a mental illness but “is not a mentally ill person within the meaning of Chapter 3 of the Mental Health Act 1990”. 
     
      
    33 On the other hand, s 20BQ of the Crimes Act (Cth) applies only to a person who “is suffering from a mental illness within the meaning of the civil law of the State”. A person who is mentally ill within the meaning of Chapter 3 of the Mental Health Act is, at least, part of the class of persons defined by the term “mentally ill” “within the meaning of the civil law of the State”. 
     
      
    34 What is “the civil law of the State”? If, as decided by the learned magistrate, the term were confined to persons governed by the Mental Health Act, then, expressly, s 20BQ of the Crimes Act (Cth) applies only to such persons and s 68(1) of the Judiciary Act, in applying s 32 of the State Act, expressly, does not apply to such persons. 
     
      
    35 Therefore, if the learned magistrate be correct in her construction of the meaning of “civil law” in this context, there can never by an inconsistency between any operation of s 20BQ of the Crimes Act (Cth) and s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act. The former applies to defined mentally ill persons; the latter applies to those who are not. The world, in logic, consists of “X” and “not X”, which are opposites. In this case the class of “mentally ill persons” consists of those governed by the Mental Health Act and those that are not. The sub-classes are mutually exclusive and the sections, in questions here, deal with each sub-class.  
     
      
    36 But is the learned magistrate correct in limiting “mentally ill” in that way? And does it make a difference? The term “civil law” may have a number of meanings depending on the context. It may describe the system of law, other than the common law system, deriving from Roman Law. Given that no Australian State operates under the civil law system, it cannot have that meaning. The term “civil law” may be, and in my view on this occasion is, used to describe the law of private or civil rights, as opposed to the criminal law. In this use, depending on context, it may or may not include public rights and duties in administrative law. It is unnecessary to deal with that question.  
     
      
    37 Mr Saadat-Talab submits that, if, as I have determined, the proper construction of s 20BQ of the Crimes Act (Cth) is that the term “civil law” includes the common law as well as statutory provisions, then Mr Saadat-Talab fits the meaning of “mentally ill” within the common law. Counsel cites, as an example, a person suffering a mental condition as a result of a traumatic event caused by the negligence of another. 
     
      
    38 For the reasons that follow, it is unnecessary to determine the extent of the definition. However, I make the following comments. It is, in my view, very different to refer, in legislation of this kind (s 20BQ of the Crimes Act (Cth)) to “mental illness” than to refer to an injury including a disease. A traumatic injury may cause a “mental illness”. Certainly, for example, some negligently caused birth defects may be so described. But it is an altogether different proposition to that which is advanced on behalf of Mr Saadat-Talab. “Mental illness”, even under the common law, seems a narrower concept than mental or psychiatric injury. The latter may or may not seriously impair mental functioning and that “mental impairment” criterion seems at the core of “mental illness”. I do not finally determine this issue. 
     
      
    39 Lastly, and most importantly in determining the issues in these proceedings, I deal with whether, as the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) submits, s 20BQ of the Crimes Act (Cth) is a “code”. This submission is essentially that the Commonwealth, having prescribed a method of diverting punishment in some cases, should be taken to have excluded diversionary orders in others: see Saraswati v R [1991] HCA 21; (1991) 172 CLR 1 at 23-24; Anthony Hordern & Sons v Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia [1932] HCA 9; (1932) 47 CLR 1 at 7; Leon Fink Holdings Pty Ltd v Australian Film Commission [1979] HCA 26; (1979) 141 CLR 672 at 678.  
     
      
    40 The difficulty with such a submission is that the term diversionary order is a common abbreviation of the effect of the order. But orders under these sections (ss 20BQ and 32) are not the only means whereby a person suffering a mental disorder (whether at the time of sentencing or commission of the offence) may avoid conviction for an offence committed: s 19B of the Crimes Act (Cth) allows extenuating circumstances that affected the commission of the offence to be a factor in not recording a conviction. That a person was suffering a mental disorder at the time of the commission of an offence must be a factor considered under s 19B or otherwise in determining an appropriate sentence: see Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476-477 (per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ). Therefore, s 20BQ of the Crimes Act (Cth) does not purport to be the exclusive means of either dealing with mental disorder (a broader term than mental illness) or with utilising mental disorder in determining, notwithstanding “guilt”, not to proceed to convict.  
     
      
    41 Lastly, is the above construction one which accords with the disclosed purpose of the legislature: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [78]? Does its provisions, as construed, give effect to harmonious goals: Project Blue Sky, supra, at [70]? 
     
      
    42 In introducing s 20BQ of the Crimes Act (Cth) the Minister said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The primary purpose of the Crime Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 is to review the Commonwealth sentencing legislation and the laws governing Federal offenders found unfit to be tried or not guilty on the grounds of mental illness.  
         
         
         
        … 
         
         
         
        The Bill provides a new regime for dealing with persons who are found unfit to plead, or unfit to be tried or not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. Sentencing courts are also being given additional options for persons who are mentally ill or intellectually disabled. The Bill gives magistrates courts greatly increased options when dealing with cases summarily. Hospital orders will be available in lieu of imprisonment, where mental illness has contributed to the commission of serious offences. Special bonds will also be available psychiatric probation orders for mentally ill offenders, and program probation orders for intellectually disabled offenders. The new sentencing options of hospital orders and bonds give effect to the Australian Law Reform Commission’s recommendations.” (Second Reading Speech, The Hon. Robert Brown, 5 October 1989, for the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989) 
        
       
      
    It seems that the intention of the Parliament was to give additional powers and extend the options available to magistrates.  
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    43 Section 68 of the Judiciary Act grants to the learned magistrate the jurisdiction and/or power to deal, under s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, with persons suffering a mental disorder at the time of the commission of an offence. Her Honour was entitled to deal with Mr Saadat-Talab by making one or more of the orders described in s 32, if the learned magistrate were otherwise satisfied of the criteria, described in that section, for the grant of such orders.  
     
      
    44 Section 20BQ of the Crimes Act (Cth) does not expressly or impliedly affect the operation of the jurisdiction so conferred, but is an additional source of power available in different circumstances.  
     
      
    45 Even if the circumstances overlap, which in my view they do not, the jurisdiction granted by s 20BQ of the Crimes Act (Cth) is additional to that granted by s 68 of the Judiciary Act in its application of s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    46 The Court makes the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) Pursuant to Part 51B Rule 5(5) of the Supreme Court Rules, time for the filing of the summons be extended to include the date of its filing; 
       
       
      (ii) Pursuant to s 53(3) of the  
      Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 
      , leave to appeal be granted; 
       
       
      (iii) The decision of her Honour Magistrate Huber LCM given on 22 December 2006 in relation to the application of Mr Saadat-Talab under s 32 of the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
       be set aside; 
       
       
      (iv) The matter be remitted to the Local Court for determination in accordance with law; 
       
       
      (v) The defendant shall pay the costs of and incidental to these proceedings, as agreed or assessed; 
       
       
      (vi) Any party has liberty to apply on the form of these orders or on the question of the issue of costs; 
       
       
      (vii) Otherwise the proceedings be dismissed.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      1. On the afternoon of Monday, 27 November 2006, Michael Hamilton had been drinking. He was drunk and stressed. He came upon Brendan Meares in the street. Mr Hamilton was in a car. For some reason, they started arguing. Mr Hamilton, having grabbed Mr Meares by the scruff of the neck yelling, ""What is your fucking problem?"", punched Mr Meares with his right fist to the left temple area. The stunned Mr Meares was standing there when Mr Hamilton repeated the assault, this time punching him in the face causing his nose to bleed. 
       
       
      2. Mr Hamilton came before the Local Court charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. This is an offence contrary to s 59(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      . The learned magistrate took a dim view of what had happened. He sentenced Mr Hamilton to 9 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months. I can understand that sentence because Mr Hamilton has been before the Courts before. 
       
       
      3. For a young man who has just turned twenty, he does not have a good record. He committed various offences  
      such as theft before he was eighteen and was dealt with by the Children's Court. More significantly, since he has turned eighteen he was convicted of a common assault in 2005 and was given the benefit of a bond under s 9 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      . He breached that bond. He was called up and received a 100 hours community service order. In addition, he was in 2006 convicted of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order. He got another community service order. He was convicted of larceny in May 2006 and, significantly, received another s 9 bond. That bond was for a period of 2 years.  
       
       
      4. It follows that at the time Mr Hamilton took it upon himself to assault Mr Meares, he had been extended conditional liberty by the justice system. The magistrate at Inverell Local Court, in sentencing him for larceny, had given him a chance and released him on the bond as I said. 
       
       
      5. Mr Hamilton has appealed to me against the sentence imposed for the assault on Mr Meares. Mr O'Connor, who appears for Mr Hamilton, asks for a s 9 bond. As a fall-back position, he asks for a suspended sentence under s 12 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
      As a last resort, he asks for periodic detention.  
       
       
      6. He put his client in the witness box. His client gave evidence about a number of things. The following were significant. First, he explained the offence by drink and stress. Secondly and significantly, he went to prison as a result of the magistrate's order. He commenced serving his sentence. He spent some 17 days in prison and was moved about the State to different correctional centres. He spent time in Tamworth, Cessnock, Parklea, Bathurst and Oberon. After 2 weeks he decided he would appeal from the sentence and he was granted bail. 
       
       
      7. The period of 17 days obviously had a significant impact upon him. When asked by his counsel about it, he broke down and cried in the witness box and was clearly upset. He explained about receiving threats in prison and being very scared. Another thing he mentioned in evidence is a diagnosis which had been made around July 2007, that is half a year after the offence, of bipolar disorder. I accept his evidence that he has been so diagnosed and is being treated for that condition. 
       
       
      8. He has a partner and they have a 2 year old son. Mr Hamilton lives in Glen Innes with his parents and his partner lives separately in Glen Innes looking after their son. He is still friends with the victim and could not explain why this assault occurred. Other evidence presented by Mr O'Connor on behalf of his client include character references which I have read. 
       
       
      9. Mr Hamilton clearly has a good work history and is well regarded as an employee. There is a letter from the victim, Mr Meares. The only part of that letter to which I attach some weight is that Mr Meares records that Mr Hamilton was sincerely apologetic about what happened. I accept that because Mr Hamilton confirmed that in evidence in the witness box, and the police facts tendered by the prosecution record that Mr Hamilton approached Mr Meares and apologised for assaulting him. Evidently his first apology was when they were in hospital after the event. Mr Hamilton was in hospital because he hit Mr Meares so hard that he fractured some bones in his hand. 
       
       
      10. There is a letter from Mr Meares' current employer. He has recently secured employment in Guyra at a tomato farm. The prosecution tendered a pre-sentence report. It records that a community service order is not available because Mr Hamilton has been convicted of an offence of violence. It does record, however, that he is eligible and has been assessed as suitable for a periodic detention order. He would serve that in the periodic detention centre at Tamworth. 
       
       
      11. The question for me is what is the appropriate sentence to impose upon Mr Hamilton. As I said, Mr O'Connor's first proposition was that I should give him the benefit of a bond. I do not accept that submission despite the advantage, which Mr O'Connor says, that it will require supervision. I reject the submission for two reasons: the first is that Mr Hamilton has had the benefit of bonds before from the court, and the second is that he has in the past breached bonds and, even more significantly, when committing this offence, he was clearly in breach of the good behaviour bond which he received from the court for larceny. 
       
       
      12. A community service order is not an available option. Mr Hamilton's record indicates the need for personal deterrence to feature in his sentence.  
       
       
      13. To my mind, I am left with little option but to impose a term of imprisonment. The question for me is how that term of imprisonment should be served. In accordance with s 5 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      , I am not satisfied, having considered alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. In my opinion, either periodic detention or a suspended sentence is appropriate. I say this having reached the view, as I said, that a sentence of imprisonment is the only option which is left. 
       
       
      14. I do not regard full-time imprisonment as appropriate partly because of Mr Hamilton's age; he is just 20. I also take into account the fact that he has spent 17 days in full-time imprisonment and it has had a significantly deterrent effect upon him. I regard his prospects of rehabilitation as good. He has ceased drinking alcohol almost totally. He is clearly a good employee and is currently in employment. He has good references and appears determined to deal with his diagnosed condition of bipolar disorder. 
       
       
      15. He has pleaded guilty to this charge and he will receive the benefit of that plea. Given the fact that he is a young man with a young family and is in regular employment, I regard periodic detention as the less desirable option and a suspended sentence as a more desirable option as the way in which he should serve his sentence of imprisonment. I would regard a sentence of 12 months as appropriate but because of his plea of guilty, and other subjective facts, I would reduce that to 9 months. 
       
       
      16. I impose a sentence of imprisonment of 9 months on you. I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of the period. I make that order under s 12(1) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
      I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for a term of 9 months. The good behaviour bond will have the following conditions: 
       
       
        
         
         1) you will appear before the court if called upon to do so at any time during the bond, 
          
         2) during the term of the bond you will be of good behaviour, 
          
         3) you must notify the court of any change in your residential address, 
          
         4) you are to subject yourself to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and accept their reasonable directions in particular relating to the treatment of your bipolar disorder. You are also to accept any reasonable directions which the service gives about drug and alcohol rehabilitation. 
          
         
        
       
       
        I direct you to report to the office of the Probation and Parole Service at Glen Innes on or before next Friday, 5 October 2007.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR:  
     
      
       
      The Issue 
       
      
    2 The issue arising is whether the second defendant (the magistrate) erred in law when he decided he lacked jurisdiction to deal with three prosecutions against the first defendant (Ms Stevens) for negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. The argument concerns the date when a Court Attendance Notice (“CAN”) was filed in the Local Court at Sutherland. 
     
      
       
      The Background 
       
      
    3 On 5 January 2005 three people were injured in a motor vehicle accident at Telegraph Point, near Port Macquarie. It is alleged by the plaintiff that the injuries were brought about by Ms Stevens’ driving, and that she was guilty of three offences of negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm contrary to section 42(1)(b) Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. 
     
      
    4 The maximum penalty for an offence against section 42(1)(b) Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act is, in the case of a first offence, 20 penalty units ($2,200) or imprisonment for nine months or both. The offence is to be dealt with summarily in the Local Court: section 6(1)(c) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. On the state of the law at that time, where an offence was to be dealt with summarily, the CAN had to be served and filed in the Local Court where the matter was to be heard, within six months of the events giving rise to the offence. Thus, here, the last day was 5 July 2005. Otherwise the Local Court had no jurisdiction to hear the matter.  
     
      
    5 Although no evidence was called on this issue, the prosecutor told the magistrate this: on 2 June 2005 the investigating police officer, Senior Constable Bentley, prepared a CAN in respect of each alleged offence. On the same day he posted copies of each CAN to Ms Stevens and to Sutherland Local Court. Evidence before the magistrate suggests the CANs arrived at Sutherland Local Court on 9 June 2005. The return date for the CANs was 4 August 2005. 
     
      
    6 On 3 August 2005 copies of each CAN were made by an employee at Sutherland Local Court from electronic records. Those documents, dated 3 August 2005, were placed on a court file. 
     
      
    7 On 4 August 2005, the proceedings were mentioned before the magistrate and by consent adjourned to 15 September 2005. Although Ms Stevens was not present or represented that day, there was a letter on her behalf on the court file, apparently requesting an adjournment so that representations could be made. On 15 September 2005 the proceedings were again adjourned by consent, this time to 29 September 2005. On 29 September 2005 they were adjourned to 27 October 2005.  
     
      
    8 On 27 October 2005 Ms Stevens was represented by counsel, Mr B Murray. Before the magistrate, counsel submitted (and the learned magistrate accepted) that the court had no jurisdiction, since the CANs were required to be filed within six months from the date of the alleged offences, whereas the only copies of the CANs on the court file were the ones dated 3 August 2005, a date well outside the statutory period. Consistently with Barns v Edwards (1993) 31 NSWLR 714 the magistrate marked all three CANs “No jurisdiction”. There was a subsidiary argument that the police officer had not complied with a requirement that he endorse the original versions of the CANs with Ms Stevens’ address at which he served her. But since the magistrate found he had no jurisdiction, he did not decide that issue. 
     
      
    9 Since the magistrate did not dismiss the proceedings, there was no “dismissal” against which the plaintiff could appeal under Part 5 Division 2 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001: Director of Public Prosecutions v Cakici & Anor [2006] NSWSC 454 at [34]; Sharman v Director of Public Prosecutions & Anor [2006] NSWSC 135; (2006) 161 A Crim R 1 at [44]; 12; Barns v Edwards at 720B.  
     
      
    10 The plaintiff seeks orders in the nature of certiorari and mandamus in respect of the magistrate’s determination, pursuant to section 69(1)(c) Supreme Court Act 1970. However, there is no need for certiorari where there has been a refusal to exercise jurisdiction: Brygel v Stewart-Thornton [1992] 2 VR 387 at 391. 
     
      
    11 Relief in the nature of mandamus may be granted where there has been a constructive failure by the magistrate to exercise the Court’s jurisdiction: R v War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal; Ex parte Bott (1933) 50 CLR 228 at 242-243. 
     
      
    12 Both defendants filed submitting appearances. The only appearance on the hearing before me was on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Director having, on 18 June 2007, taken over prosecution of the proceedings pursuant to section 9(1)(c) Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986. 
     
      
       
      Orders Sought in the Summons 
       
      
    13 The prosecutor claims here: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. An order that the record of the Local Court, sitting in its criminal jurisdiction at Sutherland on 27 October 2005, in the proceedings Police v Rebecca Amy Stevens for three offences of “Negligent Driving Occasioning Grievous Bodily Harm” be called up, and the determination of the Second Defendant on that day, that he was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceedings, be quashed. 
        
       
       
        
        2. A declaration that the Second Defendant fell into jurisdictional error in that he failed to consider material that was relevant to his determination. 
        
       
       
        
        3. A declaration that the Second Defendant fell into jurisdictional error in determining that he was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        4. An order that the proceedings be remitted to the Local Court to be determined according to law. 
        
       
       
        
        5. An order that the First Defendant pay the Plaintiff’s costs of and incidental to this summons. 
        
       
       
        
        6. Such further or other order as to the Court seems fit.” 
        
       
       
      Legislative Background 
       
      
    14 Section 172(1) Criminal Procedure Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Proceedings for an offence are to be commenced in a court by the issue and filing of a court attendance notice in accordance with this Division”. 
        
       
      
    15 Where the prosecution is commenced by a police officer, (as here) section 173 provides relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “If a police officer … is authorised to commence proceedings for an offence against a person, the officer may commence the proceedings by issuing a court attendance notice and filing the notice in accordance with this Division.” 
        
       
      
    16 Section 175 sets out the requirements for a CAN, including that it be in writing and contain particulars of the alleged offence. 
     
      
    17 Sections 177, 178 and 179, as at the relevant time, provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        177 Service of court attendance notices 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) A court attendance notice issued by a police officer must be served by a police officer in accordance with the rules.

    18 Part 4 of the Local Courts (Criminal and Applications Procedure) Rule 2003 (“the Rule”) contains provisions about service and proof of service of a CAN.  
     
      
    19 Rule 37(2) requires the person serving the CAN to endorse on a copy of the served CAN certain details of service including: 
     
      
       
        
        “(e) if the document was served by post, the manner in which the person was informed of the address to which it was posted and the time and place of posting.” 
        
       
      
    20 It is to be noted that (e) does not require endorsement of the address used for service, merely “the manner in which the person was informed of the address …”. 
     
      
    21 The final piece in the legislative setting is Rule 60, which says: 
     
      
       
        
        “60 Filing of documents 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) A document that is required by the  
          Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
           or the  
          Local Courts Act 1982  
          or this Rule to be filed in the registry of a Court or with the registrar by a police officer or public officer is taken to be filed if dealt with as follows: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) the document is sent by post to the registry of the Court, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (4) A document that is required by the  
          Criminal Procedure Act 1986  
          or the  
          Local Courts Act 1982  
          or this Rule to be filed in the registry of a court is, except with the leave of the registrar, to be filed in the registry of the Court before which the relevant proceedings are, or are to be, listed.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (Rule 60 was not, it appears, drawn to the magistrate’s attention during the hearing before him, but that did not lead to any error. The magistrate proceeded on the assumption that filing by posting a copy to the relevant Local Court was appropriate.) 
       
       
      The Hearing Below 
       
      
    22 As I have noted, on 3 August 2005 copies of each CAN were generated by an employee at Sutherland Local Court from electronic records. The date they were generated, viz 3 August 2005, appeared on them. 
     
      
    23 Before the Local Court, Mr Murray contended that the CANs were out of time; that “the earliest that the court attendance notice existed is 3 August which is more than six months after the offence.” T 1, lines 55-57 For that argument he relied on the fact that the earliest printed forms of CAN on the court file were ones of that date. 
     
      
    24 The prosecutor then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This incident occurred in Port Macquarie, so the officer in charge of Port Macquarie instructs me that on 2 June 2005 he printed the relevant charge sheets from this matter. After he printed them the defendant’s copies were put into an envelope and addressed to her residential address and he instructs me that they were posted to her on that day. Another defendant’s copy was sent to Mr Murray. 
        
       
       
        
        The Court bench copies were put in another envelope and addressed to the Clerk of the Local Court at Sutherland. The prosecutor’s copies were put into an envelope and then just sent through to our office through internal mail. So my instructions from the informant are that he, in fact, posted as per the requirements, those relevant charge papers to the defendant at her residential address and also to Mr Murray. It appears that Mr Murray has not received that and I assume that the defendant has not either, certainly not these ones that the informant indicates were generated on 2 June.” 
          
          
        T 4.17 
        
       
      
    25 The prosecutor handed two documents to the magistrate. One was a computer-generated record concerning the CANs. The record was from within the Local Court computer system, but the “enquiry” which caused it to be printed was from within the Police Service. Under the heading “Processing Details”, this appears on the document: 
     
      
       
        
        “Date Issued: 02/06/2005”. 
        
       
      
    26 Under the heading “Record of Processing” this appears: 
     
      
       
        
        “28/07/05 1 Record Transferred from Police 
         
         2 First Hearing: THU, 04/08/2005”. 
        
       
       
      From a note at the top right corner of the page it appears the document was produced from a computer system on 27 October 2005. 
       
      
    27 The other document was a CAN containing an endorsement of service suggesting service of it had occurred on 2/6/05 when Senior Constable Bentley sent a copy of it by mail to Ms Stevens at the address she had given police. At the lower right hand corner this appears: “Printed at 3:54 pm on 02/06/2005”. 
     
      
    28 Near the top right hand corner there appears to be an imprint as follows: 
     
      
       
       RECEIVED 
        
       - 9 JUN 2005 
        
       COURT HOUSE 
        
       SUTHERLAND 
       
      
    29 Inexplicably, the latter document was not on the court file when the three matters were before the magistrate. The prosecutor explained to him that the document had probably been handed back to the prosecution service by the court registry, and that it had been “found in the prosecutor’s papers” T 4.56. That was a copy, but he told the magistrate the original “does exist also”. 
     
      
    30 The proceedings were conducted somewhat informally. Neither document was formally tendered. Both counsel for Ms Stevens and the prosecutor appear to have proceeded on the assumption that the latter was authentic. However, although Mr Murray did not object to the magistrate’s seeing it, he objected to its going into the court file. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour knows my point is you can only adjudicate on what’s before you and my worry is … you were handed an extra document … with a court stamp on it. Now, … that had never been and has never been filed in the clerk of the court’s office or been part of your Honour’s file …”. 
          
        T 9.7 
        
       
      
    31 Later the prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Is your Honour satisfied that it is a stamp from this Court saying that it is received at Sutherland Court –“. 
         T 11.19 
        
       
      
    32 His Honour responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Prima facie, I can’t come to any other view”. 
          
        T 11.23 
        
       
      
    33 The prosecutor then explained: 
     
      
       
        
        “[I]t’s normal procedure for the Deputy Registrar to receive charges of this nature which are bordering on being statute barred and for him to stamp it and actually provide a copy to the prosecutor’s office … It’s not a normal procedure … that a hardcopy receipt is given back … but in this … instant … that may have been an explanation because it was bordering on being statute barred.” 
          
        T 11.32 
        
       
      
    34 Later Mr Murray, having again been asked to put his submission, said to the magistrate: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he thing is you haven’t got bench sheets … generated before it was statute barred.” 
          
        T 12.21 
        
       
      
    35 His Honour then gave judgment, saying, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the documents that I have identified earlier that are produced or sourced, from what I describe as police force or police service sources, they bear the Court registry stamp and on their face, at least, could indicate that the proceedings were commenced within time. For the purposes of determining these matters, however, counsel for the accused has asked the Court to determine this matter on the Court file and the Court record. Confining the determination to those source documents, the … computer system operating within the registry … would establish that there was an electronic transfer from the police force to the Court no early [sic] than 28 July 2005. How a hardcopy typed document is stamped and shown as being received on 29/06/05 [sic] is not readily explicable.  
        
       
       
        
        Based solely on the … documents that are available to the court for making … these determinations, whether one accepts the computer transferred data which on its face is 28 July 2005, or the other hard copy document, this Court could not come to the view that the relevant proceedings … were commenced within time.” 
         T 14-15 
        
       
      
    36 There was then an application made for costs. His Honour declined to make a costs order, among other reasons including this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Clearly it has to be accepted … that the … legal services division … have within their file … a document which on its face would indicate that not only was it a document generated within the parameters of the statutory period, but more importantly … bore an external endorsement source, and by that I mean a received stamp bearing a particular date, from the courthouse at Sutherland … One could with some degree of confidence rely on the … accuracy, not simply of the computer generated document, but the endorsement appearing on it so far as the validity or otherwise of that documentation is concerned … [T]he arguments advanced by the prosecuting authority so far as commencement of proceedings in time or otherwise were not without significant foundation.  
        
       
       
        
        Notwithstanding the Court has determined adverse [sic] to the prosecuting authority so far as its view on the documents within the court file, this court would not be of the view that there are … circumstances that would enliven the provisions …” 
          
        T 17-18 
        . 
        
       
      
    37 The plaintiff submitted there had been a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction. In Ex parte Hebburn Ltd; Re Kearsley Shire Council (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 416 at 420, Jordan CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he mere fact that a tribunal has made a mistake of law, even as to the proper construction of a statute, does not necessarily constitute a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction:  
        R v Minister of Health  
        [1939] 1 KB 232 at 245-6. But there are mistakes and mistakes; and if a mistake of law as to the proper construction of a statute investing a tribunal with jurisdiction leads it to misunderstand the nature of the jurisdiction which it is to exercise, and to apply  
        “a wrong and inadmissible test”:  
        Estate and Trust Agencies (1927) Ltd v Singapore Improvement Trust  
        [1937] AC 898 at 917; or to  
        “misconceive its duty,” 
         or  
        “not to apply itself to the question which the law prescibes” 
        :  
        The King v War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal  
        (1933) 50 CLR 228 at 242-3; 16 Austn Digest 808; or  
        “to misunderstand the nature of the opinion which it is to form” 
        : 
          
        The King v Connell  
        (1944) 69 CLR 407 at 432, in giving a decision in exercise of its jurisdiction or authority, a decision so given will be regarded as given in a purported and not a real exercise of jurisdiction, leaving the jurisdiction in law constructively unexercised, and the tribunal liable to the issue of a prerogative writ of mandamus to hear and determined the matter according to law:  
        R v Board of Education  
        [1910] 2 KB 165.” 
        
       
      
    38 The record of what occurred before the magistrate persuades me that when he decided the prosecutor had not proved the three CANs had been filed at the Sutherland Local Court within six months from the date of the relevant events, he asked himself this question: 
     
      
       
        
        “Does the court file contain a record of the filing of the CANs within the time prescribed by section 179  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
        ?” 
        
       
      
    39 Whereas, the question he should have asked was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Were the CANs filed within the time prescribed by section 179  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
        ?” 
        
       
      
    40 There is nothing in the legislative framework that required the magistrate to restrict his consideration to the documents physically on the court file when deciding whether the CANs had been filed in time. No doubt, in the ordinary course, a Local Court file will contain the CAN filed by the relevant police officer. But there will be occasions when, for administrative reasons, or through error, it will not. The prosecutor would (if able) be at liberty to call or tender such evidence at his or her disposal as is relevant to the issue of whether, and if so when, the CAN was filed. 
     
      
    41 The question as seen by his Honour was not so much how service is to be proved, but whether, according to the court file alone, service had been proved. His Honour did not say why he considered he was obliged only to have regard to the court file on the service issue, especially given he did not confine his consideration to file documents on the costs issue. He merely appears to have accepted counsel’s argument, which was based on the erroneous assumption that resort could only be had to the court file to determine whether or not the CANs had been filed. 
     
      
    42 As I conclude the magistrate did not consider the correct question, his Honour has not applied himself to the question prescribed for him by the law. This was, I consider, a constructive failure to exercise his jurisdiction. His duty to make a decision as to the validity of the proceedings remains, constructively, unperformed: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597 at 616; [53] (Gaudron and Gummow JJ). 
     
      
       
      Utility of Remitter 
       
      
    43 Before the magistrate, Mr Murray also argued the police officer who served the CANs had not complied with Rule 37(2)(e) by endorsing “the manner in which the person was informed of the address” to which he sent them. On the copies of the CANs before the magistrate the officer, in purported compliance with that rule, said “Residential address – source defendant.” That response was apparently one of only a limited number available to an officer putting entries into the COPS system. It seems clear enough that that part of the endorsement complies with Rule 37(2)(e), showing that the defendant gave police the address used for service. The rule does not require the service address itself to be endorsed: Director of Public Prosecutions v Cakici at [29]. The magistrate, given the view he took on jurisdiction, did not decide this issue. I see no reason why, were the matter remitted, the prosecution could not call evidence on the issue as occurred for example on the service issue in Sharman v DPP. 
     
      
    44 Since the facts giving rise to these matters occurred, section 177(4) Criminal Procedure Act has been amended. It is no longer necessary for a CAN to be filed within seven days of service with an endorsement of service. As explained in the second reading speech on 27 October 2006 in the Legislative Assembly by the Parliamentary Secretary on behalf of the Attorney-General (Hansard, p 3665): 
     
      
       
        
        “The amendments seek to remove the nexus between the service and the jurisdiction of the court.” 
        
       
      
    45 The amendment is one I take into account but does not militate against the orders sought here. Though there has been delay, it is not lengthy and is to my satisfaction explained: the police needed time to consider their position and seek advice. I would not decline the orders on discretionary grounds. The injuries of the victims of the accident were significant and the offences if proved, likewise. Further, Ms Stevens has not appeared to argue against the relief sought. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    46 I propose to make an order in the nature of mandamus pursuant to section 69 Supreme Court Act, and the second declaration sought. I do not consider the first one sought is necessary. The plaintiff has asked for an order for costs against Ms Stevens. Ms Stevens’ submitting appearance excluded issues of costs. I will hear the parties on costs. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
       
        
        1. I declare that the Second Defendant fell into jurisdictional error in determining that he was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        2. I order that the proceedings be remitted to the Local Court to be determined according to law.

     JUDGMENT1. Two young men were charged with not wearing seat belts. As it happened the police issued the Court Attendance Notices to the wrong persons. Hence the young men both had good defences. They went to the Local Court and defended the prosecution. In each case they were both acquitted. They both sought costs against the prosecutor and the Magistrate refused in each case to make an order for costs.2. Both men appeal to this court under s 11 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Their appeals both raise the same point. Their appeals are against the refusal of the learned Magistrate to award them costs. 3. Mr Weller who appears for both appellants in this court argues that they have a right of appeal against the Magistrate’s order to refuse costs. He says that right arises from the fact that they are appeals under s 11(1) against a “sentence” by a Local Court. He refers to the extended definition of “sentence” contained in s 3 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. In that extended definition clause (e) provides that “sentence” means as follows:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          (e) any order for costs made by a Local Court against a person in connection with summary proceedings taken against the person. 
          ” 
           
          
         
        
       
      In a nutshell Mr Weller’s argument is that the learned Magistrate’s refusal to make an order for costs amounted to an order for costs.  
       
       
      4. Mr Musico, who appears for the prosecutor and respondent to these appeals, argues that a refusal to make an order for costs does not fall within clause (e) of the definition of “sentence”. There is, he said, no other provision which entitles the appellants to appeal to this court and therefore the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
       provides them with no right of appeal.  
       
       
      5. Hence the question for my determination is whether a refusal by a Magistrate to make an order for costs sought by a successful defendant amounts to an “ 
      order for costs made by a Local Court against a person 
      ” in accordance with clause (e) of the definition of “sentence” in the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
      .  
       
       
      6. For the following reasons, in my opinion the language of the section does not include a refusal by the Magistrate to make an order for costs. The first reason is that I reject Mr Weller’s argument that  
      Palmer v Haddad 
        
      [2000] NSWSC 545 is applicable to this case. It is a sound argument and the case does point towards a favourable result for Mr Weller but, in my opinion, the case is distinguishable. It was a judgment of Simpson J in a case where her Honour was hearing an appeal from a refusal of a Magistrate to order costs in favour of a successful plaintiff in a claim under the  
      De Facto Relationships Act 1984 
      . One of the bases for the appeal was an asserted remedy under the  
      Justices Act 1902 
      , specifically s104(2)(c). That provided for appeals by informants and an informant was entitled to appeal against “ 
      orders for costs made by Magistrates in summary proceedings 
      ”.  
       
       
      7. Her Honour said at [11] that she favoured an interpretation of that clause which meant that “ 
      orders for costs 
      ” should encompass “ 
      an order in relation to costs 
      ”. That would include, her Honour said, an order refusing an application for costs.  
       
       
      8. The first reason given by her Honour is not applicable to this case. The proceedings were in the nature of civil proceedings whereas the  
      Justice’s Act 
        
      was focused on criminal proceedings. As her Honour said, amendments to the  
      Justice’s Act 
       over the years have not accommodated the expanding civil jurisdiction of the Local Court despite civil proceedings coming within its ambit. Her Honour was therefore construing a criminal statute with that in mind.  
       
       
      9. The second reason and more fundamental one given by her Honour was that a narrow interpretation would have the result of  
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          attributing to the legislature an intention to create unbalanced rights for no apparent principled reason. An informant against whom an order for costs is made would have a right of appeal, but an informant who unsuccessfully sought a costs order would not. Such a capricious intention should not be attributed to the legislature unless the clear words of the legislation so demand. In my view they do not. 
          ” 
           
          
         
        
       
      10. For reasons which I will develop, in my opinion the clear words of the legislation in this case demand a result which is unfavourable to Mr Weller.  
       
       
      11.  
      Palmer v Haddad 
       was referred to by Grove J in  
      Murdoch v Petterson 
        
      [2005] NSW SC 1359. In that case a successful prosecutor appealed against a refusal by a Magistrate to order costs in its favour or his or her favour. The appeal was brought under the legislation which is the subject of consideration in this case. Section 56(1) of the legislation relevantly provided at the time that the prosecutor  
       
        
         
          
           
            
            “ 
            may appeal to the Supreme Court against:  
             
            
           
          (a) a sentence imposed in any summary proceedings, or  
           
           
            
            (e) an order for costs made by a Local Court against the prosecutor in any summary proceedings. 
            ” 
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      As his Honour said, the issue must be determined in the context of the relevant legislation. His Honour referred to the extended definition of “sentence” which is also relevant to this case. His Honour referred to specifically to the same clause, namely (e) in the definition of “sentence”, which is the subject of this case. His Honour said at [11]: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          The express element of definition in sub-paragraph (e) refers to an order against a person and the refusal to order that person to pay costs is not accommodated within the notion of costs against him or her. 
          ” 
           
          
         
        
       
      12. I respectfully agree with his Honour and for the same reasons do not regard the refusal to make a costs order in this case as amounting to an order for costs against a person. As his Honour went on to say, in its natural and ordinary meaning order does not encompass a refusal to make an order: see [12]. 
       
       
      13. His Honour acknowledged Simpson J’s judgment in  
      Palmer v Haddad 
       but distinguished that case for the reason that the statutory context of any such decision is of considerable significance. One reason supporting his Honour’s opinion was that he did not regard a definition of sentence which accommodated or allowed an appeal by a prosecutor as being  
       
        
         
        “ 
        compatible with a concept that a sentence involves an imposition on a defendant. and it would, in my view, require a clear statement for the expression ‘a sentence imposed’ within a statute to include a meaning of denial of an order for costs in favour of a prosecutor. 
        ” 
         
        
       
      
      That is a factor which is not relevant in the present case. 
      
      14. Which brings me to the third reason for my judgment or rather for my reasons for dismissing the appeal which is the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
      Director of Public Prosecutions v Roslyndale Shipping Pty Limited 
       which is reported in (2003) 59 NSWLR 210. Spigelman CJ delivered a judgment in which Studdart J specifically agreed. The case concerned the issue whether a refusal to make a costs order could be the basis of an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. In order for it to be accommodated a refusal to make a costs order had to be included in the definition of “ 
      sentence 
      ” in the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
      , which in s 2 defines sentence to include  
       
        
       “ 
       (h) any order for payment of costs made by the court of trial in respect of a person. 
       ” 
        
       
      15. The Chief Justice distinguished Simpson J’s judgment in  
      Palmer v Haddad 
       because of the significance of the word “ 
      payment 
      ” included in the definition of sentence in the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
      . The Chief Justice also acknowledged that in its natural and ordinary meaning the word “ 
      order 
      ” would not encompass a refusal to make an order. But his Honour acknowledged that that natural and ordinary meaning could be displaced by the context after a careful examination of the statutory context relevant in that case. His Honour concluded that the natural and ordinary meaning of the word “ 
      order 
      ” should be applied. In doing so his Honour made reference to a statutory provision relevant in the discussion in that case which was s 5AA(1) of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       which provided that person (a) convicted of an offence; or (b) against whom an order to pay any costs is made, may appeal. 
       
       
      16. For reasons which are not directly relevant to this appeal his Honour took into account the language of s 5AA in construing s 2(h) of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
      . His Honour said the reference to “ 
      payment of costs 
      ” in s 2(h) is reinforced by the terminology in s 5AA “ 
      against whom an order to pay any costs is made 
      ”. The Chief Justice said that a  
       
        
         
         “ 
         failure to make an order does not fall naturally within the word ‘payment’ nor within the idea of an order being ‘made’ ‘against’ a person 
         .” 
          
         
        
       
      17. I too am of the same view so far as the definition of “ 
      sentence 
      ” contained in s3 of  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
       is concerned, so far as that definition provides that it may include “ 
      any order for costs made by a Local Court against a person 
      ”. The failure to make an order does not fall naturally within the idea of an order being “made” “against” a person. I acknowledge Mr Weller’s argument that as Simpson J said the result may mean that a person has a right to appeal against an order for costs against them, but not a refusal. But in my opinion the clear language of the statute does not allow me any other interpretation.  
       
       
      18. Accordingly, I determine this appeal against sentence by dismissing the appeal in accordance with s 20(2)(c) of the  
      Crimes Appeal and Review Act 2001 
      . 
       
       
      MUSICO: Your Honour the prosecutor applies for a costs order under s 28(3). 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Of the same Act? 
       
       
      MUSICO: Of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Just let me have a look, 28? 
       
       
      MUSICO: Subs 3 your Honour, the miscellaneous powers provision of the Act concerning this court’s powers.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Right subject to s 70. 
       
       
      MUSICO: s 70 is the equivalent of s 214 your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Costs against the prosecutor. All right, so you’re wanting costs. 
       
       
      MUSICO: If your Honour’s agreeable I would ask your Honour to quantify costs at approximately $1600 which would provide sufficient indemnity for my seven hours attendance at court today, travelling to and from the city. A $200 agent fee for the last occasion this matter was before the court and it was adjourned and say an hour of my attendances in reading the file and advising my client. Furthermore if your Honour agrees with that submission then under s 72 of the Act which determines where costs or discusses a frame with the order, I would submit that under s 72 your Honour order that each appellant pay $800 costs to the Windsor Local Court within say twenty-eight days. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: What do you say Mr Weller? 
       
       
      WELLER: Well your Honour I’m instructed to oppose an application for costs. I don’t dispute that my friend is entitled to make the application but we oppose it and on discretionary grounds and ask your Honour not to impose an order for costs against the appellants. Having regard to the circumstances of how this appeal came about, that is I mentioned it to your Honour in my original address that prima facie these appellants were entitled to an order for costs. The fact that the appeal has been brought in the wrong place, I would submit your Honour, is not a matter that should be placed as a burden upon these appellants.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Who had an arguable case. 
       
       
      WELLER: Yes we did have an arguable case and your Honour I think mentioned that at least once, if not twice in your Honour’s judgment.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: The normal thing if I dismiss an appeal, conviction or sentence appeal by an offender I don’t make an order for costs do I? 
       
       
      WELLER: In thirty years your Honour I’ve never seen one. It’s different if there’s a private, it can be different if there’s a private prosecution involving private parties, but I’ve never seen one. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: So these appeals are normally run by a solicitor employed by the DPP office aren’t they and Mr Musico is here from the Crown Solicitor’s Office I assume. 
       
       
      MUSICO: That’s correct your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Mr Musico why, I mean normally I wouldn’t order costs against an unsuccessful appellant in a conviction or sentence appeal particularly, I say, in this case where there was a pretty good argument and we’ve had to delve into the authorities. Why should I in this case, particularly given the history where it sounds as though the police messed it up in the first place. They took the point, they won, they asked for costs. 
       
       
      MUSICO: Without a transcript your Honour I can’t comment on the correctness of the Windsor Local Court Magistrate’s decision. But your Honour as that earlier case I cited,  
      Farley and Sterling 
       states there was an avenue of redress against the Magistrate’s decision, it wasn’t to this court it was an application to the Supreme Court for prerogative relief under s 69 of the  
      Supreme Court Act 
       and your Honour it was clearly parliament’s intention that costs can be awarded in Local Court appeals to the District Court, I’ve referred your Honour to s 28(3) the preceding section states “ 
      that in determining an appeal the District Court may exercise any function that the original Local Court could have exercised 
      .” Costs, there’s two provisions. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: You’re right, I can see the power there.  
       
       
      MUSICO: And s 70 your Honour deals with a successful accused’s right to costs. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes, yes. 
       
       
      MUSICO: So there’s plenty of costs provisions on both sides of the fence in this Act and I’d submit, using the words of s 28(3)it would be just for your Honour to award costs because this case could have been commenced in the Supreme Court. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: All right.  
       
      19. Mr Musico for his client has sought costs I refuse that application. I acknowledge my power to award it in circumstances that I think are just in accordance with s 28(3) of the  
      Crimes Appeal and Review Act 2001 
      . Two factors influence me here. The first is that the appellants were originally successful in the Local Court as a result of, apparently, some mix up, perhaps incompetence, I cannot say, in the issuing of the process. The second factor is that although they have an avenue of address elsewhere in the Supreme Court, as pointed out by Mr Musico, they had an arguable case in this court which required my attention for an hour or so in court with counsel and then additional time in chambers considering two Supreme Court and one Court of Criminal Appeal authority before I reached a conclusion. Accordingly I refuse the application for costs.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: The offender Michael John Shumack appears for sentence after trial where he was found guilty by jury of two counts; the first count is that of dangerous driving occasioning death, which is an offence pursuant to s 52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act. That offence carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. The second count is of fail to stop and assist after vehicle impact causing death, which is an offence pursuant to s 52AB(1) of the Crimes Act. That offence carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. The trial commenced in the Wollongong District Court on 2 October 2007 and the jury returned their verdicts of guilty on 15 October 2007FACTS2 The offender left his work address at Unanderra at 2.20pm on Friday 15 September 2006 in the company of a work colleague, Andrew Robertson. They travelled in the offender’s silver Ford XR8, registration number SHU-11S to the Dapto Leagues Club. CCTV showed Robertson purchasing schooners for himself and the offender at 2.42pm. 3 The offender’s brother, David Shumack, Steven Dykes and Richard Stubbs, later joined them. At 3.10pm, the offender purchased five schooners. Richard Stubbs gave evidence that he purchased a schooner for the offender and following a win on the pokies, Andrew Robertson said he shouted everyone twice. Robertson confirmed that during the course of the afternoon he bought three schooners for the offender.4 The offender and Robertson were observed to leave the club shortly before 5pm. Upon that evidence I have no difficulty being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had consumed at least those five schooners during this period at the club.5 The offender then drove Robertson to Woolworths to buy groceries and alcohol. They dropped in briefly to Robertson’s home before driving to the IGA supermarket and returned to Robertson’s home at around 6pm.6 The offender then drove to the home of his former de facto, Ms Tina Sweeney at 10 Silverwood Place, Horsley. At that location the offender had two bottles of Tooheys Extra Dry and a sip of Tequila and margarita mix. The evidence established that the offender left the residence at about 7.35pm or shortly thereafter. The evidence of Lisa Rogers and Jason Rogers satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt of that fact.7 At about 7.43pm the victim, Ashleigh Harriss, had been walking along Horsley Drive, a short distance behind her two friends, Jessica Brown and Albinas Lenartas. As Ms Brown and Mr Lenartas stepped off the kerb to cross the road Ms Brown said she noticed a car at the roundabout coming towards them. She yelled out to her friends to hurry up and she commented, 
     
      
      “I thought we were going to get hit and that we were in danger”.  
      
    8 She said her impression was that the car was driving at high speed and it appeared to be almost going down the centre of the road. She said it only took the car seconds to get from the roundabout to where they were. She said as she saw the car approach closer she began to run a bit faster. She said she was just over half way across the road when she heard a loud noise and the shattering of glass. 9 Mrs Dandridge and her daughter, Kristy Lee Dandridge, gave evidence that they were sitting in their car parked across the road from number 31 Horsley Drive. Mrs Dandridge observed the first two young persons crossing the road and noticed a car coming down from the roundabout moving very fast. She saw the victim walk out and the car hit her. She heard two different sounds and the breaking of glass. She said the victim went up in the air and her hands went up and she went straight back.10 She said she was expecting the driver of that vehicle to pull over. At a point approximately three to four houses down the road she noticed the vehicle’s brake lights go on for a few seconds and then the car sped off. Kristy Lee Dandridge made similar observations and immediately went to the victim’s assistance. She then went to a nearby residence to get help.DECEASED’S INJURIES11 Dr McBride gave evidence of a deep impact injury to the left thigh of Ashleigh Harriss causing the fracture of her pelvis in several places. The Doctor also said she had received fatal head injuries. Upon a review of the injuries Dr McBride stated that: 
     
      
      “The most likely scenario is the deceased moving at the time of impact, was impacted from the left side and probably had her left leg in front as she was walking, so the bumper bar has actually impacted with the middle of the right leg.” 
      
    12 He further commented that: 
     
      
      “She has stepped out so the vehicle is on the right. It came to her attention and she took evasive action as quick as the could, which would be to return to the kerb and she pivoted around and got struck, and we’re dealing with something that’s happened in less than half a second.” 
      
    13 Dr McBride gave evidence that the car had hit Ms Harriss “fairly close to square on”, and he could see no abrasions on the left thigh to indicate it was a swipe style contact. 14 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence of the doctor that Ms Harriss had made her way onto the roadway from the kerb crossing in the same manner as her two friends when she attempted to turn and retreat in the direction of the kerb, and in that manoeuvre she was struck by the car.OTHER FINDINGS OF FACT15 Horsley Drive ran through a residential area and had a speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour. Police observed no skid or tyre marks on the surface of the road in the vicinity of the collision. Later inspection of the offender’s vehicle showed damage consistent with having struck the victim on the front nearside. 16 On the basis of the evidence earlier referred to of the offender having had five schooners of beer at the club and two stubbies of Tooheys Extra Dry (evenly spaced) at the home of Ms Sweeney, Dr Judith Perl gave evidence that she would have expected the minimum blood alcohol reading at the time of the collision to be 0.1 grams per 100 millilitres. She stated: 
     
      
      “The effects of alcohol in fact start at the cortex, so at the very low blood alcohol levels it’s the cortical area that is more effected, and as the blood alcohol level goes up the other parts of the brain become progressively more and more effected. So at very low levels you would expect things like your perceptions, judgment, decision making factors to be impaired. As the blood alcohol level increased above .08 you start to see things like slowing and slurring of speech, unsteadiness or swaying, poor coordination… so actual impairment starts at levels as low as .03 and by the time you get to .08 you can usually see signs of intoxication, but you’ve already got impairment present of the higher levels of functioning.” 
      
    17 Dr Perl reported that the impairment of one’s peripheral vision and measurable effects can be detected at .03.18 I am satisfied on the evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the impact. It also established that he was driving in a manner dangerous as a result of a combination of factors: 
     
      
      1. He was driving under the influence of alcohol so that he lacked the full capacity to control and manage his motor vehicle; 
      
     
     
      
      2. That he drove at an excessive speed along the street given the 50 kilometre speed limit; 
      
     
     
      
      3. That he failed to keep a proper lookout, not slowing for Ms Brown and Mr Lenartas as they had to hurry on out of his path before the car struck Ashleigh Harriss. 
      
    19 During the police investigation the offender attempted to set up a false alibi and concocted a story about two strangers knocking on his door, inquiring about his car being for sale and taking it for a test drive; the suggestion being that it was the two persons who were in fact in his vehicle, one of them driving, at the time of the collision; that having knocked down and killed Ms Harriss they simply drove his car back into his carport, said that they liked the car and one was going to speak to his father the following day about the purchase. They walked off into the darkness and he never saw them again.20 In my view, and no doubt that of the jury, the evidence was overwhelming in respect of the offender being the driver. In view of the fact that the offender continues to exhibit a lack of remorse I should refer to the evidence on this very issue.21 The offender’s false alibi involved him having left the home of Tina Sweeney at around 7pm, returning to his own home and then allowing two strangers to test drive his car at some time after 7.30pm. Lisa Rogers, who lived across the road from Tina Sweeney, left her home at around about 7.50 to 7.55pm to drive to work. That time could be pinpointed as when she drove past the collision scene, an ambulance had arrived (19:52:15) but the police had not (19:58). Jason Rogers gave evidence that he was familiar with the exhaust system on the offender’s car, and that he had heard it drive off from Silverwood Place at about a quarter to 8 or ten to 8, that was his estimation of the time. He said he was not looking at the clock, but he recalled hearing the offender’s car when Lisa had just come out of the bathroom dressed for work.22 On this evening, Friday 15 September 2006, St George played Manly in Sydney in a finals match in the NRL competition. Indeed, the offender’s grandfather with whom he lived had travelled to Sydney to attend the game. The timing of the live television coverage of this game became especially significant in respect of certain observations made by a number of witnesses. (The live coverage started at 7.30pm - at 7.54pm the game started - at 9.39pm the game finished).23 The defence called in its case Mr George Talevski. He lived at 13 Silverwood Place and he said he was late in closing his business on Friday 15 September. When returning to his home he showered and changed, as he had arranged to attend the home of a friend (about 800 metres away) to watch the live coverage of the football. As he walked out to his driveway he said he saw the offender’s vehicle reversed in Mrs Sweeney’s driveway. He said the car was idling, the driver’s door open and the light on. He thought it would have been around 7 o’clock. He said that when he arrived at his friend’s place the game had not started. He said, 
     
      
      “There were bits and pieces on TV but I wasn’t taking a whole heap of notice of it at the time”. 
      
    24 He was then asked: 
     
      
      “Q. How long did you get there before the game actually started? 
      
     
     
      
      A. Probably if I had to estimate it it would have been 15 or 20 minutes.” 
      
    25 With the evidence of the game commenced at 7.54pm, that would have placed the offender’s car in Ms Sweeney’s driveway at about 7.35pm. This of course is consistent with the combined evidence of Lisa Rogers and Jason Rogers.26 The offender told police that after the return of his car by the two strangers he did not notice any damage to it. Ms Coad and her mother, Ms Hill, said that the offender arrived at their home during the second half of the televised rugby league game. Ms Coad thought this was about 9.10 to 9.15pm, and Ms Hill said that there was about 20 minutes of the football game to go when he arrived.27 The offender further informed police that it was not until after the football, after he was leaving Ms Coad’s home, that he became aware for the first time of the damage to his nearside rear vision mirror, which was hanging from the side of the car. He said he inspected the car further under a streetlight outside of his home and noticed further damage to the front nearside.28 Mr Alan Smith who lived next door to the offender gave evidence that he returned to his home that evening at about 9.10pm. He said it was at this time that he saw the offender standing between the passenger door and the front tyre with his hands up around where the windscreen wipers were. Mr Smith went inside, got changed and had some dinner. He said his girlfriend, Lisa Feberwee, was watching the football. He did not watch the football but began watching a movie at around 9.40pm. Mr Smith was an impressive witness. I was satisfied on his evidence that the offender was indeed inspecting the damage of his car prior to driving to Tracey Coad’s home.29 Upon this evidence the jury would have had little difficulty in being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the Crown had proved its case that the offender was indeed the driver.MORAL CULPABILITY30 Concerning the correct approach to making an assessment of the offender’s moral culpability I have had regard to the case of R v Errington (2005) 147 ACR 553 where Mason P said at paras 26-27: 
     
      
      “The central inquiry with regard to the objective seriousness of the particular offences is identification of the degree of moral culpability involved, this being ‘a critical component of the objective circumstances of the offence’.” (referenced to the case of  
      Whyte 
       at 284) 
      
    31 His Honour then went on to say: 
     
      
      “The jurisprudence in this field recognises ‘abandonment of responsibility’ as one method of describing a high degree of moral culpability. This does not however endorse a bright line subcategory. There is a wide spectrum of behaviour indicative of differing levels of moral culpability, indeed differing degrees of abandonment. It is not required that cases be assigned to one or other of two pigeon holes marked respectively ‘momentary intention or mis-judgment’, and ‘abandoned responsibility’.” 
      
    32 In R v Khatter [2000] NSW CCA 32 Simpson J held at para 31: 
     
      
      “Offences under s 52A are not divided into those of momentary inattention and those of abandonment of responsibility. Those are the two extremes. There are shades and gradations of moral culpability in different instances of the offences and it is proper for the courts to recognise a continuum rather than a dichotomy when assessing moral culpability.” 
      
    I am in agreement with those remarks of Simpson J, in particular, that “there are shades and gradations of moral culpability in different instances of the offences.”33 There are a number of aggravating factors referred to in the guideline judgment of R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 that relate to moral culpability. In the present case I have found that the offender was driving under the influence, that speed was a factor, that Ms Harriss, Ms Brown and Mr Lenartas were all at risk and that the offender failed to stop.34 In Whyte, Spigelman CJ in referring to the above factors said at para 228: 
     
      
      “In the above list of aggravating factors, items III to XII are frequently recurring elements which directly impinge on the moral culpability of the offender at the time of the offence. Individually, but more often in some combination, they may indicate that the moral culpability is high. One way of expressing such a conclusion is to ask whether the combination of circumstances are such that it can be said that the offender had abandoned responsibility for his own or her own conduct. That is not the only way of expressing such a conclusion.” 
      
    35 Of course the list of aggravating factors referred to as indicative of typical offences was not meant to operate as a checklist but as a guide as commented in Errington; they remain illustrative, not definitive.36 Mr Doris, counsel for the offender, submitted a number of matters that should be taken into account on the question of moral culpability and abandonment of responsibility including that the street was dark and not well lit, that it was quiet residential area and the limited opportunity the offender had to see the victim before the collision owing to her being dressed in black. Those matters I have taken into consideration.37 When scrutinising the present facts, with particular reference to the abovementioned aggravating factors, my assessment is that the offender had abandoned responsibility for his conduct so that his moral culpability was high.SECOND COUNT38 This offence was introduced by virtue of the Crimes Amendment (Road Accidents) Bill. In the second reading speech in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 21 September 2005 it was stated: 
     
      
      “Under this bill, a new offence of failing to stop, with much heavier penalties, is introduced into the Crimes Act in recognition of society’s abhorrence of those who injure their fellow citizens and then abandon them to die. When a driver leaves the scene of an accident, leaving in his or her wake a dead or badly injured person without attempting to render assistance, the fundamental code of a civilised society is breached. Every driver on our roads needs to be aware that with the privilege of driving on our roads comes a fundamental responsibility to our fellow drivers... the focus of the new offences is to ensure assistance for victims of serious vehicle impacts. Assistance may save a life, minimise injury, improve the prospect of recovery, alleviate suffering, and preserve the dignity of the injured or deceased. Failure to stop and assist in serious accidents should invite significant punishment. The requirement is to stop and give any assistance necessary that is in the driver’s power to give... What is required is for the person to stop and take steps to assist directly or obtain expert help by contacting police or emergency services to ensure that expert assistance is obtained at the earlier opportunity.” 
      
    39 The jury’s verdict meant that despite the offender being aware his car had impacted on its front nearside with Ms Harriss, sending her up onto and along the bonnet, aerial and left front windscreen pillar, and causing him to slow his vehicle, he nevertheless made a conscious decision not to stop and render assistance.40 In respect of both counts on the indictment, deterrence, both specific and general, are significant factors on sentence.VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS41 I have received and considered victim impact statements of the mother of Ashleigh Harriss, Ms Sue Potts, her grandmother, Ms Phyllis Aspevik, and Mr Robbie Lawson. It is obvious that your loss has been a devastating one, the effects of which will be felt by family and friends for a long time to come. Whilst I do understand and appreciate your grief, the court process is not always capable of doing much to alleviate your sense of loss. Having considered all of what has been placed before me, in accordance with R v Previtera (1997) 94 ACR 75 and also R v Bollen (1998) 99 ACR 510, I have not had regard to those particular effects in assessing the quantum of sentence.SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES42 I now turn to the subjective matters in respect of the offender. He was thirty-three at the time of the offence and is now thirty-five years. He has no prior criminal record and what can only be described as a relatively minor traffic record. His parents live in Dapto and he has a younger brother and sister. Two reference/testimonials (exhibit 1) were tendered on his behalf. The first is under the hand of Mark Robertson. He has known the offender for seventeen years. He has worked, socialised and played sport with him. He stated that the offender was a quiet, shy, family orientated man with a special love and admiration of cars. He said he was a hard worker and had always been a safe, responsible driver. He confirmed that when the offender’s grandmother passed away in late 2005 the offender moved into his grandfather’s house in Parkdale Avenue to look after him. Mr Robertson stated that he will continue to provide support to the offender during his incarceration.43 The second letter is under the hand of Mr Terry Askew, Managing Director of M & E Engineering Proprietary Limited. He indicated that the offender had been employed in that company since May 2005 and has an exemplary work history. He described him as conscientious, pleasant, reliable and a valued team member. Mr Askew stated that his company would offer the offender employment when the matter was ultimately resolved.44 When giving evidence at trial Ms Tina Sweeney stated that she had been in a relationship with the offender for about thirteen years. They have two children from that relationship, now thirteen years and ten years. They separated in 2003. Ms Sweeney has custody of the children. She said the offender has them every second weekend. However, quite apart from that arrangement, she said he could come and see the children as often as he liked, and this would usually occur at least once a week.45 I have taken into account the following mitigating factors under s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: 
     
      
      (e) the offender has no prior criminal record 
       
      (f) he was a person of good character 
       
      (g) he is unlikely to re-offend 
       
      (h) he has good prospects of rehabilitation - this must be so given his prior good character, his previous work record and the continued support of his family. 
      
    46 I have taken into account the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I have also had regard to s 5 of that Act. Having considered all possible alternatives, I am satisfied that given the objective seriousness of the offence no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.47 I find special circumstances being that at age 35 this will be his first time serving a custodial sentence and my assessment of his good prospects for rehabilitation. I regard this as sufficient reason to vary the statutory ratio.48 In my view there needs to be some accumulation of the sentences. I have borne in mind the principle of totality in respect of the sentences I am about to impose.49 You are convicted of both counts. 50 In respect of the first on the indictment I sentence you to a non-parole period of four years to date from 15 October 2007 and to expire on 14 October 2011. I sentence you to an additional term of two years to expire on 14 October 2013.51 In respect of the second count on the indictment I sentence you to a non-parole period of three years to date from 15 October 2009 and to expire on 14 October 2012. I sentence you to an additional term of two years to expire on 14 October 2014. 52 You will therefore become eligible for release to parole on 14 October 2012.53 Mr Shumack, finally I will just say this to you. Your parents and family do not deserve the torment and heartache that would be a necessary consequence of your continuing with the charade that you were not the driver, and therefore suggesting that you are the victim of some terrible injustice. If they have listened to the facts recited here today in court, hopefully they will be able to accept where the real truth lies, if they had not already done so. I have no doubt they will continue to support you, and that is to their credit. But they should not be put through the false pain of thinking that some injustice has occurred, and only you can put an end to that.54 I impose the automatic disqualification period of 3 years to date from 28 September 2006.55 I also order that the two matters on the section 166 certificate be withdrawn and dismissed. Thankyou.

     Headnote 
     
     
      
    The appellant was tried and convicted on a joint indictment with John Hohaia for murder and the offence of robbery in company. The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 21 years with a non-parole period of 15 years 9 months in respect of the murder. John Hohaia was sentenced in respect of the murder to a term of 21 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 years. On the count of robbery in company, each was sentenced to a fixed term of 18 months imprisonment to be served concurrently.  
     
      
    At trial the appellant relied upon an alibi defence that at the time of the murder he was at his place of employment. The appellant called Robert Dibb in support of his alibi. Mr Dibb stated that he spoke to the appellant on the night of the murder and that the appellant told him that he was on his way to work. It was the Crown’s case, in respect of this evidence, that Robert Dibb was either mistaken about the date that he saw the appellant, or that he may have been fabricating the evidence. In response, counsel for the appellant at trial sought to tender a previous consistent statement made by Robert Dibb to a solicitor. The written statement was made eight months after the night in question. Counsel relied upon s 108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (the Evidence Act) which, relevantly, provides that the “credibility rule” does not apply if it is suggested that evidence given by a witness has been fabricated, re-constructed or is the result of suggestion. Robert Dibb’s prior consistent statement was rejected by the trial judge.  
     
      
    The appellant appeals against his conviction on the ground that the trial judge erred in refusing leave to adduce Robert Dibb’s prior consistent statement and further, that the trial judge erred in the application of ss 108(3)(b) and 192 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the basis that his sentence lacks parity with the sentence imposed on John Hohaia, and further, that a different, less severe, sentence was warranted in law and ought to have been imposed. In particular, the appellant submitted that the trial judge failed to take into account his period of pre-sentence custody.Held per Beazley JA (Hulme and Latham JJ agreeing): 
     
      
       
      Did the trial judge err in refusing the tender of the prior consistent statement? 
      
       
      
      (1) The exercise of the discretion under s 108 of the  
      Evidence Act  
      depends upon the effect of the evidence on the witness’ credibility: [42]

        [1998] HCA 61; (1998) 195 CLR 606 (followed);

         [2000] NSWCCA 177;

      (2) There was nothing in Robert Dibb’s prior consistent statement that explained how it was that he remembered the date on which he said he saw the appellant. The trial judge’s assessment was correct that the jury would not have received any assistance from the statement in determining whether Robert Dibb had arrived at the date by a process of reconstruction or suggestion: [50] 
       
       
      (3) The trial judge was alive to the likelihood of the Crown’s general challenge to the truthfulness of Robert Dibb. While his Honour confined his remarks to the reliability of the evidence, he did not err by not addressing the question whether the evidence was fabricated. Even if his Honour should have addressed that question, the answer would have been the same: [63] 
       
       
      Did the appellant’s sentence lack parity with his co-offender? 
       
      (4) The appellant does not have a basis to feel aggrieved at the sentence imposed. His role was less than that of John Hohaia which was reflected in his lesser sentence. In addition, John Hohaia was younger and of limited intellect, which were factors his Honour was entitled to take into account: [79] 
       
        
      Roberts v R  
      [2007] NSWCCA 112 (referred to)  
       
       
      Did the trial judge fail to give proper effect to pre-sentence custody? 
       
      (5) It is desirable sentencing practice that, where there has been a period of pre-sentence custody exclusively referable to the offences for which sentence is being passed, the commencement of the sentence and the non-parole period should be back-dated for an equivalent period. In this case, the appellant was already serving a period of imprisonment, so that the five months pre-sentence custody to which his Honour referred, included the appellant being in custody for other offences: [87]-[88], [92]

         (1985) 1 NSWLR 588 (considered) 
        
       
       
      (6)  
      Having regard to the terms upon which his Honour imposed sentence and the fact he specifically stated the appellant was entitled to have credit for time served in custody, his Honour took the appellant’s pre-sentence custody into account. In any event, it was not demonstrated that some other sentence in law was warranted: [93]

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: On 21 March 2006, the appellant was found guilty of the murder of Alexander Szirt contrary to s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Crimes Act) and the offence of robbery in company contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    2 The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is imprisonment for life: s 19A of the Crimes Act. Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) prescribed a Standard Non-Parole Period of 20 years. The offence of robbery in company carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 21 years with a non-parole period of 15 years 9 months. On the count of robbery in company, the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of 18 months to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    3 The appellant appeals against his conviction on the ground that the trial judge, Kirby J, erred in law in refusing leave to adduce the evidence of a prior consistent statement made by Robert Dibb, who gave evidence to support the appellant’s alibi at trial that he was at work at the time of the murder: ground 1(a); and, further, that the trial judge erred in law in the application of ss 108(3)(b) and 192 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (the Evidence Act): ground 1(b).  
     
      
    4 The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the basis that his sentence lacks parity with the sentence imposed on the appellant’s co-offender, John Hohaia, and further, that a different, less severe, sentence was warranted in law and ought to have been imposed. 
     
      
    5 The appellant had been tried on a joint indictment with John Hohaia for the murder of Alexander Szirt (the deceased) during the early hours of 3 December 2003, and of the robbery in company of the deceased’s mobile phone and wallet. At trial, the appellant relied upon an alibi defence that at the time when the murder took place, he was at his place of employment, “Moussa’s Bakery and Pizzas” at Lakemba.  
     
      
    6 The appellant called Robert Dibb in support of his alibi evidence. He said that he saw the appellant shortly after midnight and spoke to him briefly. Robert Dibb’s evidence was that the appellant told him that he was on his way to work at a bakery. At the conclusion of Robert Dibb’s cross-examination, counsel appearing for the appellant at trial sought to adduce evidence of a statement that Robert Dibb had made to a solicitor on 29 July 2004, which was consistent with his evidence at trial. The tender of the statement was rejected: Regina v Abdulkader & Hohaia [No 1] [2006] NSWSC 198. 
     
      
       
      Outline of prosecution case 
       
      
    7 It was the Crown case that Alexander Szirt died between 3.15am and 5.15am on 3 December 2003, after a prolonged period of assault by the appellant and John Hohaia. The assault commenced at 52 Lucerne Street, Belmore, sometime after 10.30pm and continued until about 3am. Late in the afternoon of 3 December, the deceased was found in a car which was in a carpark in Wiley Park. Vinita Ram, the appellant’s then girlfriend, said the appellant drove her to the carpark at Wiley Park at about 5.15am and that the deceased was slumped in his car and was dead. 
     
      
    8 A post-mortem examination revealed that the deceased had died of asphyxia as a result of the inhalation of blood and the obstruction of airways. The examination also revealed various injuries which were consistent with the deceased having been assaulted by punching and/or kicking.  
     
      
    9 On the evening of 2 December 2003, the deceased, who lived at home with his family, had dinner and participated in a trivia night at the Hurlstone Park RSL Club with his parents and sister. During the course of the evening, he received a telephone call and at about 10.30pm, left the Club alone and drove a red Ford Laser to the home of John Hohaia’s mother at 52 Lucerne Street, Belmore. When he arrived, John Hohaia, John Hohaia’s mother, the appellant and Nicole Janes were present and sitting around a table drinking alcohol. The evidence was that everyone, with the exception of Nicole Janes, was affected by alcohol or cannabis, or both, at the time that the deceased arrived. George Choueiri was also at the premises, although the evidence is unclear as to whether he arrived with the deceased, or was already there when the deceased arrived.  
     
      
       
      The Crown evidence as to the appellant’s involvement in the offence 
       
      
    10 There was no dispute that the deceased was at 52 Lucerne Street, Belmore late on 2 December 2003, nor was there any dispute that the appellant and John Hohaia were also there. The deceased’s father made telephone contact with the deceased at 1.35am on 3 December, at which time the deceased said he would be home “soon”. At 2.24am, nearly the entire credit balance of $190 was withdrawn from the deceased’s National Australia Bank account at an ATM located at Haldon Street, Lakemba. At approximately 3.15am, Barbara Kitsios returned home from her job as a cleaner in the city, intending to visit her boyfriend who lived in a block of units next door to 52 Lucerne Street. She knew John Hohaia, and observed him walking drunkenly along Lucerne Street, towards her, with another man who, by the description she gave, was the deceased. Barbara Kitsios observed John Hohaia acting in an angry and threatening manner towards the deceased. 
     
      
    11 Barbara Kitsios also gave evidence that she saw the appellant’s white van in the street and that it was parked with its back end towards the properties on 52 Lucerne Street. She was familiar both with the van and the appellant as the person who drove the van. She said the van had a very loud motor, with which she was also familiar. Barbara Kitsios went to her boyfriend’s unit, where she went to bed. At about 4am, while lying in bed, she said she heard what sounded like a fight. She then heard the van being driven off very fast. Later, in the morning of 3 December, Barbara Kitsios saw a pool of blood on the footpath outside 52 Lucerne Street. Presumptive tests for blood undertaken by police later that day on several stains on the footpath and in the forecourt of 52 Lucerne Street reacted positively.  
     
      
    12 The deceased’s body was found on the afternoon of 3 December in his car in a carpark at Wiley Park. A local resident had observed the car in the same position at 5.15am. It was the Crown case that the deceased had been killed sometime between 3.15am and 5.15am.  
     
      
    13 Nicole Janes, who was at the premises at 52 Lucerne Street when the deceased arrived, gave evidence that there was a dispute between the deceased and John Hohaia. The disagreement developed into an assault when John Hohaia, without warning, started punching the deceased, cutting his lip. This evidence was corroborated by the post-mortem examination, which indicated that the deceased had lacerations to the upper and lower lip.  
     
      
    14 Nicole Janes also gave evidence that the appellant joined in hitting and yelling at the deceased. She said that the appellant and John Hohaia then took the deceased outside the front of the house, where they punched and kicked him all over his body and took his wallet. She also gave evidence that they dragged the deceased to his car and placed him in it and that the appellant drove away in it. They returned sometime later, at which time the appellant dragged the deceased out of the car by the hair and the appellant and John Hohaia resumed hitting and kicking him.  
     
      
    15 John Hohaia gave evidence at trial, in which he admitted grabbing the deceased by the collar and punching him at least six times to the face, with both fists, either inside or outside the house. He otherwise did not remember the events of the evening. 
     
      
    16 George Choueiri gave evidence that he slept at 52 Lucerne Street on the night of 2/3 December 2003, but said he saw very little. However, he stated that the appellant returned to the premises at about 6 or 7am and that he had changed his clothes and shoes from the previous night.  
     
      
    17 Evidence was also given by Vinita Ram, who, at the time of the offences, was in a relationship and living together with the appellant at Lakemba. The house was shared by two other women. Vinita Ram gave evidence that she saw the appellant on several occasions on the night of 2/3 December. She was unable to specify the times of each occasion. On the first occasion, she said the appellant arrived at her home driving a red four-door car, possibly a Ford Laser. The appellant did not get out of the vehicle on that occasion and Vinita Ram came out of the house and spoke to the appellant. She said another person was in the car with the appellant. The description identified the other person as the deceased.  
     
      
    18 The appellant returned about an hour or two later and on that occasion, the appellant came into the unit. On this occasion, the appellant informed Vinita Ram that “Alex [the deceased]” was the person who had been in the car earlier and that he had been “a smart arse” and that John Hohaia had “cracked him”. The appellant also told Vinita Ram that they had locked the deceased in a room and that every few minutes John Hohaia would bash him. The appellant further told Vinita Ram that they had taken the deceased’s camera from him and he showed her a small chrome digital camera; that they had taken his mobile phone, and that the appellant had taken the deceased to an ATM and made him draw all his money out of his account. Vinita Ram recollected that the amount involved was about $200. The appellant further told her that they were going to make the deceased sign over his car the next day. The appellant left, saying he was going back to John Hohaia’s house. 
     
      
    19 The third visit was about an hour or two later when the appellant reappeared at the unit. He took Vinita Ram and their two flatmates for a joyride in a red Ford Laser motor vehicle.  
     
      
    20 The final occasion that Vinita Ram saw the appellant that night was an hour or two after the previous occasion. Vinita Ram said that it was at about sunrise. She described the appellant as being “freaked out”. He told her that he “wasn’t sure Alex was alive or dead” and that they had “taken him to the park, bashed him and … they bashed him there and they were kicking into him and they left him there”. Vinita Ram, the appellant and a friend drove to Wiley Park where the red car was parked. Vinita Ram saw the deceased’s body inside the car. She described it as appearing “purple” and being in a slumped position. She told the appellant that she did not think the deceased was alive. She suggested that they call an ambulance or make an anonymous call, but the appellant said not to do so. 
     
      
    21 They returned home and on Vinita Ram’s evidence, the appellant then showered and washed his clothes. Shortly afterwards, the appellant, Vinita Ram and the other two girls moved to another unit, because the appellant said he did not want anyone staying at his house after what had happened. The unit to which they moved to was leased by Jihad Moussa, who vacated it for them. Jihad Moussa owned the bakery at which the appellant claimed he was working at the time of the murder. 
     
      
    22 Evidence was also given by Bianca Kafer, one of the two flatmates who lived with the appellant and Vinita Ram. Bianca Kafer gave evidence of the occasion when the appellant took Vinita Ram, herself and the other flatmate for a joyride in the red Ford Laser. She also recalled the appellant returning that night looking a bit shocked and with a dark stain on his boots which she thought was blood. She also gave evidence that the appellant placed his boots in the washing machine later that morning. Bianca Kafer said that the three girls questioned the appellant as to what had happened and when he eventually replied, he said “I think he’s dead”.  
     
      
    23 The third flatmate, was not identified other than as “Abby”, and Bianca Kafer did not know her present whereabouts.  
     
      
       
      The alibi evidence 
       
      
    24 A Notice of Alibi dated 30 January 2006 was served upon the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 150 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (the Criminal Procedure Act). The Notice stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “That at his trial, the accused Mostafa Abdul-Kader intends to rely upon the alibi that from about 1 a.m. until about 10:00 a.m. on 3 December 2003 he was working at Moussa’s Bakery and Pizzas at 137A Haldon Street, Lakemba in the state of New South Wales.” 
        
       
      
    25 The Notice stated that the appellant intended to call Robert Dibb and Jihad Moussa in support of the alibi.  
     
      
       
      Evidence in support of the alibi 
       
      
    26 Jihad Moussa did not give evidence.  
     
      
    27 In his evidence at trial, Robert Dibb said that he had been at his home at 53 Barremma Road, Lakemba, on the night of 2 December 2003 (Appeal Tr 834 ff White Book 1515ff). He said that at around midnight, he drove to a 7/11 store on Canterbury Road, Lakemba, to buy something to eat. It took about five to ten minutes to drive from his place to the 7/11 store. He said that he ate the food in the carpark of the 7/11 store, had a cigarette and then commenced the drive home. He described the route that he took home, which included travelling along Haldon Street. Robert Dibb said that at the corner of the Boulevarde and Haldon Street, he saw the appellant. He said that this was between 12.30am and 1am. He said that he beeped his horn when he saw the appellant and the appellant waved at him and asked him what he was doing. He said that he explained that he had just been to get something to eat and asked the appellant what he was doing. Robert Dibb said that the appellant said he had just come back from a party and was on the way to work at the Bakery. Robert Dibb offered the appellant a lift, but he declined it. 
     
      
    28 In his examination-in-chief, Robert Dibb said that he became aware that the appellant had been charged in relation to the death of a person about a week after the night that he had spoken to him as described above. He said that he had read about it in the Torch, a weekly local newspaper circulated in the Lakemba area every Wednesday. Robert Dibb said that, about a week after he saw the item in the Torch, he spoke to the appellant’s father about what he had observed (Appeal book 1522, Tr 841).  
     
      
    29 In cross-examination, it became apparent that Robert Dibb had made a statement to a solicitor on 29 July 2004 about the events of that night and that he had been given a copy of his statement by the solicitor at that time (Appeal book 1526). The Crown Prosecutor cross-examined Robert Dibb about when he had seen the news item in the Torch. The cross-examination was based upon the assumption (which was correct in fact) that the appellant was arrested at about 5pm on 10 December 2003. The edition of the Torch for that week would have been already printed and distributed at that time. The Crown Prosecutor thus suggested that the article Robert Dibb had read must have been in the edition of the Torch published on 17 December 2003. Robert Dibb agreed with that “possibility” (Appeal book 1530).  
     
      
    30 The transcript of the cross-examination continues over a number of pages and question by question, was directed at undermining Robert Dibb’s recollection of the date that he saw the appellant in the early hours of a Wednesday morning (transcript 846-851; Appeal book 1527-1532). There was then some general cross-examination, which is set out below, of what might be described as of an ‘exploratory’ nature, culminating in a series of questions as to how Robert Dibb was able to fix the time and date that he saw the appellant as being between 12.30am and 1am on 3 December 2003:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You can actually remember today seeing the clock and the time that was on it [being a reference to looking at the clock on the dashboard of his car]? 
         
        A. Roughly about that time. 
         
         
        Q. What time do you say it was? 
         
        A. At that time it was about maybe between 12.30 and 1. 
         
         
        Q. Would you accept there is quite a difference between 12.30 and 1 – would you accept that? 
         
        A. What do you mean by that? 
         
         
        Q. Why do you say it was between 12.30 and 1 if you looked at the clock? 
         
        A. Because I can’t exactly remember the exact time. 
         
         
        Q.  
        You say, do you, that when you spoke to [the appellant’s] father you could remember this incident being Wednesday morning the 3 [sic] December because you could just remember it, right? 
         
        A.  
        I remember going to the 7/11 that day. 
         
         
        Q. He said nothing to you to make you aware it was Wednesday the 3 [sic] December? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. That was the day it was alleged he had been guilty of some crime? 
         
        A. No, nothing whatsoever. 
         
         
        Q. And you didn’t learn about him being arrested and charged until you read about it in the newspaper? 
         
        A. That is correct.” (Emphasis added) (Tr 861, Appeal book 1542).  
        
       
      
    31 Robert Dibb was then cross-examined about what the appellant was wearing, and responded that he was wearing a green collared shirt, but he could not remember whether it was short or long sleeved and long pants, but he could not remember their colour. He was then asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q.  
        You accept it is possible that you saw him on some other day – some other morning and not Wednesday the 3 [sic] December? 
         
        A.  
        No I am sure it was Wednesday. 
         
         
        Q. You couldn’t be mistaken? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. You couldn’t be in error? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Why are you so sure? 
         
        A. Because I am. 
         
         
        Q. Why? 
         
        A. Because I remember that day. 
         
         
        Q. Why do you remember that day? 
         
        A. Because I know what I was doing that night. 
         
         
        Q. Did somebody tell you it was Wednesday 3 December that it was alleged that he was at a house where the deceased had died? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Did the solicitor ever explain that to you? 
         
        A. No he didn’t. 
         
         
        Q. But you couldn’t possibly be mistaken you say? 
         
        A. No.” (Tr 863, Appeal book 1544) 
        
       
      
    32 There then followed a short number of questions about Robert Dibb’s friendship with the appellant and he was asked whether the appellant’s father had paid Robert Dibb’s expenses with the solicitor. 
     
      
    33 That was the end of his cross-examination. In re-examination, Robert Dibb was asked to identify the statement that he had made on 29 July 2004 and the tender of that document was then sought. The tender was objected to and was eventually rejected by his Honour. It is the rejection of the tender of that statement that is the subject of the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      The prior consistent statement 
       
      
    34 The prior consistent statement commenced routinely with Robert Dibb’s name and address. The first paragraph then stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “On Wednesday 3rd December 2003, at approximately 12:00 midnight I was at my house at 53 Barremma Road, Lakemba.” (Appeal book 506) 
        
       
      
    35 The statement continued that, having felt hungry, he decided to go out to eat and so drove to the 7/11 store on Canterbury Road, Lakemba. He described how, on his way home, between 12.30am and 1am, whilst driving along Haldon Street, he saw the appellant and they had a conversation which was, relevantly, in the same terms as the conversation about which he had given evidence.  
     
      
       
      Basis upon which the prior consistent statement was sought to be tendered 
       
      
    36 Counsel for the appellant sought to have the statement admitted under s 108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act. As the heading to the section explains, s 108 is an exception to s 102 of the Evidence Act, which is described as “The credibility rule”. Section 102 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence that is relevant only to a witness’s credibility is not admissible.” 
        
       
      
    37 Section 108 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “108 Exception: re-establishing credibility 
         
         
        (1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in re-examination of a witness. 
         
         
        …  
         
         
        (3) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if:  
         
         
          
          (a) evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or re-constructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion, 
          
         
         
          
          and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    38 Leave was required under s 192 of the Evidence Act before the statement could be adduced in evidence. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “192 Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms 
         
         
        (1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit. 
         
         
        (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:  
         
         
          
          (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and 
          
         
         
          
          (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and 
          
         
         
        (d) the nature of the proceeding, and 
         
         
          
          (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Trial judge’s reasons for refusing the tender of the prior consistent statement 
       
      
    39 The trial judge, after having set out the relevant portions of Robert Dibb’s evidence, including portions of the cross-examination, referred to ss 108 and 192 of the Evidence Act. His Honour observed at [18], as acknowledged by the appellant’s counsel, Mr Scragg, that the Crown had not suggested that Robert Dibb had fabricated his evidence. Rather, this was a case where the Crown proposed to suggest in its final address that Robert Dibb had either identified the relevant date of 3 December 2003 as a result of suggestion by some person, or that his evidence was the product of reconstruction. His Honour, at [24], posed the question: 
     
      
       
        
        “How does the making of a statement seven months after the event, in terms which simply repeat the assertion that [Robert Dibb] saw [the appellant] on Wednesday 3 December 2003, assist in determining whether his evidence was the product of reconstruction or suggestion?” 
        
       
      
    40 His Honour determined that the statement did not assist the determination. He observed that the other material in the statement, that is, the material apart from the assertion of the date in para 1, was not the subject of serious challenge by the Crown, such as to raise an issue of credibility. His Honour further observed that insofar as Robert Dibb referred to the date of 3 December 2003, the statement did not add to his evidence. It neither enlarged upon his thought processes as to how he knew some weeks after the event that the date he had seen the appellant was 3 December 2003, nor how he appreciated that seeing the appellant was relevant to the charge which the appellant faced. His Honour concluded at [24]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The statement does no more than the jury would infer having heard Mr Dibb's evidence, namely, that he had told the solicitor on 29 July 2004 that he saw [the appellant] on Wednesday 3 December 2003 between 12.30 and 1.00 am. I doubt whether the jury would get any assistance from the statement in determining whether in fact Mr Dibb had arrived at the date by a process of reconstruction or suggestion.” 
        
       
      
    41 His Honour then addressed each of the sub paras of s 192(2). For present purposes, the only provision to which reference needs to be made is s 192(2)(b). His Honour determined in relation to that provision that, for the same reasons as given in Graham v The Queen [1998] HCA 61; (1998) 195 CLR 606, no particular unfairness attached to either party because the statement did not really address the credibility attack, nor assist in resolving the issue of reconstruction or suggestion.  
     
      
       
      The law 
       
      
    42 The application of s 108 of the Evidence Act was considered by the High Court in Graham v The Queen. That case involved a charge of sexual assault by a father upon his daughter. Evidence was admitted of a complaint made by the complainant to a friend some six years after the alleged assault. The High Court held that the evidence of the complaint was not admissible under s 66 of the Evidence Act, because it had not been made at the time when the facts represented in the complaint were “fresh in the memory of the [representor]”: see at 608 [3]. The question then became whether the evidence of the complaint was admissible on the basis that s 108 applied. The cross-examination of the witness as to when the complaint was made was directed to a suggestion that the evidence of the complainant had been fabricated. (It was not suggested that there had been a reconstruction of evidence, or that the complainant’s evidence had been affected by suggestion.) Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ stated at 609 [8]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In exercising the discretion under s 108(3) to permit the adducing of evidence of a prior consistent statement, it is important to bear two matters in mind. First, s 108 creates an exception to the ‘credibility rule’ - the rule that evidence that is relevant  
        only 
         to a witness's credibility is not admissible (s 102). Second, it is important to identify how the evidence relates to the statutory premise for its admission. Whether, if admissible, the complaint becomes evidence of the truth of what is asserted is not relevant to the exercise of the discretion to give leave under s 108.  
        The exercise of the discretion under s 108 depends upon the effect of the evidence on the witness's credibility: here, the suggestion of fabrication 
        .” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    43 Their Honours then, at 609-610 [9], asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “How does the making of a complaint six years after the events bear upon that question?” 
        
       
       
      They continued: 
       
       
        
        “Unless the making of the complaint can be said to assist the resolution of that question, the evidence of complaint is not important (cf s 192(2)(c)) and would do nothing except add to the length of the hearing (cf s 192(2)(a)). And in this case, it is by no means clear that the making of a complaint six years after the event does assist in deciding whether the complainant had fabricated her evidence. Although trial counsel for the appellant suggested to the complainant, by his last question in cross-examination, that she was ‘making it all up’ the allegation of fabrication of evidence did not loom large in the trial. No question was put, and no answer was given, from which the time of alleged fabrication could be identified. The complaint having been made in 1994, and it having led at once to the start of police investigations, it may be doubted that a jury could gain assistance from its making in deciding whether the complainant had fabricated her story.” 
        
       
      
    44 Their Honours’ remarks are equally applicable to a case where the allegation is, not of fabrication, but of reconstruction or suggestion. The question to be asked, therefore, is: how does the statement which says no more than, on the specified date and time, the witness saw ‘x’ and had a conversation with him in ‘y’ terms, help resolve the question whether that statement was made in those terms because of a suggestion made to the witness or because it was a reconstruction? 
     
      
    45 The application of s 108 has been considered a number of times by this Court. In R v Ali [2000] NSWCCA 177, the Court was concerned with the admission under s 108(3)(a) of the evidence of a Department of Community Services (DOCS) worker of a complaint of sexual assault made to her by the complainant. The witness’ evidence was not admissible under s 66 of the Evidence Act because it did not have sufficient contemporaneity with the alleged assault. Sperling J (Priestley JA and Foster AJA agreeing) observed that the evidence was admitted under s 108(3)(a) as evidence capable of re-establishing the complainant’s credibility in regard to the possible effect of prior inconsistent representations that had been made in interviews with DOCS officers. His Honour also observed, at [46], in respect of s 108(3)(b): 
     
      
       
        
        “Where it is or will be suggested that a witness has fabricated evidence (or that the evidence is reconstructed, or the result of suggestion),  
        a consistent out-of-court statement 
         made as part of the train of events leading to the trial for the offence  
        may not be admissible because it adds nothing to what is said by the complainant in evidence at the trial 
        . In such a case, the out-of-court statement does not rationally answer the suggestion of fabrication, reconstruction or suggestion in relation to the evidence given by the complainant in court. The out-of-court statement merely tells the same story in materially the same context as the evidence given in court. It does nothing for the complainant’s credibility that the same story has been told out of court in such a case.” (Emphases added) 
        
       
      
    46 For the reasons already stated, these comments can be applied directly to this case. 
     
      
    47 See also R v DBG [2002] NSWCCA 328; (2002) 133 A Crim R 227 at 239-240, [50]-[51]. 
     
      
    48 In R v MDB [2005] NSWCCA 354, the application of s 108(3) was again considered in the context of a complaint of sexual assault. The appellant had been convicted of sexually assaulting the 11 year old complainant on a camping trip. The complainant did not make any complaint at the time. However, six months later, when there was a suggestion of another camping trip, the complainant complained to his mother and to some friends that he did not wish to go camping with the appellant, because the previous time he had been camping with the appellant, he had been subject to the sexual abuse of which the appellant was convicted. On appeal, the appellant claimed that the trial judge had erred in admitting the evidence of the complaint which, as I have said, was made six months after the sexual assault the subject of the conviction. The Court rejected the appellant’s challenge to the admission of the evidence. That case also involved an allegation of fabrication. Simpson J, with whom Adams and Johnson JJ agreed, observed at [23] that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it will often be the case that evidence of a prior consistent statement will assist in the determination of credibility where, for example, the suggestion of fabrication is tied to a time or event or circumstance, and the prior consistent statement can be shown to predate that time or event or circumstance.” 
        
       
      
    49 Her Honour pointed out, however, that s 108(3)(b) was not limited to that situation. In the case the subject of her Honour’s consideration, she considered that the circumstances in which the complainant made his complaint, namely, when the prospect of a second camping trip arose with the appellant, were significant. Her Honour considered that the evidence of the prior consistent statement, which included an explanation as to why and when he made his disclosure, was compelling evidence in rebutting the suggestion of fabrication, by explaining the context and circumstances in which he made the complaint. 
     
      
    50 In the present case, there was nothing in the prior consistent statement that explained how it was that Robert Dibb remembered or otherwise identified the date on which he said he had the conversation with the appellant as being 3 December 2003. The statement merely stated that on that date, he saw the appellant, explained why he was driving around at that time and then set out the conversation he said he had with the appellant. The attack made upon Robert Dibb in cross-examination was an attack upon the reliability of his identification of the date as 3 December 2003. In other words, there was nothing in the statement that would help repel the suggestion contained in the Crown cross-examination that the date was remembered because of reconstruction, or because of suggestion. In those circumstances, I am of the opinion that the trial judge was correct in concluding that the statement did no more than confirm Robert Dibb’s evidence that he had told a solicitor on 29 July 2004 that he saw the appellant on 3 December 2003 between 12.30 and 1am. I agree with his Honour’s assessment that the jury would not get any assistance from the statement in determining whether Robert Dibb had arrived at the date by a process of reconstruction or suggestion. Likewise, his Honour’s findings on the matters under s 192 of the Evidence Act were open to him and in my opinion, were correct. 
     
      
    51 That should be the end of the appeal on conviction. However, the manner in which senior counsel for the appellant approached the appeal was to contend that the Crown case was not limited to contesting the reliability of Robert Dibb’s evidence, but also challenged its veracity, that is, it was said the Crown case was that Robert Dibb’s evidence was a fabrication. It was then suggested that a prior consistent statement, made some seven months after the trial, was likely to assist the jury in determining whether the statement was a fabrication. This submission requires a consideration of the Crown’s final address to the jury. 
     
      
    52 In his address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor asserted that the jury should not accept the evidence supporting the appellant’s alibi. In about a page and a half, he dealt with Robert Dibb’s evidence. He focussed on the way in which Robert Dibb had fixed the date of 3 December as being the date that he saw the appellant. After briefly analysing the evidence, the Crown Prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is possible that it was the day before or two days before [the appellant’s] arrest, in December 2003 that Mr Dibb did see him  
        if he saw him 
        . The question is this: How is he able to say it was 3 December when he fixes it by reference to reading something in the  
        Torch 
        ?” (Emphasis added) (Appeal book 1744) 
        
       
      
    53 The Crown Prosecutor then referred to some of the cross-examination, where he had challenged Robert Dibb as to how he could say it was 3 December that he saw the appellant and referred the jury to the following questions and answers: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. How do you say it was 3 December? 
         
        A. Because it was 3 December, are you not listening to me? 
         
         
        Q. But why was it 3 December? 
         
        A. Because I know it was 3 December. 
         
         
        Q. But what distinguishes 3 December from any other day?” 
        
       
      
    54 The Crown Prosecutor continued with his address as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[Robert Dibb] was unemployed, he’d spent the night on the computer and on the internet, got hungry and he went up and got something to eat.” 
        
       
      
    55 The Crown Prosecutor returned to the question as to how Robert Dibb fixed the date as 3 December. He then posed the question for the jury, “Where does [sic] Mr Dibb’s allegiances lie?”  The Crown Prosecutor reminded the jury that their assessment of Robert Dibb as a witness was entirely a matter for them, but concluded, “is he truly objective, independent, or do his allegiances lie a little towards the accused?” The Crown Prosecutor again returned to how it was that Robert Dibb was able to remember the time and the date and pointed out that in any event, his description of the accused was not even consistent with the picture the accused painted of himself, which was of someone so intoxicated that it took nearly an hour for him to get from the premises in Lucerne Street to where Robert Dibb was, a distance that would normally take 12 to 14 minutes to walk.  
     
      
    56 The Crown Prosecutor concluded his address relating to Robert Dibb in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “If Mr Dibb is telling the truth and he did see the accused early one morning, was it 3 December? In my submission it is inconsistent with all of the other evidence.” (Appeal book 1745) 
        
       
      
    57 In my opinion, in his address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor did raise the question of fabrication, although the primary focus was on the question of how it was that Robert Dibb could have remembered that date. However, the question of admissibility of the prior consistent statement was determined prior to the address to the jury. The question is, therefore, whether the fact that the Crown assertion of fabrication came in the final address had any relevance to his Honour’s determination. The appellant argued, as I understand it, that it was apparent, even at the time that his Honour was dealing with the admissibility of the statement, that there was to be a challenge to its truthfulness (as opposed to reliability) and that the actual address to the jury confirmed this was so. His Honour’s error, therefore, was to fail to take into account this aspect of the challenge to Robert Dibb’s evidence when determining the admissibility of the statement. This submission thus leads back to a consideration of the manner in which the application for admission of the statement was approached by both parties. 
     
      
    58 Counsel for the appellant submitted to the trial judge that it was apparent from the cross-examination that the challenge that was being made to Robert Dibb’s evidence was not merely as to how it was that he was able to fix the date as 3 December, but was also a challenge to the alibi itself. (Tr 968, White book 1650). It was contended that the Crown would invite the jury to find either, that this chance meeting on 3 December never happened or, if it did, it happened on another occasion and not 3 December (Appeal book 1574, Tr 892). 
     
      
    59 The trial judge specifically put to the appellant’s counsel at trial that, as he had understood the cross-examination, it was limited to the issue as to how it was that Robert Dibb was able to come up with the date 3 December. Counsel agreed that the date was the key issue in this context. His Honour then raised with counsel how it was that the statement addressed that matter. In short, his Honour asked the appellant’s counsel at trial to deal with the very question which is at the heart of an application under s 108(3), namely, what in the statement revealed Robert Dibb’s thought processes as to how it was that he recollected that date (Tr 893, Appeal book 1575). Counsel’s response at that stage was simply that this was evidence that had probative weight and it showed that that was a date that Robert Dibb had remembered between the time he had spoken to the appellant’s father sometime in December 2003 and the time he gave the statement eight months later (Tr 894, Appeal book 1576). 
     
      
    60 The trial judge asked the Crown Prosecutor to identify what submission was ultimately going to be made to the jury in respect of the statement. The Crown Prosecutor responded that, at that stage, he had not given it any thought. (It should be remarked that the first that the Crown knew of the existence of this statement was in cross-examination of Robert Dibb on the day before.) The Crown Prosecutor then said 
     
      
       
        
        “I would think that I would be asking the jury to consider whether, in fact, it was 3 December that this witness saw the accused.” 
        
       
       
      He added that it was a matter for the jury to determine whether or not they accepted Robert Dibb as a witness of truth. If they did, then there was a question as to whether he had correctly remembered the date (Tr 969-970, Appeal book 1651-1652).  
       
      
    61 The trial judge, during the course of argument on the application (to the extent that comments made by a trial judge in the course of argument may be relevant) remarked that he had no doubt that the Crown would invite the jury not to accept Robert Dibb’s evidence. His Honour pointed out, however, that he expected that the attack on Robert Dibb as a witness of truth would not be based on a challenge to his evidence that he went to a solicitor on 29 July 2004 and made a statement that identified 3 December as the date he saw the appellant walking to the bakery.  
     
      
    62 His Honour’s assessment of the Crown’s anticipated approach to Robert Dibb’s evidence was correct. Indeed, it was as stated by the Crown in the course of the submissions on the s 108 application. The Crown Prosecutor said that he was going to suggest to the jury that Robert Dibb should not be accepted as a witness of truth. As the passage of his address to the jury quoted above reveals, that suggestion was made, but only in the most general of terms. The real challenge to Robert Dibb’s evidence was how it was that he could fix the date as 3 December.  
     
      
    63 In my opinion, the trial judge did not err in his approach to the determination of the issue before him. The exchange between his Honour and counsel during the course of the application reveals that his Honour clearly understood the basis of the challenge to Robert Dibb’s evidence, namely, its reliability, but was also alive to the likelihood of a general challenge to his truthfulness as a witness. In his determination, his Honour confined his remarks to the former, that being the essential challenge to the evidence. I do not consider, in the circumstances, his Honour erred by not addressing his attention to the question whether the statement assisted in determining whether the evidence was fabricated. However, even if his Honour should have addressed that question, the answer would have been the same. There was nothing in the statement, or in the circumstances in which it was made, that would have assisted in the determination of the question whether it was fabricated. 
     
      
    64 Senior counsel for the appellant also placed some emphasis upon the importance of this evidence to the appellant’s case. This effectively was a submission directed to the operation of s 192. The alibi evidence was, of course, fundamental to the appellant’s defence. However, the making of a statement eight months later in which nothing more was said than what was contained in the evidence was not important, in the sense required by s 192. But, in any event, for the reasons that the trial judge expressed, this evidence did not qualify for admission under s 108. In those circumstances, the appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Operation of the proviso 
       
      
    65 Even if I am wrong and his Honour should have admitted the prior consistent statement made by Robert Dibb on 29 July 2004, I am of the opinion that this is a case in which the proviso should apply: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) s 6(2). This was a strong Crown case. I have referred above in summary form to some, but not all, of the evidence. It is correct that there were some inconsistencies in Vinita Ram’s statement in particular. Likewise, there was a basis upon which her evidence could be open to challenge in that it was only after her relationship with the appellant ended that she told the police what became her evidence at trial. Nonetheless, there was a significant body of other evidence at trial which corroborated her evidence. The jury were entitled to accept her evidence and given its corroboration, it was likely to be correct, in all relevant aspects.  
     
      
    66 In my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    67 The appellant and John Hohaia were sentenced by Kirby J on 5 September 2006.  
     
      
    68 The appellant was sentenced in respect of the murder charge to a term of 21 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years 9 months commencing on 10 December 2004 and expiring on 9 September 2020. His Honour imposed a concurrent sentence of 18 months in respect of the charge of robbery in company, commencing on 10 December 2004 and expiring on 9 June 2006. 
     
      
    69 John Hohaia was sentenced in respect of the murder charge to a term of 24 years imprisonment commencing on 4 December 2003 with a non-parole period of 18 years commencing on 4 December 2003 and expiring on 3 December 2021. His Honour imposed a concurrent sentence of a fixed term of 18 months in respect of the charge of robbery in company. John Hohaia was also sentenced in respect of an unassociated charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. His Honour imposed a concurrent term of 9 months in respect of that charge.  
     
      
    70 The appellant seeks leave to appeal against sentence on the ground that there was a lack of proper proportion between the sentence imposed on him and that imposed on John Hohaia, whose objective criminality and moral culpability was significantly higher: ground 2(a). The appellant contended that a different, less severe, sentence was warranted and ought to have been imposed: ground 2(b). 
     
      
    71 Kirby J found that John Hohaia was the principal aggressor and was primarily responsible for the battering sustained by the deceased (Remarks on Sentence [15]). His Honour found that the appellant was physically involved in the bashing of the deceased, although he was unable to precisely determine at what point the appellant engaged in the bashing, other than the evidence that he had attacked and kicked the deceased outside the house at 52 Lucerne Street. His Honour found, beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant physically struck the deceased, but also that he played a much lesser role than John Hohaia in the brutality. His Honour held that the appellant was present and offering encouragement at various stages of the assault, including at the end.  
     
      
    72 His Honour found that John Hohaia’s motive in attacking the deceased was envy in respect of the advantages that the deceased enjoyed, including having a job, prospects, paying off his car and coming from a loving family. His Honour was unable to articulate any satisfactory motives that the appellant might have had in attacking the deceased. His Honour found that John Hohaia’s offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness and in the case of the appellant, who played a lesser, but significant role, that his crime fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    73 John Hohaia was 18 years and 5 months of age when he committed the crimes. His Honour accepted that he had shown, albeit recent, contrition, and that he had some prospects of rehabilitation, although that assessment was guarded. John Hohaia had a prior criminal history, mainly for driving offences and at the time of sentence for these offences, did not have convictions for offences of violence, although it is to be remembered that he was sentenced for the additional assault charge at the same time that these sentences were imposed.  
     
      
    74 His Honour considered that because of John Hohaia’s youth, it was appropriate to depart from and moderate the standard non-parole period of 20 years: see the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act Div 1A.  
     
      
    75 The appellant was also young at the time of the commission of this offence, being aged 21 years, and his Honour took that into account. He did not, at any time, show contrition, at all times maintaining his innocence. The appellant had a prior criminal history, including driving offences, offences of dishonesty and an offence of assault for which he was fined a relatively modest sum. He was on a two year bond at the time of the commission of these offences, which, as his Honour stated, was a matter of aggravation. (Remarks on sentence [50]).  
     
      
    76 At the time of his arrest on 10 December 2003 for the murder of the deceased, the appellant had outstanding a charge against him for the supply of methylamphetamine, for which he had been arrested on 19 June 2003. He was tried for that offence in the District Court before a jury in May 2004 and was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 32 months commencing on 11 May 2004 with a non-parole period of 20 months commencing on that date. The appellant was also serving a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing 10 December 2003 and concluding on 9 June 2004 for three other offences, namely, two offences of using a false instrument with intent and one offence of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. I need to return to these matters as it was submitted that his Honour failed to properly have regard to the appellant’s existing sentence when setting the commencement date of the sentence and for that reason also the appellant had a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    77 His Honour accepted that the appellant had periodically suffered from depression following his mother’s death when he was aged 16. There had also been also episodes of self-harm and a history of drug and alcohol dependency. His Honour also considered that the appellant’s prospects of rehabilitation were guarded, but may be reasonable, should he abstain from drugs and alcohol. 
     
      
    78 There was no finding of special circumstances.  
     
      
    79 Leaving to one side the complications that arise from the 6 month sentence that commenced on 10 December 2003, I do not consider that the appellant has a basis to feel aggrieved at the sentence imposed upon him. His involvement in the offence lasted throughout the night, although there were times when the deceased was only in the company of Mr Hohaia. The appellant was found to have physically assaulted the deceased and to have encouraged Mr Hohaia in what was clearly an horrendous and extended period of physical attack. His sentence was less than that imposed on Mr Hohaia and it is apparent that his Honour appropriately reflected the different role played by the appellant in the lesser sentence imposed on him. Finally, even though both were young men at the time of the commission of the offence, Mr Hohaia was only 18 years old and of limited intellect, whereas the appellant was 21 years of age. In Roberts v R [2007] NSWCCA 112, Barr J commented that a difference in age between two men in their early 20s, in that case, of four years, was significant. That comment is relevant here (although there was only approximately three years age difference), especially given that Mr Hohaia was only 18 at the time of the offence and of limited intelligence. 
     
      
    80 That leaves the question as to whether his Honour failed to give proper effect to the pre-sentence custody in such a way as to give rise to a sense of grievance. To understand this point, it is necessary to restate the manner in which his Honour imposed the sentence and the effect that had on the ratio of the non-parole period to the total sentence. It is also relevant that, in the case of Mr Hohaia, the ratio of the non-parole period to the total period was 75 per cent, a ratio that is sometimes referred to as the statutory norm. 
     
      
    81 It will be remembered that the appellant was arrested and taken into custody on 10 December 2003. The total sentence imposed upon the appellant for the murder offence was 21 years, with a non-parole period of 15 years 9 months. His Honour ordered that the sentence commence on 10 December 2004, with the non-parole period to expire on 9 September 2020. The sentence was partially accumulated upon the sentence for the drug offence of which he was convicted in May 2004, of 3 years 8 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 8 months commencing on 11 May 2004. The appellant was also serving the 6 month fixed term of imprisonment referred to above. 
     
      
    82 The trial judge recognised that the sentencing of the appellant, and in particular, the setting of the commencement date, was complicated by the fact that the appellant was already serving a sentence at the time that his Honour was imposing the sentence for the murder offence. His Honour also observed that the appellant was entitled to have credit for the five months that he was in custody between 10 December 2003 and 10 May 2004 and also some adjustment in respect of the sentence for the drug offence that was imposed on 11 May 2004. His Honour considered, therefore, that it was appropriate to commence the sentence from 10 December 2004. His Honour then stated the total sentence he was imposing, namely, 21 years, and specified the non-parole period of 15 years 9 months.  
     
      
    83 Because of the argument that has arisen on this point, it is appropriate to set out the terms in which his Honour articulated the sentence that he imposed. His Honour said at [75] of his Remarks on Sentence that he sentenced the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        “… to imprisonment for 21 years with a non-parole period of 15 years and 9 months. Making due allowance for time in custody, but also taking into account the sentence you are now serving, your sentence will commence on 10 December 2004. Your non parole period will commence on 10 December 2004 and will expire on 9 September 2020.” 
        
       
      
    84 The appellant contends that this approach to the sentence indicates error in at least two ways. First, it was submitted that an accumulation on an existing sentence constitutes special circumstances justifying an adjustment of the non-parole period: see R v Close (1992) 31 NSWLR 743; R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58. It was not contended that his Honour was bound to find special circumstances but, when his failure to do so was coupled with the next matter of which complaint is made, it was apparent, it was said, that there was a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    85 The second matter of which complaint is made is that although his Honour stated that he took into account the period of pre-sentence custody, it was submitted that the preferable course is to deduct the period of pre-sentence custody from the non-parole period by backdating the sentence.  
     
      
    86 This approach was endorsed most recently by this court in R v Newman; R v Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102; (2004) 145 A Crim R 361. In that case, Howie J (McColl JA and Shaw J agreeing) described as “trite law” the principle that a sentencing court must take into account the period served in pre-sentence custody where that period is referable to the offence for which the sentence is being passed. Indeed, it is a matter of statutory prescription: see the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ss 24(a) and 47(3).  
     
      
    87 Howie J, at 367 [22], referred to the decision of this Court in R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588, where Street CJ stated at 590: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is desirable sentencing practice that, where there has been a period of pre-sentence custody  
        exclusively 
         referable to the offences for which sentence is being passed, the commencement of the sentence (and the non-parole … period) should be back-dated for an equivalent period. This is to be preferred to a process of assessing the proper sentence (and non-parole … period) and allowing, as it were, a discount in consequence of the pre-sentence custody.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    88 His Honour observed that a difficulty arose in a case where the pre-sentence custody did not continue unbroken to the date of sentence. His Honour stated at 368 [26]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In such a case the court is faced with two options: it can simply state that the pre-sentence custody is being taken into account and reduce the sentence accordingly; or it can backdate the sentence …” 
        
       
      
    89 Howie J considered that the latter approach was available even if the offender was not actually in custody on the date when the sentence is deemed to have commenced. His Honour then went on, at 369 [29], to state the reasons the latter approach was preferable, including that by backdating the sentence, the court made it obvious to the offender that there had been a reduction in the sentence for the period already in custody. His Honour observed that it also eliminated any argument as to whether a discount had in fact been given, even though the sentencing judge had stated that the period spent in custody had been taken into account. His Honour further observed that the practice of backdating the commencement of the sentence avoided questions of disparity arising, in cases where there was no real substance in that argument.  
     
      
    90 The Crown recognised that there is some uncertainty arising from his Honour’s sentencing remarks as to precisely what sentence he was imposing. As senior counsel pointed out, his Honour did not specify whether he regarded the head sentence as one of 21 years and 5 months, or whether he delayed the commencement of the sentence by 12 months (that is, by the period of 5 months the appellant had already been in custody, plus the period of 7 months before his Honour partially accumulated the murder offence on the existing drug offence for which the appellant was already serving a sentence).  
     
      
    91 If the head sentence was intended to be one of 21 years and 5 months, then the ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence was 73.5 per cent. If his Honour intended to delay the commencement of the sentence by 12 months, then the statutory ratio was 75.5 per cent. In this regard, the Crown also pointed out that the correct calculation of the length of time the appellant must spend in custody for the murder offence is 16 years 2 months, and not, as the appellant asserts, 16 years 9 months, as the period of 7 months is referable only to the drug offence. 
     
      
    92 In my opinion, the appellant has not established error in the trial judge’s sentencing process. Nor has he established that the question I presently have under consideration should give rise to a sense of grievance when regard is had to the sentence imposed upon the co-accused, and in particular, when regard is had to the non-parole period and the ratio that it bore to the co-accused’s total sentence, such as to call for appellate interference. In the first place, the trial judge stated that the appellant was entitled to have credited the first 5 months that he spent in custody. That is a permitted course and does not require, in the proper exercise of discretion, that the sentence be backdated to the commencement of the time in custody. Secondly, the desirable approach, as stated by Street CJ in R v McHugh and adopted in R v Newman; R v Simpson, is an approach that is appropriate where, as his Honour said in the passage cited above, the period of pre-sentence custody relates exclusively to the offences for which sentence is being passed. In this case, although his Honour does not specifically mention it in his Remarks on Sentence, the appellant was serving a 6 month period of imprisonment from 10 December 2003, so that the 5 months pre-sentence custody to which his Honour referred included the appellant being in custody for other offences.  
     
      
    93 In my opinion, having regard to the terms on which his Honour imposed the sentence and the fact he specifically stated that the appellant was entitled to have credit for the five months in question, I am of the opinion that the matter was taken into account. However, even if I am wrong, it has not been demonstrated that some other sentence is warranted in law: see the Criminal Appeal Act s 6(3).  
     
      
    94 In the circumstances, I consider that leave to appeal should be granted on the application for leave to appeal against sentence and the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    95 The orders that I propose, therefore, are: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed; 
       
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence allowed; 
       
       
      3. Appeal against sentence dismissed.  
       
      
    96 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Beazley JA and with her Honour's reasons. 
     
      
    97 LATHAM J: I agree with Beazley JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MASON P: I agree with Harrison J and the additional remarks of Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: I agree with the orders proposed by Harrison J and with his Honour’s reasons. It is true that these were serious offences and heavier sentences might well have been justified. Nevertheless, in all the circumstances and, in particular, having regard to the respondent’s rather unusual subjective case, it cannot be said that the discretion of either of the sentencing judges has miscarried. 
     
      
    3 HARRISON J: This is a Crown appeal. The principles governing appeals by the Crown were summarised by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at par [70]. These principles are well known and it is unnecessary for present purposes to recite them. 
     
      
    4 The Crown appeals pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against sentences imposed upon the respondent by his Honour Nicholson DCJ at the Parramatta District Court on 8 December 2006 and by his Honour Charteris DCJ at the Sydney District Court on 12 December 2006.Charges and sentences imposed below5 On 20 June 2006 the respondent pleaded not guilty to the charges listed below. He went to trial before his Honour Nicholson DCJ and the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all counts: - 
     
      
      Count 1 
      : Robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon (knife) on 11 June 2005; 
      
     
     
      
      Count 2 
      : Robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon (knife) on 12 June 2005; 
      
     
     
      
      Count 3 
      : Robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon (knife) with wounding on 13 June 2005; and 
      
     
     
      
      Count 4 
      : Robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon (knife) on 13 June 2005.  
       
      
    6 On 29 August 2006 the respondent pleaded not guilty to the charge listed below. He went to trial before his Honour Charteris DCJ. The jury returned a verdict of guilty.  
     
      
      Count 5 
      : Robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon (knife) on 17 June 2005. (This charge was originally ""Count 5"" on the arraignment indictment but was severed from the indictment by order of his Honour Nicholson DCJ). 
       
      
    7 The four charges of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon are offences against s 97 of the Crimes Act 1900 and each is punishable with a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years. The charge of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon with wounding is an offence against s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900 and is punishable with a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 25 years. The standard non-parole period for that offence is 7 years.Sentences 
     
      
    8 On each of Counts 1, 2 and 4 the respondent was sentenced on 8 December 2006 to a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 18 June 2005 and to expire on 17 June 2008 with a balance of term of 1 year to expire on 17 June 2009. His Honour Nicholson DCJ ordered that the sentences be served concurrently. On Count 3 the respondent was sentenced on the same day to a non-parole period of 4 years to date from 18 June 2006 and to expire on 17 June 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years to expire on 17 June 2012. (A reference to ""2011"" at paragraph 58 in the remarks on sentence of his Honour Nicholson DCJ would appear to be a typographical error).  
     
      
    9 On Count 5 the respondent was sentenced on 12 December 2006 to a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months to date from 18 September 2008 and to expire on 17 December 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months to expire on 17 June 2013. 
     
      
    10 The overall effective sentence imposed upon the respondent, taking into account all of these sentences, is 8 years imprisonment to commence on 18 June 2005 and to expire on 17 June 2013 with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months to commence on 18 June 2005 and to expire on 17 December 2010. 
     
      
    Factual background 
     
      
    11 Count 1: At about 8.35pm on Saturday 11 June 2005 the respondent waited at a bus stop on the eastern kerb of Great North Road, Abbotsford. He was wearing a black beanie pulled down to almost cover his eyes, a black coloured zip up jacket, black trousers and white sports shoes. About 15 minutes later the victim, Mr Sujendra Prasad, a bus driver, drove his bus to the stop and opened the door for the respondent to get on board. The respondent stepped onto the bus and immediately produced a 15 cm long knife from his pocket. Holding the knife at waist level the respondent said, ""I only want the money"". Mr Prasad handed the respondent the cash tray containing $103.60 and $20 from his pocket. The respondent then asked, ""Where is your wallet money?"" Mr Prasad then gave the respondent $60 and indicated that his wallet was empty. The respondent grabbed the money and ran away. 
     
      
    12 Count 2: At about 7.57pm on Sunday 12 June 2005 the victim, Mr Robert Baraclough, a bus driver, saw the respondent and another person waiting at a bus stop at Broughton Street, Canterbury. He stopped the bus and let them board. The respondent stepped onto the bus first, followed by the other person. The respondent said, ""I want your money and your wallet"". Mr Baraclough said, ""You can go and get fucked, you're not getting my wallet"". The respondent then took a knife from the side of his tracksuit trousers and waved it in the air. Mr Baraclough, fearing that he might be hurt, grabbed the respondent’s arm preventing him from using the knife. The respondent then put the knife back in his trousers, lifted up the cash tray and ran away. The person who was behind the respondent rang the police on his mobile phone. There was $100 in the cash tray. Mr Baraclough described the knife as a fishing knife about 15cm long. 
     
      
    13 Count 3: The victim, Mr Christopher Pasqual, a bus driver, was rostered to work on Route 465 on the Queen’s Birthday public holiday on 13 June 2005. At about 4.15pm he drove his bus along Tennyson Street, Mortlake and saw the respondent standing at a bus stop. The respondent was wearing sunglasses and a hat and carrying a bag with his left hand. Mr Pasqual stopped his bus and let the respondent get on board. The respondent stepped onto the bus and took out an 11.5cm long knife from his bag and said, ""Give me the money"". Mr Pasqual gave him the cash tray and said, ""Take it"". At that stage the respondent went closer to Mr Pasqual, who became fearful of what might happen and tried to push the respondent away from him. He swung the cash tray at the respondent, knocking down his sunglasses. The respondent lunged forward with his knife, wounding Mr Pasqual’s outer left forearm. Coins from the cash tray spilled onto the floor of the bus. The respondent attempted to collect his sunglasses from the floor saying, ""I'll kill you"". Mr Pasqual tried to kick the respondent but did not connect. The respondent left, running from the bus towards a rendezvous point. He left his sunglasses behind. The attempted robbery yielded nothing. 
     
      
    14 Mr Pasqual sustained a single stab injury to the ulnar aspect of his left forearm. There was evidence of a complete left ulnar nerve injury at the forearm level. He underwent microsurgery. In June 2006 he was assessed as having lost 40 per cent of his upper limb ulnar nerve function equating to 16 per cent upper limb dysfunction. The prognosis was that he would always have some degree of loss of dexterity in his left hand as a result of the injury. 
     
      
    15 Count 4: At about 4.26pm on Monday 13 June 2005, the victim, Mr John Zhang, a bus driver, saw the respondent and an elderly lady waiting at a bus stop on the eastern side of Great North Road, Abbotsford. When he stopped the bus the elderly lady boarded first followed by the respondent who was carrying a backpack. The respondent took out a knife about 15cm long from his pocket, pointed it at Mr Zhang and said, ""Give me all of your money"". Mr Zhang was shocked and did not know what to say. The respondent again said, ""Give me all of your money"". Mr Zhang then handed over the cash tray containing about $120. The respondent took hold of the cash tray, put it in his backpack and ran away. 
     
      
    16 Count 5: At about 4.45pm on 17 June 2005 the victim, Ms Theodoris Tserdanis, a young woman employed by the Waratah Florist at Dulwich Hill, was working alone when the respondent walked into her shop. He ordered half a dozen roses. When she had finished preparation of the flowers she handed them to him and asked for the price of $12. The respondent pulled out a knife with his left hand and said, ""Now I want you to give me all the money in the till"". There was some cash adjacent to the till which he took. The respondent told her to open the till. She started to take out the $50 and $20 bills and the respondent reached in and grabbed the $5 bills. When leaving the shop the respondent said, ""Call 000”. She shook her head, indicating that she was not going to do so. The respondent again said to her, ""Call 000”. 
     
      
    Ground of appeal 
     
      
    17 The Crown appeals on the single ground that the sentences imposed in all cases are manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    Crown submissions on appeal 
     
      
    18 With respect to the sentences imposed by his Honour Nicholson DCJ the Crown notes that they reflect concurrency in relation to the three unrelated s 97 offences (Counts 1,2 and 4) and partial accumulation of the unrelated s 98 offence (Count 3). The sentence imposed by his Honour Charteris DCJ is partially accumulated on the sentence imposed for the s 98 offence with the result that only three months imprisonment is solely referable to Count 3. In these circumstances, the Crown submits that the effective sentence for all counts does not reflect the total criminality of the five offences. 
     
      
    19 The Crown submitted that where there are multiple offences the Court needs to strike a balance between the principle of totality and ensuring that an effective punishment is imposed for each individual sentence: see R v Wheeler [2000] NSWCCA 34 at [35]. The imposition of wholly concurrent sentences for a series of offences creates the perception that there is little difference between the effective penalty for one or two offences and the effective penalty for six or seven offences: see R v Webster [2005] NSWCCA 110 at [42]. 
     
      
    20 The Crown submitted that the sentences of 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years for each of Counts 1,2 and 4 were inadequate. The Crown referred to the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. The Crown contended that a comparison between Henry and the present case highlighted the following three factors unfavourable to the respondent. First, the respondent was 40 years of age at the time of the offences and was therefore not a young offender. Secondly, it could not be said that the respondent had no or little criminal history having been convicted twice for armed robbery, among other things. Thirdly, the respondent did not plead guilty. 
     
      
    21 The Crown contended that these factors, when combined with the fact that there were three offences, which took place on three separate days, and involved three separate victims for which the respondent was given concurrent sentences, demonstrated that the sentences imposed were not only inadequate but manifestly so in their totality. 
     
      
    22 His Honour Nicholson DCJ referred to Henry in his remarks on sentence and, specifically, made the following comments at pars [48]–[50]: - 
     
      
       
        
        “[48] Indicia in this case does ( 
        sic 
        ) not compare favourably to the three of the eight criteria set out in  
        Henry's 
         case. Namely;  
         
         
        1. In  
        Henry's  
        case, young offender with little or no criminal history.  
         
         
        In this case the position is different on both scores;  
         
        iii. Limited degree of planning. 
         
         
        [49] Again, the planning here was carefully done and became, in fact, a modus operandi;  
         
         
        vii. Plea of guilty in  
        Henry's 
         case against the strong Crown case;  
         
         
        [50] In this case there was no plea of guilty"". 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour then proceeded to impose sentences for the s 97 offences and made the following remarks at par [52] under the heading Sentences concurrent and cumulative: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[52] In this case it is important that the assault with intent to rob plus wounding be recognised as the most serious of the offences with which I am dealing. That recognition is achieved by partly accumulating the sentence for that offence to the other three sentences. In respect of the three remaining offences of robbery the criminality associated with each is identical. The sentences for these three will be inflated to the degree that is necessary to take into account the question of totality of criminality as among those three. The question of totality as among the four is taken into account by the point at which accumulation commences."" 
        
       
      
    24 In the Crown's submission, the sentence of 4 years consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years plus 1 year balance of term did not adequately reflect ""the totality of criminality as among those three"". 
     
      
    25 The Crown submissions make reference to the fact, correctly in my opinion, that his Honour's remarks on sentence were ""very detailed"". This included, but was not limited to, his Honour's recitation of the circumstances of the offences. In addition, his Honour dealt specifically and in terms with matters relevantly calling for his consideration including objective criminality, aggravating features, the effect of each of the robberies upon the victims as disclosed generally by the facts and specifically from victim impact statements, as well as subjective matters referable to the respondent, including his significant addiction to drugs. Importantly, at par [41] of his remarks on sentence, his Honour made the following comments in relation to contrition: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""[41] There is nothing in the material before me suggesting any insight into or contrition for these offences. His case was that he was not the robber and had nothing to be contrite about or display insight into. It is certain from observing him that he is not contrite and feels no need to suggest he has any insight into anything related to these robberies."" 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour found that the respondent's ""rehabilitation prospects must be regarded as guarded”: see par [42]. His Honour set out in some considerable detail his reasons for forming this view. In doing so his Honour appears properly to have balanced both positive and negative considerations. 
     
      
    27 The Crown accepted that it was within the sentencing judges' discretion to conclude that sentences for similar matters should be dealt with concurrently. However, the Crown submitted, in that event, that the principle of totality should be taken into account in setting the individual sentences. In the respondent's case, according to this submission, that would mean that, having regard to the Henry guideline, the full term of the sentence should have been in excess of 5 years. The Crown supported this submission with references to R v Basha [2003] NSWCCA 36; (2003) 138 A Crim R 245 per Smart AJ at [97]–[100], R v Swadling [2004] NSWCCA 421 per Smart AJ at [69] and R v Cotter [2003] NSWCCA 273 per Hulme J. In particular, the Crown relied upon the remarks of Miles AJ (with whom Santow JA and James J agreed) in R v KM [2004] NSWCCA 65 at pars [55]–[56] as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""[55] … In particular, whilst the totality principle is familiar enough and applied commonly enough in favour of an offender in order to avoid an excessive or crushing punishment, it is not to be disregarded for the converse purpose of assessing whether the overall effect of the sentences is sufficient having regard to the usual principles of deterrence, rehabilitation and denunciation. 
         
         
        [56] In particular, when there is a series of offences, some committed on one victim, others committed on another victim, there is a special need to ensure that concurrency of sentence does not gloss over that feature, a point made by Hulme J in  
        Cotter 
        ."" 
        
       
      
    28 Having obviously determined that the sentences for the three s 97 offences should be served concurrently, his Honour said, ""The sentences for these three will be inflated"" to take into account the principle of ""totality as among those three"". However, the Crown argues that his Honour did not explain why he then chose the bottom of the Henry range as the starting point in circumstances where he had already indicated that the relevant indicia in the present case did not compare favourably to three of the eight criteria set out in Henry's case. 
     
      
    29 In relation to the sentence for Count 3 the Crown re-emphasised that the standard non-parole period for an offence under s 98 is 7 years imprisonment. Given that the respondent did not plead guilty, and that he had a previous record of criminal offences including armed robbery, the Crown submitted that it was difficult to see any justification for not imposing something close to the standard non-parole period. The Crown referred to the well-known remarks of this Court dealing with the operation of the standard non-parole period scheme in Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at par [122]. The Crown submitted that it was clear that it was the intention of the legislature that the standard non-parole period should be applied in cases such as the present. 
     
      
    30 After a detailed review of the manner in which his Honour dealt with this offence in his remarks on sentence (see, for example, pars [11], [12], [33] and [52]), the Crown referred to pars [24] and [26] where his Honour made the following comments: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""[24] In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence for the purpose of considering whether it reaches a mid range of seriousness I have had regard to it as though it stood alone. I paid no regard to its position in the sequence of offending conduct… 
         
         
        [26] Not without hesitation have I determined this offence falls below the mid range of seriousness. I do regard it as approaching a mid range…"" 
        
       
      
    31 In relation to Count 5, the Crown argued that the head sentence of 4 years and 9 months was arguably less than the respondent should have received after a jury trial. However the Crown did not argue that the head sentence on its own was manifestly inadequate. Rather, the Crown argued that the degree of accumulation of the sentences imposed by his Honour Nicholson DCJ led to an overall manifestly inadequate sentence having regard to the total criminality involved. 
     
      
    32 His Honour Charteris DCJ also provided thorough and detailed remarks on sentence. In light of the fact that the sentencing exercise that he was required to undertake came soon after the respondent’s earlier sentences were imposed, it is important to have regard to what his Honour said in this regard. Some of those remarks are as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""The other matters were dealt with by Judge Nicholson, apparently on 8 December 2006, less than a week ago. His Honour imposed concurrent sentences of four years with a non-parole period of three years in respect of three of the robberies. Those sentences were to date from the offender's date of arrest, 18 June 2005. In relation to the other armed robbery which involved the aggravation of a wounding, his Honour imposed a four year minimum period with a two year additional period. That term was to start one year after the concurrent offences for the other three armed robberies. The effect of his Honour's sentencing has resulted in the offender receiving a total sentence of seven years with a non-parole period of five years to date from the date of his arrest on this subject offence. 
         
        
        
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
              ***** 
              
             
            
           
          
         
         
        Taking into account all of those matters I consider a head sentence of four years and nine months is appropriate. I consider there should be some accumulation upon the sentences he is currently serving. I am persuaded that he should have the benefit of a special circumstances finding. 
        
       
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
              ***** 
              
             
            
           
          
         
         
        Taking into account the sentence I am imposing and his pre-existing sentences, he will be serving a head sentence of eight years, with a non-parole period of five years and six months, with a parole period of two years and six months."" 
        
       
      
    33 The Crown submitted that it was significant that the overall sentence did not include a non-parole period of 7 years, which is the standard non-parole period for the s 98 offence. The Crown contended that his Honour Nicholson DCJ had erred in determining that the offences with which he dealt were below the middle of the range and that his Honour Charteris DCJ also erred in only imposing an additional six months upon that existing non-parole period. In short, the Crown contended that the level of concurrency with the existing non-parole period was too high. 
     
      
    34 In R v Jones [2004] NSWCCA 432 Tobias JA said at [32]: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""[32] . . . even if categorised as part of a series of offences or one bout of criminality, the victim of the subject offence was not a victim of the other offences and, therefore, it was necessary for the total sentence to reflect that fact and be sufficient having regard to the usual principles of deterrence, rehabilitation and denunciation."" 
        
       
      
    35 However, his Honour said this at pages 8 and 9 of his remarks on sentence: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""I formed the view that this offence and the offences in the previous seven days were related to his addiction to heroin and his need to obtain money so as to purchase drugs. I think, having regard to the conditions imposed upon his parole in the sentences imposed in 2001, that those offences were also influenced by his need for illicit drugs. It is well established that drug addiction does not provide an offender with an excuse. It does not mitigate his penalty to any extent. It may impact upon considerations of rehabilitation and release. It explains his behaviour, it does not excuse it."" 
        
       
      
    Respondent’s submissions on appeal36 It was submitted by the respondent that, with respect to Counts 1, 2 and 4, it was appropriate for his Honour Nicholson DCJ to impose sentences of the same length in relation to each offence and that, in accordance with the principles in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610, to determine whether there should be concurrency or accumulation.37 The respondent also relied upon a passage from the judgment of Simpson J in R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at 67: - 
     
      
       
        
        ""I do not agree that for the sentencing judge to take into account, in considering questions of concurrence and accumulation, features that were common to the two conspiracy offences, denotes an invalid reasoning process. Whether or not to accumulate sentences imposed in relation to multiple offences is, in the end, an exercise of discretion to be made in accordance with established principle. Features common to two or more offences are all matters relevant to be taken into account (pointing towards concurrence) as are features indicating the disparate nature of the offences (pointing the other way)."" 
         
         
         
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
                
               ***** 
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
         
        ""As a result of the decision of the High Court in  
        Pearce 
         … the question of whether to accumulate sentences for multiple offences has taken on a new dimension. Following  
        Pearce 
        , a judge is required to fix ""an appropriate sentence"" for each offence, before considering questions of accumulation, concurrence or totality. I take this to mean that, except perhaps in cases of multiple offences committed as part of a single discrete, episode of criminality, the sentence for an individual offence is to reflect the criminality involved in the offence untainted by reference to the other offences for which that offender is to be sentenced"". 
        
       
      
    38 The respondent submitted that the offences before his Honour had many features in common and were committed as part of a discrete episode of criminality. It was therefore open to his Honour to determine that there should be a high degree of concurrency. Moreover, the respondent observed that it has long been recognised that the totality principle enables a judge who is sentencing an offender for a number of offences to mitigate what strict justice would otherwise indicate, and that sometimes the sentence imposed may even fail adequately to reflect the seriousness of the crimes: see Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 per McHugh J at 307-308 and Kirby J at 341. 
     
      
    39 The respondent submitted that it was well within his Honour’s discretion to determine that these three very similar offences, committed over a short period of time, should attract totally concurrent sentences. Moreover, the respondent submitted that, in circumstances where his Honour clearly intended to accumulate the sentence to be imposed for Count 3, his Honour was required, in accordance with the principle of totality, to modify the sentence to be imposed in respect of these counts. The respondent argued that the overall sentence imposed in respect of the four counts (a total sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years) was well within an appropriate sentencing range. 
     
      
    40 With respect to the s 98 offence, the respondent submitted that his Honour was entitled to find that it did not fall within the mid-range of seriousness for such offences. His Honour had the benefit of seeing the commission of the offence as recorded on a CCTV camera; in those circumstances he was well placed personally to assess the gravity of the offence. 
     
      
    41 Finally, the respondent submitted that his Honour Charteris DCJ was entitled to find that the offence with which he was dealing was part of a discrete period of criminality committed at the same time as the earlier offences. In those circumstances his Honour was required to look at the principal of totality in determining the amount of the sentence that should be concurrent, and the amount that should be cumulative. The respondent submitted that, in accordance with that principle, it was well within his Honour’s sentencing discretion to impose a sentence structured in the way that it was. 
     
      
    Consideration 
     
      
    42 The five offences were committed over a period of six days. Two of them were committed on the same day. There was then a gap of two days before the final offence was committed. The offences in counts 1 to 4 inclusive did have certain features in common, although count 3 is arguably quite different from the others for obvious reasons. Count 5 is different from the other four, again for obvious reasons. At one level it would be possible to view all five offences as part of a single, discrete episode of criminality. This submission, however, draws more upon a consideration of certain subjective factors relating to the respondent than upon an objective assessment of the acts said to constitute the offences. I do not think that it would be appropriate to sentence the respondent as if the five offences were all part of a single, discrete episode. 
     
      
    43 There is no doubt that the imposition of both longer sentences and non-parole periods, the calculation of different ratios between the non-parole periods and the balances of term, and a significant extension of the overall effective sentence and non-parole period by the adoption of a different approach to concurrency and accumulation, may well all have withstood scrutiny on a severity appeal. It is the essence of the imperfect exercise of discretion that a range – often a widely discrepant range – of permissible results may be produced.  
     
      
    44 In the present case, that prospect has been enlarged by the unusual, although by no means unique, fact that the sentences complained of are the result of two separate exercises of discretion. In sentencing the respondent on count 5 his Honour Charteris DCJ adverted specifically in his remarks on sentence to the sentences by then already imposed upon the respondent upon the other counts. His Honour dealt with the matter as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I have formed the view that there must be an accumulation to reflect the criminal behaviour demonstrated in this offence. It does not seem to me an appropriate case to make a sentence concurrent with the existing sentences. The offence is a very serious one indeed; it carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. There must be demonstrated, in accordance with the purposes of sentencing, a significant penalty so as to deter this offender and other like minded individuals from committing offences of this nature. I have not lost sight of the fact that there would have been an enormous shock occasioned to the victim by this offender's behaviour and it is in fact a very cowardly offence to select this young woman who was alone and vulnerable and confront her with a threat of violence by a knife. I have not lost sight of the fact, of course, that the offender was motivated by his need to address his drug addiction."" 
        
       
      
    45 The Crown does not complain that these remarks are either inaccurate or inappropriate. The Crown’s concern is that both alone and in combination the sentences fail to reflect an adequate degree of accumulation with the result that the sentences for counts 3 and 5 in particular do not in practical terms recognise the sentiment that those remarks convey. These concerns are clearly reflected in the diagram set out below. 46 There is also a concern that any attempt to justify the sentences on the basis that they fall within the Henry guidelines simply does not withstand scrutiny. For example, there was no plea of guilty, the offender was not young without a criminal history and there was a not inconsiderable, if ultimately ineffective, degree of planning, particularly with respect to the first four counts. There was no expression of remorse. However, his Honour Nicholson DCJ expressly disavowed the relevance of Henry to the present case as not comparing favourably. His Honour Charteris DCJ also referred to the guideline judgment in order to distinguish it rather than to justify any part of the sentence he imposed. 
     
      
    47 In my opinion, the key to an understanding of the sentences imposed upon the respondent is to be found by having regard to the importance of the position of the sentencing judge. I refer to this in more detail below. 
     
      
    48 In R v Tortell and Tsegay [2007] NSWCCA 313, after referring to what was said by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at par [70], I said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[52] In addition to these principles, I have had regard to the further restraint upon interference “given the strong resistance that exists against appellate ‘tinkering’ with sentences” identified in  
        Dinsdale v The Queen 
         (2000) 202 CLR 321 at par [62]. This modern reaffirmation of the special importance of the sentencing tribunal is undoubtedly traceable to a number of sources. They presumably include what was said by Sir Frederick Jordan in  
        R v Geddes 
         (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554 at 556 as follows: - 
         
         
          
           
          '. . . I think that a Court of Criminal Appeal should intervene if the sentence appears to it to be out of reasonable proportion to the circumstances of the crime, having regard to the facts proved in evidence at the trial, but before the Court is satisfied that such an absence of due proportion exists, it should make the fullest allowance for the consideration that the trial judge has had an advantage denied to it, namely, that he has seen the witnesses, and, therefore, that he has had an opportunity of forming impressions which no perusal of cold print can afford. Unless some error in principle, or some such unreasonable disproportion, appears, I think that the case is not made out for revision of the sentence.' 
           
          
         
         
        [53] Earlier in the same case his Honour made the following comments: - 
         
         
          
           
          'The function of the criminal law being the protection of the community from crime, the judge should impose such punishment as, having regard to all the proved circumstances of the particular case, seems at the same time, to accord with the general moral sense of the community in relation to such a crime committed in such circumstances, and to be likely to be a sufficient deterrent both to the prisoner and to others. When the facts are such as to incline the judge to leniency, the prisoner’s record may be a strong factor in inducing him to act, or not to act, upon this inclination. Considerations as broad as these are, however, of little or no value in any given case. It is obviously a class of problem in solving which it is easier to see when a wrong principle has been applied than to lay down rules for solving particular cases, and in which the only golden rule is that there is no golden rule.'  
          
         
         
        [54] As I have said on other occasions, uncontroversially, the question of what is, and what is not, a proper sentence in any particular case is a matter upon which minds will invariably differ. For example, in  
        R v Burns 
         [2007] NSWCCA 228, I expressed the following opinion at par [36]: -  
         
         
          
          '[36] There is often a fine line between those cases in which a sentencing judge can be shown to have failed properly to exercise a discretion reposed in her or him, having regard to the relevant legislative constraints and current judicial guidance, on the one hand, and those cases in which the discretion has patently been exercised in a way that balances and accommodates all the manifold competing circumstances and influences, on the other hand. Views on sentencing outcomes will almost always vary, depending significantly, although not exclusively, upon the perspective of the commentator. There seems little doubt that some appropriate sentence of full-time imprisonment imposed upon the present respondent could have withstood appellate scrutiny. However, for the purposes of this Court, that is not to the point. In my opinion the sentences imposed upon the respondent by his Honour were wholly appropriate. That is also not to the point. The issue is whether or not his Honour's sentencing discretion was relevantly infected by error in such a way that it resulted in the imposition of sentences that are manifestly inadequate. In my opinion, no relevant error has been demonstrated and the sentences imposed upon the respondent are not manifestly inadequate'."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    49 When he appeared for sentence the respondent was forty two years old. He was the older of two children. His mother, to whom he was close, died of cancer when he was aged twelve. His father dealt with the grief by immersing himself in work with two or three jobs at a time. The respondent felt an absence of being nurtured once his mother had passed on. The respondent never married although he had a girlfriend who overdosed on heroin. He was in a relationship for eight years but that ended in June 2005 because he was in custody in relation to the counts which are the subject of this appeal. The respondent is now apparently close to his father. 
     
      
    50 The respondent left school in year 10 at the age of sixteen. He struggled with his grades although he claims literacy. Until his mother died, he had performed reasonably well but lost motivation following her death. During his time in custody he has returned to education. He gained a forklift licence and completed a basic computer course. He has a certificate from TAFE attesting to an interest in, and completion of a portion of, a clothing production course during 2005. He has passed four units of that certificate. At the age of sixteen he commenced his working career as a storeman and packer. At seventeen he was a station assistant for the State Rail Authority. At nineteen he became a truckie's offsider. He then became a truck driver and followed that employment on and off for fifteen years. Since his mid-thirties he has not worked much, apart from some casual cleaning work and some work as a storeman. At the time of his arrest, his only income was from a Newstart allowance. 
     
      
    51 Each of the sentencing judges in this case was confronted with a relatively unusual exercise. The respondent was in his late twenties to early-thirties before he fell victim to a narcotic addiction that was indisputably at the heart of his crimes. That alone is sufficient to give pause for reflection upon how to approach the matter. There is also little doubt that the respondent was suffering from depression and had suffered from it since as early as his teens. That depression proved difficult to treat and there were several changes of anti-depressant medication. Despite all of this, the respondent acquired no relevant criminal history until 1999 at the age of 34. Finally, despite the seriousness of the charges and the undoubtedly distressing effect that these crimes had upon the respondent's immediate victims, the amounts that were stolen were small and relatively insignificant in the scheme of crimes of a like kind.52 Assessed in terms of the classical criteria of punishment, deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation and having regard to principles of concurrence, accumulation and totality, it is not in my view inevitable that a total sentence of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months should, in the particular circumstances relating to the offences committed by the present respondent, be characterised as erroneously lenient. In my opinion, the sentences imposed by their Honours, whether considered separately or together, demonstrate an unexceptional exercise of the sentencing discretion. It is insufficient in order to establish error simply to suggest scope for differences of informed opinion. Appellate intervention with the total sentence, or any of its constituents, would in my opinion amount to an unwarranted and inappropriate interference with what in each case has been a careful, thorough and transparent sentencing exercise. Even without the understandable restraints upon interference in the case of a Crown appeal, I would not have considered the sentences to be manifestly inadequate.Orders53 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

      14362/2007 Martin Dean LEWIS v Constable Brett SPENCER & Anor 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Martin Dean Lewis was charged and convicted with goods in custody, a contravention of s 527C(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. He was unrepresented during the substantive trial before the learned magistrate and at its conclusion was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  
     
      
    2 Mr Lewis appeals the conviction and sentence on a number of bases. Of the six grounds raised in the summons, the first is declaratory in effect and will not be dealt with separately. The grounds are: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The plaintiff appeals against the whole of the decision of the second defendant.  
        
       
       
       
        
        2. The second defendant erred in finding that the plaintiff’s appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee was not bona fide.  
        
       
       
       
        
        3. The second defendant erred in taking into account the convenience of prosecution witnesses in determining that the plaintiff’s appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee was not bona fide.  
        
       
       
       
        
        4. The plaintiff’s trial miscarried because the second defendant cross-examined the plaintiff during the prosecution case.  
        
       
       
       
        
        5. The plaintiff’s trial miscarried because the second defendant admitted hearsay material into evidence (the evidence of the first defendant of an out of court conversation with an unnamed BP service station manager).  
        
       
       
       
        
        6. The plaintiff’s trial miscarried because the second defendant did not advise the plaintiff that he could object to hearsay evidence.” 
        
       
      
    I will deal very briefly with the procedural history and necessary facts before setting out the legislation and dealing with these grounds (other than ground 1). It is also necessary to deal briefly with the jurisdiction of the Court.  
     
      
    Procedural History and Facts 
     
      
    3 The learned magistrate dealt with the matter on 13 June 2007. The manner in which the matter proceeded is the fundamental basis upon which the appeal is agitated. There is a need to deal with some very short background.  
     
      
    4 Mr Lewis applied for legal aid in relation to the matters before the learned magistrate and was refused legal aid (or the grant of legal aid was terminated) on 21 May 2007. When the matter came before the magistrate for hearing on 13 June 2007, Ms Siobhain Climo, solicitor, employed by the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales, appeared before the magistrate on behalf of Mr Lewis to inform the magistrate that Mr Lewis had been refused legal aid and that he was intending to appeal that refusal. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour unfortunately Mr Lewis has been refused legal aid. The reason for that is that he failed to attend an appointment and the reason for that is due to the illness of his father. I am seeking an adjournment today so that he can lodge an appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee. I am seeking an adjournment under s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act.” 
        
       
      
    5 The immediate response of the learned magistrate was: 
     
      
       
        
        “This has all got to be bona fide, that is what s 57 requires and if he just doesn’t turn up, he has not done what is really required of him. I am not going to grant an adjournment. The matter is going to proceed. You are ready to proceed I imagine sergeant?” 
        
       
      
    6 There was an exchange between the learned magistrate and Ms Climo in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: You have all the witnesses here. No the adjournment is refused … 
         
         
        MS CLIMO: Well your Honour I am happy to call some evidence in terms of the circumstances so that your Honour can be satisfied as to the genuineness of those circumstances if that warrants … 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Well you indicated his father is ill, does he have to stay at his father’s bedside 24 hours a day for the last month? 
         
         
        MS CLIMO: Well … 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Nothing stops him from attending an appointment. It is just completely unreasonable and unnecessary – the State has gone to a lot of trouble to get all their witnesses here and I just won’t allow it to be wasted. 
         
         
        MS CLIMO: If the matter could stand in the list and I will have a discussion with Mr Lewis? 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, certainly.” 
        
       
      
    The matter stood in the list. On its resumption the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
       
        
        “MS CLIMO: Thank you your Honour I have had a discussion with Mr Lewis, he has now submitted to me a notice of his appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee, so that application has been received. The grounds upon which, and I am renewing my application for an adjournment, the grounds upon which the application, the notice of appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee, has been made are certainly grounds in my submission that cannot be seen as frivolous or vexatious and that, in my experience of these appeals, this appeal and the grounds upon which it is made has a very high likelihood of succeeding at the Legal Aid Review Committee and I am asking your Honour to consider an adjournment so that process can be undertaken.  
        
       
       
       
        
        Your Honour is aware that s 57 outlines that he has that right to appeal and that if the appeal or the intention to appeal is bona fide and not frivolous or vexatious or otherwise intending to improperly hinder or improperly delay the conduct of the proceedings and that there are no special circumstances that prevent it from doing so, the court shall adjourn the proceedings.  
        
       
       
       
        
        In the document, Mr Lewis has submitted to me an outline of the grounds to do with the illness of his father and those grounds in my submission could not be viewed as frivolous or vexatious and I am asking that your Honour consider an adjournment. I have a large number of these Legal Aid Review Committee matters and there is a high likelihood of success for him at that Committee. Given that and given the serious nature of the matters which he faces today I would be asking for that adjournment.  
        
       
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, for what reason does his father’s illness prevent him from carrying out the required steps to … 
        
       
       
       
        
        MS CLIMO: I am not in a position. The Act actually prevents me from disclosing the grounds upon which the legal aid was refused. I am actually not in a position to go into any detail in relation to that. I have foreshadowed that it is an illness in relation to his father so that your Honour has some information upon which to base the decision surrounding whether or not the appeal is frivolous or vexatious but I am not in a position to be able to disclose the full details of what, in fact, has occurred with Mr Lewis’ grant of aid, that is a matter of confidentiality between ourselves and Mr Lewis but I can certainly indicate to your Honour that this illness in relation to his father is something that has been quite longstanding and his father has been in hospital in relation to it. That is as far as I can take the reasons for the refusal for the grant of aid.  
        
       
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. Thank you for that. Intrinsically he is entitled to go through the process of making an appeal and he may well succeed and it is your view that he will succeed and he may well succeed in the appeal. To that extent everything is normal. He says the reason why he did not secure legal aid in the first place is he did not attend when requested to enable legal aid to be secured. I am told he did not attend because of his father’s illness. I accept his father is ill and I am very sorry to hear that but you have not told me why that prevents you from taking the simple step of securing legal aid when you were invited to do so. Section 57 has a provision of bona fides and simply the State pours enormous resources into arranging witnesses to come today but then if the matter is adjourned to come on another time, to say nothing of the inconvenience to police themselves. They should not need to do it 2 or 3 or multiple times, they should only need to do it once. The requirement of bona fides in this case I do not find is met and the application for adjournment on the grounds requested is refused. The matter will proceed. Are you incidentally in a position to proceed in this sergeant? 
        
       
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Yes.  
        
       
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, well the matter must proceed and I will deal with another matter first.” 
        
       
      
    Legislation  
     
      
    7 It is necessary to set out s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1979, which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “57. Where it appears to a court or tribunal, on any information before it:  
         
          
          (a) that a party to any proceedings before the court or tribunal:  
           
            
            (i) has appealed, in accordance with section 56, to a Legal Aid Review Committee and that the appeal has not been determined, or  
             
            (ii) intends to appeal, in accordance with section 56, to a Legal Aid Review Committee and that such an appeal is competent,  
            
           
          (b) that the appeal or intention to appeal is bona fide and not frivolous or vexatious or otherwise intended to improperly hinder or improperly delay the conduct of the proceedings, and  
           
          (c) that there are no special circumstances that prevent it from doing so,  
           
          the court or tribunal shall adjourn the proceedings to such date on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    8 In terms relevant to the application of s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act, the first application for an adjournment made by Ms Climo relied on the provisions of s 57(a)(ii) and the second application relied on the provisions of s 57(a)(i).  
     
      
    9 As is clear from the extracted exchange and/or reasons of the learned magistrate, his Honour took the view that much inconvenience would be caused by an adjournment and it would be a waste of the “enormous resources” of arranging witnesses for an adjournment to occur and therefore the requirement of “bona fides” is not met.  
     
      
    Grounds 2 & 3: Lack of Bona Fides and Inconvenience of Witnesses are Not Relevant Factors 
     
      
    10 In construing any legislation it is necessary to discern, initially from the terms of the statute, the meaning that the legislature is taken to have intended any such provision to have. Generally and ordinarily the grammatical meaning will be the meaning of the provision but sometimes the context of the words, the consequences of a grammatical meaning and the purpose of the statute may require words to have something other than their grammatical meaning: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [78]. 
     
      
    11 It is often difficult, especially for judicial officers that are facing a long list, to step back from the pressures associated with case management and ascertain with precision the tests that are required in dealing with an issue such as that which was before his Honour. The provisions of s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act, properly construed, require a court or tribunal before which there are proceedings to adjourn those proceedings if there is an appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee or an intention by one or other of the parties to lodge such an appeal. Prima facie the existence of an appeal or an intention requires the adjournment. It is only in circumstances where the appeal or intention to appeal is not bona fide, not frivolous or vexatious or not otherwise intended “to improperly hinder or improperly delay” the conduct of the proceedings that the adjournment may not be granted. However it is the appeal or intention to appeal that must lack the bona fides or must otherwise be frivolous or vexatious or intended to hinder or delay the conduct of the proceedings improperly.  
     
      
    12 Section 57 has an obvious purpose and fits the overall purpose of the Legal Aid Commission Act.  
     
      
    13 It is a purpose complementary to the achievement of justice for persons who otherwise are unable to afford private legal representation. It ensures, so far as practicable, that persons without the means to be represented are not tried and convicted in the absence of representation, when there is a possibility that, after their application for legal aid has been dealt with, they will be properly represented. The representation of parties in proceedings aids not only the parties themselves, but the administration of justice itself.  
     
      
    14 Case management, simpliciter, is not a factor in the evaluation required by s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act.  
     
      
    15 On the material that was before his Honour, legal aid had been refused because Mr Lewis failed to appear at a nominated conference. He failed to appear at a nominated conference because his father was ill. The solicitor employed by the Legal Aid Commission expressed the view, with which no one cavilled, that it was likely the appeal to the Legal Aid Review Committee would be successful. Whether it was or will be successful does not determine the issue before the magistrate. The bona fides of the appeal is determined by an analysis of whether the appeal is being pursued for genuine purposes. In other words, the section requires the magistrate to determine whether the appeal is being lodged (or is intended to be lodged) for the purpose of causing the adjournment; not for the purpose of obtaining legal aid. In the case before the learned magistrate below, there is no suggestion that the appeal that was initially intended and was ultimately lodged was other than genuine and designed for the purpose of achieving the grant of legal aid and representation of Mr Lewis.  
     
      
    16 Further the issue with which the magistrate is concerned is not whether an adjournment will cause delay or whether the appeal will delay the proceedings. Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the use of the word “improperly” in its qualification of the hindering or delaying of the conduct of the proceedings. An adjournment for the purpose of obtaining legal aid and being represented is not an improper hindrance or delay. It may be different if there had been numerous applications and one could infer a lack of genuineness or a desire to avoid a hearing at all. But the desire to avoid (hinder or delay) the conduct of a proceeding until the person is represented, in circumstances where there is a genuine application for legal aid, is not an improper hindrance or delay in the conduct of the proceedings.  
     
      
    17 It is for those asserting that an adjournment should not occur to establish that one of the circumstances exists that would overturn the prima facie position that, an appeal having been lodged, the proceedings are adjourned: Fibre-Tek (Gold Coast) Pty Ltd v Sky Bennett [2006] NSWSC 1100 at [26] per Simpson J.  
     
      
    18 Even if the onus did not rest upon those opposing the adjournment, there is no material upon which the court below could have decided that the intention to appeal and, at a later stage the appeal, were not bona fide or that any delay occasioned by an adjournment would be improper. The terms of s 57 of the Legal Aid Commission Act require an adjournment, subject only to the evaluation to be made by the judicial officer to which reference has already been made. Therefore it is a consequence of the intended operation of the legislation that there will be an adjournment and the Act requires that witnesses re-attend and that proceedings be re-organised. The fact that witnesses will have to re-attend and that proceedings will have to be re-organised is not and cannot be sufficient reason to find that there is an improper hindrance or improper delay in the proceeding or that the appeal or intention to appeal is not bona fide.  
     
      
    19 Further, the learned magistrate confused his attitude to the merits of the appeal and the reason that legal aid was initially refused with the bona fides and/or arguability of the appeal. The Legal Aid Review Committee may or may not have the same attitude as the learned magistrate. On the material before the learned magistrate, whatever his view of whether Mr Lewis ought to have attended the interview, there was an appeal, it was lodged for the purpose of obtaining legal aid and the appeal was not unreasonable or vexatious, but, to the contrary, likely to succeed. The fact, if it be the fact, that Mr Lewis should have attended the conference and obtain legal aid does not affect the bona fides of the appeal. Indeed, even an unreasonable act that caused the initial refusal or termination of legal aid may not, without more, be conclusive or relevant to the bona fides of an appeal.  
     
      
    Ground 5 & 6: The Admission of Hearsay 
     
      
    20 The magistrate admitted evidence from a witness, a police officer, that the witness had interviewed a member of staff at the BP Service Station from which Mr Lewis had said he had purchased the sunglasses. The police officer gave evidence that the member of staff had told him that the records of the establishment did not disclose that a pair of sunglasses had been sold on the day in question. If that evidence were given by the police officer for the purpose of proving the truth of the statement, namely, that no such sunglasses were purchased from that store on the day in question, it was inadmissible. It is evidence from the police officer of a representation made to him of the contents of the records of the shop. No exception to the rules on the admission of hearsay evidence would cover such a circumstance.  
     
      
    21 However, the offence under s 527C of the Crimes Act is an offence relating to a person having in his or her custody goods that “may be reasonably suspected of being stolen”. The reasonable suspicion is a reasonable suspicion of the magistrate at the time of hearing: Ex Parte Patmoy; Re Jack [1944] 44 SR (NSW) 351. The only basis upon which the hearsay representation by the shop staff member to the police officer could be relevant would be if it were the reasonable suspicion of the police officer at the time of arrest that was the relevant test. One of the means by which one could reasonably suspect that the sunglasses were stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained would be that the place from which the accused alleges it was purchased had not sold any sunglasses (or those sunglasses) on the day in question. However the evidence of the police officer does not prove that fact: see Manley v Tucs (1985) 40 SASR 1 at 12-13; Shaaban Bin Hussein v Chong Fook Cam [1970] AC 942 at 949; Williams v Keelty [2001] FCA 1301; (2001) 111 FCR 175 at [176], [177]; Morris v Russell (1990) 100 FLR 386 (ACT Supreme Court).  
     
      
    22 In Parker v Todhunter (1987) 89 FLR 294 at 295, Yeldham J examined s 527C and the nature of “reasonable suspicion” and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        Cleary v Hammond  
        [1976] 1 NSWLR 111 Lee J was concerned with s 40 of the  
        Summary Offences Act 1970 
        . That, as I have said, is in precisely the same terms as s 527 
        C 
         of the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
         which replaced it. After a careful examination of the history of the legislation, relating back as it did to the  
        Police Offences Act 1901 (NSW) 
        , and to the authorities upon the section as it stood from time to time, particularly  
        Ex parte Patmoy; Re Jack 
         (1944) 44 SR (NSW) 351 and  
        Purdon v Dittmar 
         [1972] 1 NSWLR 94, his Honour (at 118) concluded:  
         
         
         
          
          ‘In the result then, it appears to me that s 40, in referring to a thing which “may be reasonably suspected of being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained ...” is referring to a conclusion arrived at objectively by a magistrate when all the evidence pointing to the thing being stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained is before him. It must be proved that, on the date charged, the facts bring the person charged within the particular category s 40(1)(a)-(d) charged against him, and then it must be proved that it is open on all the evidence to conclude the goods “may be reasonably suspected of being stolen ...” The fact that the whole of the evidence relied on at the hearing as showing that the goods “may be reasonably suspected of being stolen ...” is not available to the police at the time they take possession of the goods (as in this case) or at the time of arrest or charge in no way affects the admissibility of evidence obtained thereafter, if that evidence in fact tends to show that the goods “may be reasonably suspected of being stolen ...”.’ ” 
          
         
        
       
      
    23 In this case, the learned magistrate may have suspected, reasonably, that the goods were stolen or unlawfully obtained, if the magistrate were able to consider evidence that the goods were not purchased from the store nominated. But the police officer’s evidence was not evidence of that fact. It was “evidence” of a representation by a staff member of the contents of records, i.e., evidence (the police officer’s) of a representation (the staff member’s) of a representation (the contents of the record). The staff member’s representation may be sufficient to give rise in the mind of the learned magistrate of the non-purchase from the store. While that may not prove that the goods were stolen, it may be sufficient to found, when added to other material, a reasonable suspicion. But the material before the learned magistrate does not go that far.  
     
      
    24 As I have come to the conclusion that all of the proceeding beyond the adjournment application was inappropriate and that orders should be made reflecting that view, it is unnecessary to decide this issue finally.  
     
      
    Ground 4: Questioning of the Plaintiff by the Magistrate 
     
      
    25 Senior Counsel who appeared for Mr Lewis submits that the magistrate was in error in “cross-examining” Mr Lewis during the course of the prosecution case. The circumstances were that Mr Lewis, having been denied legal representation and an adjournment to obtain legal representation, presented his own case. The prosecutor called the informant police officer, Constable Spencer, who gave evidence in chief. The plaintiff commenced cross-examination with a question that was lengthy and was subject to objection. The learned magistrate allowed the objection and asked Mr Lewis if he had any other questions. Mr Lewis responded that he could not remember everything. At that point his Honour questioned the plaintiff at some length. Mr Lewis was at the bar table, he was not in the witness box. If he had decided to give evidence, no doubt the prosecutor would have had the opportunity to cross-examine. The cross-examination (or questioning) by the magistrate of Mr Lewis was directed to the obtaining of admissions or what might be used as admissions. The magistrate neither warned Mr Lewis nor advised him that he could refuse to answer the questions. Mr Lewis answered the questions.  
     
      
    26 There is sometimes a very fine line between the clarification of the submissions or position of a party who is unrepresented on the one hand and inappropriate questioning by a judicial officer as to the facts asserted in that person’s case on the other.  
     
      
    27 Even if the magistrate were entitled to question in the manner that he did, such questioning could occur only at the time that Mr Lewis’ case was being presented to the Court. It was not evidence in the proceedings. It was not given on oath. To the extent that it was an admission, unless the magistrate had warned or advised the party that he was entitled not to answer, the party would be entitled to assume (rightly) that refusing to answer a question from a judicial officer was a serious matter. Any statement made by the party could not have been, in any real sense, voluntary. Moreover, the timing of the questioning was during the cross-examination of a prosecution witness.  
     
      
    28 It was inappropriate for the judicial officer to question the party in this manner, on these facts, in the presence of the witness, and at a time when the prosecution had not concluded its case.  
     
      
    Jurisdiction of the Court 
     
      
    29 Neither party addressed on the jurisdiction of the Court. It was assumed by both parties that there existed a right of appeal. A person convicted of an offence has a right of appeal “on a ground that involves a question of law alone” by virtue of s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Such a question would not seem to include any questions raised by the grounds in the summons. Each of those grounds requires some assessment of the factual circumstances that gave rise to the exercise by the learned magistrate and each issue required a factual assessment by the magistrate: see Krishna v DPP (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 318 at [2], [44]-[50].  
     
      
    30 In those circumstances, leave to appeal is necessary: s 53(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. No party sought or opposed leave. It is manifest that leave is appropriate.  
     
      
    31 Further, given grounds raised and these reasons it would seem certiorari, or orders in the nature thereof, would be available at least in relation to Grounds 2 and 3 which are error in taking into account irrelevant considerations and probably jurisdictional errors in asking the wrong question and/or applying the wrong test: see Public Service Association v Federated Clerks Union (1991) 173 CLR 132.  
     
      
    32 Here there was no evidence establishing a lack of bona fides, nor any basis upon which the duty of the Local Court to adjourn could be displaced. In those circumstances, this Court has jurisdiction to make the orders. It is inappropriate to discuss this issue further because no party has challenged the capacity of the Court so to do or raised any problem associated with such orders.  
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    33 On 24 October 2007 I made orders the effect of which was to quash the decision refusing to adjourn the proceedings, to quash the conviction and sentence that thereafter followed and to remit to the Local Court for redetermination the charges that are before the Local Court without reference to the exchange between the learned magistrate and Mr Lewis. The foregoing reasons are the reasons for the orders already made, which I now relevantly repeat:  
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      2. Time to file appeal be extended to 27 August 2007, which was the date of the filing. 
       
       
      3. The decision and order of the learned Magistrate his Honour James Garbett LCM refusing to adjourn the prosecution of Martin Dean Lewis made on or about 13 June 2007 be quashed. 
       
       
      4. The conviction and sentence of the aforesaid Martin Dean Lewis thereafter imposed be quashed and set aside. 
       
       
      5. The matter be remitted to the Local Court for redetermination without reference to the exchange between the learned Magistrate and the accused made in transcript. 
       
       
      6. Any other issue of evidence is a matter for the Magistrate then hearing the matter.

    CRIMINAL LAW - Sentence - Customs Act 1901 (Cth) - Second serious drug offence - no question of principleThe applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of conspiracy to import a trafficable quantity of cocaine contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). He had previously been convicted of the offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a trafficable quantity of the same drug contrary to s 233B(1)(d) and had been sentenced for that offence to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months. Accordingly s 235(1)(c) increased the maximum period of imprisonment for the current offence from 25 years to life. The applicant was the principal in the conspiracy, his co-conspirators being characterised as ""errand boys"". The conspiracy, which was open ended and ongoing at the time of his arrest, and had already lasted for 12 months, had involved the importation of 601.6 grams of the pure substance with a street value of $240,000. The applicant was on parole for the previous drug offence when the conspiracy began and for a further 4 months. The Judge adopted as his notional starting point a sentence of 17.5 years after allowing a discount of 20 per cent for the plea of guilty. The applicant was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for this offence with a non-parole period of 8 years 9 months. The co-conspirators had been sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years 9 months and 6 years 11 months respectively with appropriate non-parole periods and the Court of Criminal Appeal had refused to intervene. Held: The sentence should not be disturbed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY AJA: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from sentences imposed by Nield DCJ on 27 January 2006. He pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to import not less than the trafficable quantity of cocaine contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), this being the range between 2 grams and 2 kilograms. He also pleaded guilty to charges of cultivating 6 cannabis plants and supplying 4.519 kilograms of cannabis leaf contrary to sections 23(1) and 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). He asked that an offence of goods in custody relating to $3,500 in cash be taken into account on his s 25(1) offence.  
     
      
    2 The maximum penalty for the Customs Act offence is normally 25 years and a fine or both. However in 2001 the applicant had been sentenced to 3 years imprisonment for being knowingly concerned in the importation of cocaine equivalent to 250grams of the pure substance contrary to s 235(1)(d) of the Act. Accordingly s 235(1)(c) increased the maximum penalty for the applicant's Customs Act offence to life imprisonment and a fine or both. The sentencing Judge imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the  
        Customs Act  
        offence - 14 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years 9 months to date from 28 November 2003 when the applicant was arrested 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
        offence of supplying 4.519 kilograms of cannabis leaf - 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 28 November 2010, one year after the expiration of the non-parole period for the first sentence. The non-parole period was concurrent for 2 years and culmulative for one year 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         offence of cultivating cannabis plants - 1 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 months to commence on 28 November 2003 which was fully concurrent with the first sentence.  
        
       
      
    3 The sentencing Judge said that the applicant's pleas of guilty had a considerable utilitarian value to the State, and that he would allow a discount of 20 per cent. He said that his notional starting point for the conspiracy offence was 17.5 years and for the supply cannabis leaf offence was 5 years which were both discounted for his pleas of guilty. He also took into account in favour of the prisoner his assistance to the police following his arrest. The prisoner admitted his participation in the conspiracy, identified his co-conspirators, and described their roles. The Judge said the police were already aware of these matters, and this reduced the value of his assistance. The sentencing Judge did not identify the discount he applied, which can only have been taken into account in fixing the starting point of 17 years 6 months. However it is well established that his Honour was not bound to identify this discount: R v Thompson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, 419.  
     
      
    4 The conspiracy, which was open-ended and ongoing at the time of the applicant's arrest, had already involved 7 importations of 601.6 grams of pure cocaine in a bulk of 1613.7 grams with a street value of $240,000. Importation was from Chile through the post in 139 envelopes. They were intercepted while under the control of Australia Post. The applicant, as the principal in the conspiracy, was aware of the quantities involved, and their street value.  
     
      
    5 The sentencing Judge found that the applicant was the principal in the conspiracy offence who supplied the funds used to acquire the cocaine in Chile, and to lease the various post office boxes to which the letters were addressed. He found that the applicant's motive for entering into the conspiracy was financial gain from the resale of the cocaine at a considerable profit. The applicant was also the principal in the supply cannabis offence which related to cannabis having a street value of $90,000.  
     
      
    6 Aggravating features of considerable seriousness were established. The applicant had been sentenced on 8 February 2001 to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months to expire on 15 June 2001 and a recognisance release period of 1 year and 9 months to expire on 14 March 2003. He was released subject to this recognisance on 14 June 2001 but entered into the conspiracy in November 2002 within the recognisance period. Serious re-offending while on parole or conditional liberty is a materially aggravating factor.  
     
      
    7 The other aggravating factor was the earlier offence under s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act, involving a trafficable quantity of cocaine, which increased the maximum period of imprisonment for that offence from 25 years to life. Counsel for the applicant contended that the Judge's starting points of 17 years 6 months for the conspiracy offence and 5 years for the supply cannabis leaf offence were far too high, that they evidenced a failure to allow any appreciable discount for assistance to the authorities, that the sentences infringed the totality principle and that the much lower sentences imposed on the applicant's co-conspirators by the same Judge established a breach of the parity principle. 
     
      
    8 In sentencing the co-conspirator Teehan the Judge adopted as the starting point on the conspiracy charge a sentence of 13 years 6 months and on the supply cannabis charge a sentence of 3 years. He said that the starting point for the co-conspirator Viera was 12 years 6 months.  
     
      
    9 In the course of his remarks on sentence the Judge reviewed the relevant objective and subjective features as they applied to each of the conspirators. He held that the co-conspirators were ""errand boys"". Teehan had been in the conspiracy from the beginning but Viera only became involved on 17 October 2003. Teehan did not have a criminal record, and although Viera did, and was on conditional liberty at the time, his record was not for drug related offences.  
     
      
    10 Teehan was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years 9 months on the conspiracy charge with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months from 28 November 2003 and to imprisonment for 2 years 4 months on the supply cannabis leaf charge with a non-parole period of 1 year 9months, 1 year of which was concurrent with the non-parole period for the conspiracy offence.  
     
      
    11 Viera was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years and 11 months on the conspiracy charge with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. On 12 December 2006 this Court dismissed appeals by Teehan and Viera against these sentences.  
     
      
    12 The applicant challenged the Judge's findings as to the roles of the conspirators, and in particular his finding that the applicant was the principal in the conspiracy and supply cannabis leaf transactions and intended to act as a wholesaler of the drugs. These findings were well open on the evidence and cannot be disturbed.  
     
      
    13 The fact that the applicant was the principal who initiated and carried on the conspiracy while on a recognisance, that he had a prior serious drug conviction, and was liable to a higher maximum penalty demonstrate that a parity argument based on the sentences imposed on Teehan is not available, and the comparison with Viera is even less promising.  
     
      
    14 Counsel for the applicant relied on statistics from the Judicial Commission in relation to the conspiracy offence. Although they post dated the repeal of s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) on 19 December 2002 with immediate effect we have no information about the cases where the higher sentences were imposed. These statistics do not justify interference with these sentences.  
     
      
    15 The sentencing Judge refused to take into account in mitigation the fact that the applicant was on protective custody. The applicant relied on hearsay evidence by his mother who lived in New Zealand that she was told in the course of telephone conversations (AB 21-2) that at some stage his status in the prison system changed and he was placed on special protection and lost all his work rights. The applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings and the Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… the evidence is silent as to whether the offender is on protective custody in prison, and, if he is, as to the reason for it, the consequence of it and likely duration of it. Accordingly it seems to me that I cannot take this submission into account."" 
        
       
      
    16 The hearsay evidence of the applicant's mother does not establish error by the sentencing Judge in this passage.  
     
      
    17 No error of fact or of principle has been shown, and in my judgment the sentence cannot be characterised as manifestly excessive. The higher sentences imposed on the applicant compared with those imposed on Teehan are justified by his greater criminality and the differences in their subjective features. The applicant has failed to establish any principled basis for this Court to interfere with his sentences. I would therefore propose that the following orders be made: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          1. Leave to appeal granted. 
           
            
           
          2. Appeal dismissed. 
          
         
        
       
      
    18 HOEBEN J: I agree with Handley AJA and the orders he proposes. 
     
      
    19 SMART AJ: I agree with Handley AJA.20 The total of pure cocaine involved was 601.06 grams which is towards the lower end of the trafficable quantity range. The sentence of 14 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years 9 months for the offence of conspiracy to import not less than the trafficable quantity of cocaine in respect of the quantity in question is justified because of these factors: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) On seven occasions between 16 June 2003 and 7 December 2003 mail, being 139 envelopes/postcards in total, containing cocaine was intercepted. All mail was addressed to Post Office Boxes using fictitious addresses and posted from Chile. These importations were part of the conspiracy. 
         
         
        (b) The applicant arranged for a co-offender to go to Chile to ascertain why the cocaine supply was not arriving in Australia as expected. The conspiracy was ongoing. 
         
         
        (c) The applicant had previously been sentenced in 2001 for the serious drug offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of cocaine equivalent to 250 grams of pure cocaine to 3 years imprisonment.. This increased the maximum penalty from 25 years to life imprisonment.

      SENTENCE  
       
       
      1. I am sentencing Ryman Farag for six crimes. In addition, when I sentence him for one of those crimes he has asked me to take into account three other crimes which he has committed.  
       
       
      2. The six crimes are all drug offences. Five of them are the offence of supplying a prohibited drug. In each case the drug was heroin. On each occasion the offence was committed against s 25(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 
      .  
      Each of those offences carries a maximum of fifteen years imprisonment.  
       
       
      3. The sixth offence was an offence against s 25A of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
      .  
      It carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment.  
       
       
      4. When I sentence him for that sixth offence, which is called ongoing supply of a prohibited drug, the drug in that case also being heroin, I take into account in that sentence the three additional crimes which he has asked me to consider. Each of those is also a drug offence. Two of them are for drug supply, one of them a supply of cannabis the other a supply of heroin. Both of those are against s 25(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.  
      The third is for possessing a prohibited drug, once again that drug was heroin, and the offence is committed against s 10 of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
      . 
       
       
       HIS HONOUR: I am just going to suspend my remarks on sentence now to explain to Mr Farag, which I normally do before sentencing someone. Mr Farag, I’m going to sentence you shortly. What I do first, as Mr Ainsworth has probably explained, is give my remarks on sentence. They are my reasons, and you will hear me refer to documents and things which you have already heard referred to in court and you will also hear me refer to your brother’s evidence. And the reason that judges do that is so that everybody including you and your family and any members of the public know the reasons why I am sentencing you. That’s why I go through this process, do you understand, before I actually deliver the sentence? 
       
       
      OFFENDER: Yes I do, your Honour. 
       
       
      5. Each of the six principal offences arose out of an undercover operation. Police had focussed their attention on the activities of persons involved in the supply of heroin in Campbelltown and Casula. They focused on Mr Farag as one of their suspects. Between 21 April 2006 and 15 June 2006 undercover police officers transacted the purchase of heroin from him on eight occasions. Five of those occasions formed the basis of the five charges of supplying heroin. Three of those occasions were grouped together and formed the basis of the charge of ongoing supply of heroin against s 25A. The transactions occurred in public car parks, mostly at Hungry Jack’s restaurant in Campbelltown and on two occasions in the car park of McDonalds restaurant in Casula. 
       
       
      6. In respect of the five supply offences, the respective dates, amounts and values of heroin supplied were these: 21 April 2006 0.06 grams $100, 26 April 2006 0.08 grams $100, 27 April 2006 0.18 grams $200, 16 May 2006 0.76 grams $700, 24 May 2006 0.45 grams $700.  
       
       
      7. The dates, amounts and cost or purchase price of the heroin supplied on the three occasions forming the basis of the ongoing supply charge were these: the dates ranged between 1 June and 16 June 2006 and the amounts were 1.93 grams $2400, 3.28 grams $5000 and 6.93 grams $9000. This provides the basic account of the crimes for which I am sentencing Mr Farag.  
       
       
      8. A number of things need to be said first about how serious these offences were. So far as supply of heroin is concerned I regard the first three supply offences involving prices of $100 and $200 as relatively small transactions. So far as the last two of the supply transactions for $700 are concerned I regard them as a little more serious than the first three. So far as the ongoing supply of a prohibited drug is concerned I regard them as fairly serious offences. They are nowhere the top of the range given that heroin can be sold for very significant sums of money, nevertheless they are well above transactions involving hundreds of dollars. 
       
       
      9. Still looking at the question of how serious these offences were I also take into account that they were more serious because they were committed by Mr Farag when he was on bail. He had been arrested for the offences which are on the Form 1. All of those offences were committed in 2005. He had been bailed either by the police or by a court after being arrested for those offences. In other words the justice system had agreed to allow him to go back in to the community at liberty. He abused that liberty afforded to him by engaging in the sale of heroin which amounts to the offences that I am sentencing him for now.  
       
       
      10. The next thing which needs to be said about the seriousness of these offences is that they were committed in disregard for the public safety. I do make some small allowance for the fact that they were all transactions involving undercover police so that the drugs themselves never went into the community. Nevertheless Mr Farag was prepared to make available to a relative stranger small to reasonably significant amounts of a very dangerous drug without any evidence of knowing whether the drug was to be used by that person, itself a dangerous activity, or so far as the large amounts were concerned more likely provided further within the community. He had a complete disregard for the impact which his activities might have had on other persons within the community.  
       
       
      11. The final thing which needs to be said about the objective seriousness of these offences is that they were committed by a drug addict. The authorities have made it clear that that of itself does not amount to a mitigating factor. The fact that crimes like this are committed by drug addicts, in other words, does not like other factors such as a plea of guilty or assistance to authorities, result automatically in a discount in the sentence. What it does mean, however, and in this regard I accept the submission of Mr Ainsworth who appears for Mr Farag, is that it reflects upon the objective seriousness of the activity which comprises the crimes. As Mr Ainsworth said, his client was heavily addicted himself to heroin. He was driven by his addiction to make the sales. That does not excuse his activity but it does explain it and it should be regarded not as seriously as transactions by a non-addicted person who undertakes the exercise in a calm manner as a business enterprise. The fact that he was addicted reflects itself in the impulsivity of the offending behaviour as well as his own judgment in being able to assess the seriousness of his own activity. They are the objective factors which form the basis of my approach to this sentence. 
       
       
      12. I turn now to factors which are personal to Mr Farag. The first source of that information is a pre-sentence report dated 13 June 2007. It records that he had been using illegal drugs since the age of fourteen and by the age of seventeen he had started to use heroin and was addicted to a $600 a day habit by the time he turned eighteen. It continued for some five years. By the age of twenty-two he resorted to engaging in criminal activity to support his habit. Mr Farag completed school to year ten but after entering the workforce decided to complete his higher school certificate, which he did successfully. He has enrolled in a TAFE course in information processing and is eighty per cent of the way through that course.  
       
       
      13. Very significantly the pre-sentence report indicates that he reported abstinence from illegal substance use since his arrest. He was arrested on 15 June 2006. He has undertaken urinalysis with his general practitioner on fifteen occasions between 23 November 06 and 25 May 07 with no illegal drugs detected. He has also engaged in some drug counselling for some months. 
       
       
      14. The other source of information about his personal circumstances came from his brother, Mr Tamer Farag, who was called by Mr Ainsworth. Mr Farag is a thirty-two year old accountant who pointed out that his family became very concerned about his brother’s drug usage. Many times his family found that they had to look for their brother, Ryman Farag, because he lost contact as a result of his becoming involved in his drug use. On one occasion he disappeared for some six months and it was not until they contacted the Police and Corrective Services that they tracked him down in gaol. They then undertook to back him 100 per cent in his rehabilitation. 
       
       
      15. The offender was bailed on 16 November 2006 on strict conditions to go out only in the company of his brother or his parents. He remained on bail for almost a year until 3 October 2007. His brother gave evidence about the offender’s rehabilitation and urinalysis which was paid for by the family. His brother was convinced that the offender was now no longer using drugs. He also saw a significant change in his brother’s attitude and behaviour. He has remained away from the friends who were involved in the drug culture. His relationship with their father has much improved. Both he and his sister, also a qualified accountant, are actively considering offering him employment with their respective companies. They are each in positions where they may well be able to bring that about. On his release they made it clear that the offender will live either with Mr Tamer Farag or with their parents. He confirmed his brother’s interest in possibly undergoing an accountancy course after he finished his course on information processing. 
       
       
      16. Another factor which is relevant in these proceedings is exhibit C. I have read exhibit C. It has been the subject of submissions and I will give it a specific quantified rate by way of discount when I come to specifying the sentences which I have in mind for Mr Farag. I accept Mr Ainsworth’s submissions about the effect of what is contained in exhibit C being real and the consequences which that behaviour was attended by when Mr Farag was engaged in it. I will also give some consideration to the future consequences of that behaviour. 
       
       
      17. I have taken into account a reference by Mr Ryan Porter dated 28 August 2007. He has known the offender for most of his life. Since Mr Farag’s release from custody Mr Porter noticed a change both physically and mentally, he appeared to be much healthier both physically and mentally. I have also read the encouraging report from Lorraine Pitts at the South West Sydney Area Health Service.  
       
       
      18. This evidence points to a number of factors favourable to Mr Farag which I now turn to to list before sentencing him. One factor, which I have not mentioned, is that Mr Farag pleaded guilty at his committal on 21 March 2007 which Mr Murray, who appears for the prosecution in this case, agreed was the earliest opportunity. The second personal factor is that Mr Farag is a relatively young man who was born on 19 February 1983 so that he is still aged twenty-four. The third factor is that he has clearly I find undertaken very serious efforts at his own rehabilitation. I accept the findings about his urinalysis and I accept his brother’s evidence. His prospects of future continuing rehabilitation I regard as good. It is difficult to predict the outcome of rehabilitation for anyone who is addicted, or has been, to this particular drug, but Mr Farag’s past efforts point to good prospects for his eventual complete rehabilitation. 
       
       
      19. The next factor that I refer to, which is also relevant to his future, is his family support. Mr Farag is backed by a very strong family who have supported him emotionally and financially and so far as accommodation is concerned as well. They are clearly behind him. This also includes the active consideration of employment. This must improve his prospects of rehabilitation. Another factor which contributes to his rehabilitation is Mr Farag’s active engagement in his own advancement by way of education. I have already mentioned exhibit C which I take into account. In regard to exhibit C I also accept the submission made by Mr Ainsworth concerning the frankness of the information provided by Mr Farag and the detail about his own activities.  
       
       
      20. I turn now to consider the sentence which I will impose. I have taken into account the submissions of both Mr Ainsworth and Mr Murray and the statistics produced by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. It is convenient to turn first to the appropriate sentence for the ongoing supply of heroin. It will become apparent, in my reasoning that I am about to explain, the discounts and factors which I take into account at arriving at my final figures. As I said I regard the offence of ongoing supply against s 25A in this case as reasonably significant. It is nowhere near the top of the range but it involves sums accumulating to $16,000 over a period of a few weeks and significantly was committed by Mr Farag whilst he was on bail. I would regard a starting figure for that offence as being seven years imprisonment, however there are two important discounting factors to take into account at this stage.  
       
       
      21. As I said Mr Farag has pleaded guilty early, indeed at the earliest opportunity. There is also the material in exhibit C. These are two factors to which the criminal law attaches much significance. Combined, and genuine as they are in this case, I propose to allow a discount of fifty per cent. I therefore regard the appropriate sentence after the discount as some three-and-a-half years. At this stage I take into account two other factors. The first is Mr Farag’s youth and the second is that in serving his custody there is a distinct possibility that the educational facilities available to him may be limited from time to time. I therefore propose to reduce the sentence a little further to reach a final sentence for the s 25A offence of two-and-a-half years. 
       
       
      22. I now turn to the question of the non-parole period. Mr Ainsworth submitted that there should be an adjustment from the normal ratio of three-quarters to a quarter, that is three-quarters of any sentence is served in custody without parole and one-quarter on parole. He submitted that there should be an adjustment so that less time is served in custody. Mr Murray did not oppose that submission. I regard the submission as soundly based. In this regard Mr Farag’s demonstrated rehabilitation and his prospects are important. I regard it as important to allow him a longer than usual parole period in order for him to increase his prospects of rehabilitation. I therefore propose to fix a non-parole period of fifteen months notionally and an additional period of fifteen months. I say the non-parole period should be notionally fifteen months because Mr Farag has already served some six-and-and-a-half months in prison. He has been in continuous custody on these offences since 15 November 2007. What I propose to do is to round that six-and-a-half months up to seven months and to reduce the non-parole period of fifteen months to eight months. So in respect of the offence of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug the effective overall sentence will be one year and eleven months, that is twenty-three months. It will commence on 15 November 2007 when Mr Farag recommenced his custody and expire on 14 October 2009. The non-parole period will be eight months from 15 November 2007 expiring on 14 July 2008 and the balance of the term will be fifteen months from 15 July 2008 to 14 October 2009.  
       
       
      23. I turn now to the five other offences. Three of them, as I said, I regard as less serious than the other two. The other two are a little more serious than those three, that is the two transactions involving $700 are a little more serious than the three transactions involving one or two hundred dollars. So far as the two transactions involving $700 are concerned, I would commence at a figure of three-and-a-half years for each of those offences. Once again I give Mr Farag the benefit of his plea and exhibit C and I reduce the sentence for each of those two offences from three-and-a-half years which is forty-two months to twenty-one months. Because of his youth and the circumstances of his custody I will reduce those to fifteen months. 
       
       
      24. So far as the three offences involving amounts of $100 and $200 are concerned I regard an appropriate starting figure as three years. After making an allowance for his plea and for exhibit C I reduce those to eighteen months which are further reduced to twelve months to take into account his youth and the circumstances of his custody. I propose to fix all of the sentences for the five drug supply offences, that is the first five offences, so that they run concurrently with each other. They will all be served together at the same time. However I propose to partially accumulate those sentences on top of the sentence for the ongoing supply. I can see the force of Mr Ainsworth’s submission that all of this activity amounted to one episode of criminal behaviour. On the other hand there are no fewer than six offences comprising eight separate occasions upon which Mr Farag elected to distribute this drug into the community. The activity involved in the ongoing supply was itself of a significant degree of criminality. I would regard it as inappropriate to sentence him in a way where he served no additional time for the five previous straight drug supplies. 
       
       
      25. I propose to accumulate them so that effectively he will serve an additional four months. In doing this I will be adjusting the fifteen month sentences for the $700 transactions to a sentence of fourteen months and fourteen days. So in respect of the two drug supply offences involving amounts of $700 for each offence I sentence Mr Farag to fourteen months and fourteen days, that is one year, two months and fourteen days. Those sentences are to run concurrently and to commence on 1 April 2008 and to expire on 14 June 2009. I fix a non-parole period of seven months and fourteen days in respect of each offence. That will commence on 1 April 2008 and expire on 14 November 2008. The balance of the term will be seven months from 15 November 2008 to 14 June 2009. 
       
       
      26. In respect of the three offences involving amounts of $100 to $200. I propose to in each case fix sentences of twelve months without a non-parole period to be served concurrently and to date from 15 November 2007 to 14 November 2008. I have not specified non-parole periods because those sentences of twelve months each are completely concurrent with the non-parole period in respect of the other two slightly more serious supply offences. 
       
       
      27. I make an order directing that Mr Farag be released on parole on 14 November 2008. His parole is to be subject to the following conditions: that he accept the supervision of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service and obey any reasonable directions which it gives relating to his drug rehabilitation including urinalysis; that he reside for the period of his parole either with his parents or with his brother Tamer Farag; thirdly, that he will be of good behaviour during his parole and appear before the Court if called upon to do so; fourthly, that he notify the Registrar of the Penrith District Court of any change in his residential address. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Ainsworth and Mr Murray in a moment I will, as I have to make sure that Mr Farag understands the sentence, and I will run through it again with him, but before I do that are there any orders which I need to make any additional conditions which either of you suggest? 
       
       
      AINSWORTH: No thank you, your Honour. 
       
       
      MURRAY: No your Honour. There is just the order in relation to the destruction of drugs. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Good.  
       
       
      28. Pursuant to s 39P of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 
        
      I order that the drugs involved in this case be destroyed. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Now are the numbers right in the adding up? 
       
       
      AINSWORTH: Yes your Honour they are. 
       
       
      MURRAY: Yes. 
       
       
      AINSWORTH: And I can plainly see what your Honour has done so I can explain it to him.  
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I am obliged by statute to. 
       
       
      AINSWORTH: I’m not suggesting your Honour don’t, but rest assured I understand it and I can explain it to his family. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Thanks. Mr Farag, stand up. You are going to be in gaol for just under another year, do you understand that? 
       
       
      OFFENDER: Yeah. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I have ordered that you be released on parole, and that’s my order not the parole services order, on 14 November 2008. I have given you effectively three sentences. The sentence for the most serious offence which is the ongoing supply, the three supplies of up to $16,000, do you understand that? That’s one sentence. And I have given you a sentence of one year and eleven months, that’s 23 months. Normally I would give you 30 months but because you have done a bit less than seven months in custody I am reducing it to 23 months. Eight months of that you’ve got to be in gaol for, do you understand? So that means that you’re in gaol on that one and all of the sentences date from when you went back into custody last month, 15 November, so that sentence you’ve got to be in gaol from 15 November 2007 to 14 July 2008 and then as it happened you are still in gaol because the other two, three, five straight supplies I have given you 14 and a months for the two involving $700 and I have given you 12 months for the three involving one or two hundred dollars and I have commenced those so that you are serving an additional four months in gaol for those.  
       
       
      So the seven-and-a-half month sentence or rather 14-and-a-month sentence commences on 1 April next year and your non-parole period of seven months and 14 days will finish on 14 November 2008 and that’s when you will be released. Then you are on parole after that until 14 October 2009. So you have got just under a year on parole. And the two less serious offences I have given you one year which will expire at the end of your non-parole period. Whilst you’re on parole I have suggested you be supervised by Probation and Parole, you have been with them before, and I am directing that you accept their recommendations for drug rehabilitation, you are clearly on the right track, you are clearly well-supported as I have said in my judgment and I hope that you continue with that progress that you have made. And you’ve got to notify the Court of any change of address. I have said that you’ve got to stay with your parents or your brother because that seems to be the successful formula so far. 
       
       
      I have heard submissions by Mr Ainsworth, I’ve had to balance the seriousness of what you have been doing which are very serious crimes with clearly your quite exceptional efforts of rehabilitation, so I’ve had to weigh that up. And you have heard me mention the other factors as well which I have taken into account. Your serious crimes started with quite high figures but because of various factors which Mr Ainsworth will explain to you and which you have heard me refer to, your sentences have been reduced quite considerably. Do you understand that? 
       
       
      OFFENDER: Yeah. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Okay, thank you both Mr Ainsworth and Mr Murray for your assistance, I have been grateful.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1 The plaintiff sustained injury at about 4.10 am on 1 August 1998 when he and a companion, Craig Hansen, were involved in a fight with a group of men outside the Aspen Hotel in Jindabyne. 
     
      
    2 Earlier there had been an altercation in the hotel front bar between three members of the group and the plaintiff and Mr Hansen which had resulted in those members of the group being required to leave the premises. The fight occurred some 10-15 minutes later when the plaintiff and Mr Hansen left the hotel and were walking to the plaintiff’s accommodation. 
     
      
    3 The plaintiff’s injuries were significant, and he sought to recover damages for them from the owner and occupier of the hotel (the first defendant), the licensee of the hotel (the second defendant), two of his assailants (the third and fourth defendants), and the supplier of security services to the hotel (the fifth defendant). 
     
      
    4 The proceedings against the fourth defendant were resolved at the commencement of the hearing. The proceedings against the third defendant were discontinued. 
     
      
    5 The plaintiff, in his further amended statement of claim, alleged that the first and second defendants owed a non-delegable duty to take such steps as were necessary for the safety of patrons on and in the vicinity of the premises and that they were vicariously liable for the action or inaction of the fifth defendant in respect of safety and security on the premises. 
     
      
    6 Although the further amended statement of claim alleged a contractual relationship between the first, second and fifth defendants for the provision of security services at the hotel, the nature of any duty owed by the fifth defendant to the plaintiff was not the subject of express pleading. 
     
      
    7 The particulars of negligence which were alleged against the first, second and fifth defendants were:  
     
      
       
        
        “(a) Failing to ensure the safety of the plaintiff in circumstances where the defendants knew, or ought to have known, that the plaintiff was at risk of injury; 
         
         
        (b) Failing to summons the Police to the hotel; 
         
         
        (c) Permitting or allowing the plaintiff’s assailants to remain in close proximity to the hotel upon being ejected; 
         
         
        (d) Inviting, permitting, allowing or requiring the plaintiff to leave the defendant’s premises in circumstances where the plaintiff was affected by the consumption of alcohol and at risk of further attack by his assailants; 
         
         
        (e) Failing to warn the plaintiff of the imminent risk of further injury; 
         
         
        (f) Continuing to serve alcohol to the plaintiff’s ultimate assailants when it was known, or ought to have been known, that excessive quantities of alcohol had been consumed by those persons; 
         
         
        (g) Failing to look, or look adequately, on an inspection outside for the presence of the plaintiff’s assailants prior to ushering the plaintiff out of the back entrance; 
         
         
        (h) Failing to take any or any adequate steps to get the plaintiff home or at least clear of his potential assailants; 
         
         
        (i) Failing to call a taxi for the plaintiff; 
         
         
        (j) Failing to properly supervise and/or instruct security personnel so as to deal with the potential threat to the plaintiff; 
         
         
        (k) Failing to provide adequate security on and in the vicinity of the premises.” 
        
       
      
    8 The first and second defendants denied liability to the plaintiff. In particular, they denied negligence, that they owed the plaintiff a duty of care (non-delegable or otherwise), that they were in breach of any duty of care, that the plaintiff’s injury was caused by negligence on their part, and they denied they were vicariously liable for the action or inaction of the fifth defendant. 
     
      
    9 The fifth defendant also denied liability to the plaintiff. He denied that he owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, or, if he did, that he was in breach of that duty. He also denied that the plaintiff’s injuries were caused by negligence on his part. He alleged that he had provided an employee to the first and second defendants which brought that employee into the service of the first defendant so that the first defendant, not the fifth defendant, was liable for any negligence of that employee. 
     
      
    10 The fifth defendant also relied upon the provisions of the Civil Liability Act, 2002 and asserted that: 
     
      
       
      (a) the conduct of the fifth defendant did not constitute negligence as defined in ss 5B, 5C and 5D of that Act; 
       
        
       
      (b) any risk of injury to the plaintiff from assault was an obvious risk within the meaning of s 5F of that Act and, accordingly, the plaintiff was presumed to be aware of it and there was no duty on the part of the fifth defendant to warn of that risk; 
       
        
       
      (c) the plaintiff was intoxicated within the meaning of that expression in that Act and any duty of care owed to the plaintiff was limited by s 49 of that Act and the plaintiff’s entitlement to recover was limited by s 50 of that Act; 
       
        
       
      (d) the plaintiff’s capacity to exercise reasonable care and skill was impaired by his intoxication which would not have occurred if he had not been intoxicated so the plaintiff was not entitled to recover damages or, alternatively, was required to have his damages reduced by at least twenty-five percent by reason of the provisions of s 50(4) of that Act. 
       
      
    11 The first, second and fifth defendants alleged the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. The fifth defendant (but not the first or second defendants) alleged that the plaintiff, by reason of his conduct in the premises of the first defendant, voluntarily accepted the risk of injury from becoming intoxicated and acting in a provocative and aggressive manner toward other patrons in the hotel. 
     
      
    12 The first and second defendants claimed indemnity or contribution from the fifth defendant pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1946. They also claimed damages for breach of contract. The latter claim was not pressed. The fifth defendant denied any liability to indemnify or contribute to any verdict recovered by the plaintiff against the first and second defendants. 
     
      
    13 The fifth defendant claimed indemnity or contribution from the first and second defendants pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1946. The first and second defendants denied liability to indemnify or contribute to any verdict recovered by the plaintiff against the fifth defendant. 
     
      
    14 The damages recoverable by the plaintiff in the event he was wholly successful in his claim were agreed by the parties.  
     
      
       
      The scene 
       
      
    15 The following evidence, which I accept, was either agreed or not the subject of serious dispute. 
     
      
       
      (a) The hotel building is bordered on the east by Kosciusko Road, on the south by Thredbo Terrace, on the west by an unnamed lane and on the north by a group of shops comprising a strip mall. The unnamed lane intersects with Thredbo Terrace shortly before the intersection of Kosciusko Road and Thredbo Terrace. There is an entry road to a parking area adjoining the lane. The main entrance is by steps leading from the footpath in Kosciusko Road to the front doors of the hotel. The Jindabyne Police Station is located in Thredbo Terrace, a short distance from the hotel. 
       
       
      (b) Within the hotel, there were, at the relevant time, three bars: the cocktail bar, the back bar and the front bar. There was also a restaurant and a bistro. 
       
       
      (c) In 1998 the usual practice was that the restaurant would close first, the cocktail bar would close soon after that and the bistro around 10.00 or 11.00 pm. Patrons remaining in the cocktail bar would be moved into either the back bar or the front bar. At some time during the night, depending upon the number of patrons present on the premises, the back bar would also close. Any remaining patrons in the back bar would be moved into the front bar. As the bars and other facilities were closed, the staff necessary to operate the bars would reduce and their shift would end. 
       
       
      (d) The dimensions of the front bar were 12 metres by 8 metres. At the relevant time as you entered this bar from the road, there was a bar along the right hand wall. On the opposite wall, there was a poker machine to the left of the door, in the opposing corner there was a video game called ‘House of the Dead’. In front of the video machine there was a pool table and beside it there was a normal table, which stood about 4½ feet off the ground. There was a second pool table, closer to the front door. 
       
       
      (e) It was possible to see into and out of the front bar through the front window of the hotel. At the time of the altercation, only the front bar was still open. 
       
       
      The evidence 
       
      
    16 The evidence in the plaintiff’s case was, in summary, as follows: 
     
      
       
      The plaintiff 
       
      
    17 The plaintiff gave evidence that: 
     
      
       
      (a) He was born on 17 August 1974. He had been best friends with Craig Hansen from the age of 13. In April 1998 he obtained work at Perisher in the New South Wales Southern Alps. Mr Hansen obtained work at the Lake Crackenback Resort at about that time. 
       
       
      (b) He had no memory of events at the Aspen Hotel on the night of 31 July, 1 August 1998. His last memory was of snowboarding (though he did not know on which day), his next memory was of waking up weeks later in hospital. The defendants accepted the plaintiff had no memory of relevant events. 
       
       
      (c) He agreed he had used marijuana since aged 16 and that at some stages he used it on a daily basis. He was not using it daily when working at Perisher. He said he also used other drugs but not on a regular basis. He had used cocaine prior to the fight about four times in five years. He agreed that a small packet containing cocaine was found in his wallet after the injury and that he must have put it there. He agreed that he was involved in a serious motor accident in 2002 and that a blood test had revealed alcohol, ecstasy and marijuana in his bloodstream. He agreed cocaine was a stimulant which could make a person disinhibited and could induce a foolish decision. He denied that he became aggressive with drugs. 
       
       
      (d) He was asked if he had had one stubby at his home and six schooners of full strength beer at the tavern that evening whether he “would have been, to some extent, affected by that quantity of alcohol”. He replied: “Yes, if I had had that amount I would have been affected to some extent by, I guess, that quantity of alcohol.” He agreed he would have been “under the influence of that quantity of alcohol”. He agreed that alcohol could diminish inhibitions, could make one agitated, could impair judgment and lead to foolish decisions. He was aware that alcohol could make some persons aggressive. He agreed that he would take every possible means to avoid confrontation with such a person but observed that in licensed premises there should be bouncers present to prevent assault.  
       
       
      (e) He denied being involved in fights in clubs and pubs previously. He agreed it would be foolish to become involved in a fight as he could be seriously injured. He agreed it would be foolish if he saw a fight brewing not to take an evasive course to avoid getting involved as he could be seriously hurt. He said “If I could run away, I would, for sure”.  
       
       
      (f) He said that across from the door where we got let out, there's a concrete pathway that went up past the church and on to the street I lived on. That's the way we would have walked home. We wouldn't have gone left or right [when we left the hotel]. He agreed the back exit which was used was closer to his residence and was the most direct route from the hotel to his residence. He did not think that they had any option to turn right and take a longer route home. He denied he was a willing participant in the fight and said he was not an aggressor. He said that he thought that if they could have run away from the assailants, they would have done so. He was asked: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Do you have any explanation as to why, when you left the Aspen Hotel, you didn’t run away from the assailants?” 
          
         
        
       
       
       to which he replied: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “I remember there was nothing but a dark track up to where I was living and, if we had gone up there, we most probably wouldn’t have made it back anyway. So, we most probably had no choice”. 
          
         
        
       
       
      (g) He was asked: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “But if you sensed any danger at all while you were inside the Aspen Hotel, it would have been sensible for you to call the police, wouldn’t it?” 
          
         
        
       
       
      and he answered: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “I thought that was the hotel’s department.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The question was put again and he agreed it would have been sensible for him to call the police but then, when pressed, he said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “I thought that the security were going to take care of us.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Mr Hansen 
       
      
    18 Mr Hansen gave evidence that: 
     
      
       
      (a) He was aged 23 at the time of the incident and had been a friend of the plaintiff’s since about age 11 or 12. He said he would try to help the plaintiff if he could. 
       
       
      (b) He met the plaintiff around 10.00 pm on 31 July 1998 at the plaintiff’s flat. At that time there was nothing in the plaintiff’s behaviour to indicate he had had anything earlier to drink. Mr Hansen had two beers at the flat. The plaintiff, who was a slower drinker than him, had one. They then went to the Aspen Hotel where he had two beers and the plaintiff might have had one less. They then went to the Lake Jindabyne Hotel. He had two beers. The plaintiff had a drink but he didn’t know how many. They then went to the Aspen Hotel, anywhere from 1.00-2.00 am, to have a game of pool. There he had one and a half beers and the plaintiff had one. In a written statement to the police (Exhibit F), Mr Hansen said the plaintiff had a stubby of beer at the plaintiff’s flat and that he had had about eight schooners of Tooheys Real beer whilst the plaintiff had possibly up to six beers of the same type. Mr Hansen, by his assessment, was medium to well affected by the alcohol he had consumed. The plaintiff, following the altercation, seemed “a bit shaken” but did not appear affected by alcohol at all. 
       
       
      (c) Mr Hansen did not use drugs. He rang the Cooma Hospital about the plaintiff on the day of injury. He said he could have told them that the plaintiff “may have snorted cocaine prior to 10.30 pm”. He did not know if the plaintiff had taken cocaine earlier in the day. 
       
       
      (d) He and the plaintiff were playing pool with two women at the hotel. He saw the plaintiff at the other end of the pool table having a heated discussion “like an argument” with the third defendant. He could not hear what was being said. The third defendant who was about six feet tall and of medium to solid build walked away. The plaintiff was of slight build and well under six feet in height. He then observed the plaintiff in further discussion with the third and fourth defendants. After a short time he looked back and saw the plaintiff had been struck by a punch from one of the men, he did not know which. He walked over to break it up and became involved in the scuffle and got punched to the face. A bouncer came in and broke up the altercation. The matter was all over in a few seconds. Including the plaintiff and Mr Hansen, there were maybe six people involved in the altercation. He did not see the plaintiff behaving aggressively or throwing any punches. One of the bouncers said to him and the plaintiff after the altercation that they could finish their beers and their game of pool and (“from memory”) they were to leave by the back door. He thought that last drinks were called a matter of moments after the altercation. Whilst he and the plaintiff remained in the hotel, the balance of the patrons were leaving. He agreed he saw out the front of the hotel a group of people consistent with a congregation of the patrons who were leaving, saying their goodbyes. 
       
       
      (e) The plaintiff had an old cut on the chin that had been reopened during the altercation. Mr Hansen went to the toilet to get some wet tissues to clean up the cut. When he came back from the toilet he looked out the window and saw a group of people (there may have been up to six in the group) whom he believed to have been in the altercation standing out the front of the hotel. He and the plaintiff resumed the game of pool and finished their beers. From time to time he looked out the window. He did not believe there was any occasion when the group of people was not standing there. At the time he thought he may have seen a bouncer out there talking to the group. During that time he had no concerns for his safety. At the time he left the Aspen Hotel he was not expecting further trouble. He had no thought that he might be confronted by the group of men. If he or the plaintiff had not thought it safe, he agreed he or the plaintiff could have called a cab or the police. During the evening no-one said call the police. 
       
      
    19 Mr Hansen gave the following evidence as to exiting the hotel: 
     
      
       
      (a) “Q. All right. After the ten minutes or so, what happened then?  
       
        
         
          
          A. The bouncer had showed us out the back door - towards the back door.  
           
           
          Q. Just before that, did he say anything to you before he showed you out?  
           
          A. He pretty much just walked us to the back door and opened it up and he said it was right to go and ‘I'll see youse later’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Do you recall anything being said to you about closing time? 
           
          A. No. 
           
           
          Q. At the time you left to go to the back door, did you see where the people who were out the front were still there?  
           
          A. No. I didn't really look at that exact time, as we were leaving.  
           
           
          Q. All right. When you got to the back door, you said that the security fellow said words to the effect ‘It's right to go. See youse later.’ Where did he say that from?  
           
          A. From standing at the back door, as he opened it.  
           
           
          Q. Did he step outside?  
           
          A. No.  
           
           
          Q. Did he appear to you to look outside?  
           
          A. Just looked out. He did look outside when he opened the door, but he didn't go outside.  
           
           
          Q. You're quite sure about that?  
           
          A. Yes. “ 
          
         
        
       
       
      (b) He could not see any handle on the door through which he exited which would permit him to re-open it from the outside. 
       
       
      (c) “Q. When the member of the security staff took you out the exit door, who was then still in the hotel?  
       
        
         
          
          A. Maybe the bar staff were still there.  
           
           
          Q. Were there a number of them?  
           
          A. I can't be exactly sure how many there were.  
           
           
          Q. Do you remember what they were doing?  
           
          A. No, not exactly.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (d) “Q. You went to the back door of the hotel before you left in the company of a security guard and that door was opened by the guard, was it, before you went out?  
       
        
         
          
          A. He had opened the door for us.  
           
           
          Q. Might it be the case that he checked in the laneway by walking up and down before you left the hotel?  
           
          A. No.  
           
           
          Q. Bearing in mind this is 10 years ago, do you have any clear recollection one way or the other?  
           
          A. Yes, I do.  
           
           
          Q. You, however, did look up the laneway before you set off, did you not?  
           
          A. I think we just walked out the back door.  
           
           
          Q. It is the case, isn't it, in relation to what you have said already, that at that point in time no-one was visible at the end of the laneway?  
           
          A. Yes.  
           
           
          Q. It was only when you set off and walked some distance up the laneway that people came into view?  
           
          A. Yes.” 
           
          
         
        
       
      (e) They exited through the back door and proceeded to walk up the back ramp from the hotel [the ramp is otherwise referred to as the lane or laneway] intending to go directly to the plaintiff’s residence. They turned left onto the ramp and intended to turn right at Thredbo Terrace. They were walking. 
       
       
      (f) As he went up the ramp he noticed a group of people, the first of whom was “directly crossing our path”. The group was walking along the street at right angles to the direction taken by the plaintiff and Mr Hansen. When he first saw them, he and the plaintiff had got maybe half way or three-quarters of the way up the ramp. There were probably about six people belonging to the group. They were confronted by the third defendant and another man. One of them said “Look who we’ve found here”. “They were saying things like, ‘Come on, let's fight, let's finish it’”. The plaintiff and Mr Hansen were saying, “Oh, we'll just get out of here, let's go"". The plaintiff said “Let’s get out of here”. He said nothing to indicate that he wanted to have a fight, he did not do anything that was aggressive, and both he and the plaintiff edged away from the group. The plaintiff was punched in the face by the third defendant and knocked to the ground. “I was…punched by the other fellow…and then we started to fight”. He did not see the plaintiff throw a punch at any stage. He was being kicked in the head after he went down. There were maybe four people assaulting them. The time between leaving the back door and the assault occurring was maybe one to two minutes during which he and the plaintiff had moved “maybe a little over 50 metres”. They were in the laneway between 12 and 25 metres from the men when he first saw them. They didn’t come down the laneway. The plaintiff and Mr Hansen walked the 12 to 25 metres to them. 
       
       
      (h) He was not too familiar with Jindabyne. He did not know of any alternate route to that which he and the plaintiff followed from the back door of the hotel. He did not know of anywhere to run. There was no way out before you got up the ramp. The laneway runs to the right. He did not know that on the night though. He would have noticed it if he had looked. He could not turn around to go the other way because he did not know there was one. He did not know he could run into the carpark or get out. As he approached the men, he knew the scuffle was likely to be renewed if they got within arm’s length. He and the plaintiff were not willing participants in the fight. 
       
       
      Sergeant Waldau 
       
      
    20 Sergeant Waldau gave evidence that: 
     
      
       
      (a) He was stationed at Jindabyne Police Station on 1 August 1998. The police station was located in Thredbo Terrace, about one minute’s walk from the Aspen Hotel. It had a bright blue and white illuminated sign at the front. 
       
       
      (b) At about 4.10 am on 1 August 1998 he heard pretty loud yelling from the front of the police station. He went outside and saw five to seven males kicking into a person on the ground about 20 metres away. At the time two other police officers were on duty whilst a third officer was on the premises though not on duty. He alerted these officers and then proceeded to the scene. He ordered the people involved to stay where they were but they moved off. He took hold of Mr Hansen who struggled and ran off. He was pursued and caught by Sgt Waldau. 
       
       
      (c) If a person was confronted by thugs at the intersection of the lane and Thredbo Terrace, there could be several lines of escape open. They could turn and run back down the lane, they could run through the shopping arcade, they could run into the carpark or they could run to the police station. 
       
       
      (d) The police did not receive a phone call from the Aspen Hotel after midnight on the morning in question. If they had, they would have responded to whatever the call may have required them to attend for. If he had been told there was a group causing trouble outside the Aspen Hotel and been asked to disperse the group, he would have attended and dispersed the group. 
       
       
      Constable D’Bras 
       
      
    21 A statement from Constable D’Bras was tendered by the plaintiff. The statement added little to the existing evidence. 
     
      
       
      Mr Gallagher 
       
      
    22 Mr Gallagher gave evidence: 
     
      
       
      (a) He had been at the hotel from about 8.00 or 9.00 pm on 31 July 1998 until closing time. He was 16 years of age at the time. He had had problems with his accommodation at the time and a person named Chris was at the hotel and allowed him to stay at his place. He approached the police about three weeks after the event and offered to give a statement, which he did, after being told by a barman at the hotel, Saul, whom he knew, that the plaintiff had been seriously injured. 
       
       
      (b) He did not know the plaintiff or Mr Hansen but had a game of pool with them. Subsequently, he observed the plaintiff and Mr Hansen playing pool with two women. They were debating a rule when the third defendant walked up to the plaintiff and Mr Hansen and said they just lost the game. There was more discussion which he did not hear. The third defendant then walked off. A few minutes later the third defendant returned and had a further heated discussion with the plaintiff. The third defendant was joined by two other men. Mr Gallagher heard the third defendant saying “Do you guys want to make something of it?” The plaintiff said “It’s only a game of pool”. Mr Gallagher went to get his jacket, then saw the two men with the third defendant push the plaintiff and start throwing punches at him. He did not see the third defendant do anything and did not see the plaintiff throwing any punches. Mr Hansen came over to help the plaintiff. There were about eight people involved in the altercation. The bouncers broke up the fight. Six to eight security persons were involved in breaking it up. All security personnel were dressed in black pants and black shirts, as was the bar staff. There was nothing to distinguish them. The third defendant was quite affected by alcohol, the plaintiff and Mr Hansen were affected by alcohol but not hugely. The security persons ejected everyone involved in the altercation except the plaintiff and Mr Hansen. They were told they would have to leave as well once they had finished their drinks or the next game of pool. 
       
       
      (c) The plaintiff and Mr Hansen resumed their game of pool. Mr Gallagher observed the group of men, including the three involved in the altercation sitting and standing outside through the front window. He observed the third defendant pointing back inside towards the plaintiff and Mr Hansen at one point and “every 15 or 20 seconds he would look inside” to where the plaintiff and Mr Hansen were standing. There were about ten people in the group. There was never a time until the plaintiff and Mr Hansen were taken out the back that the group was not standing outside the front door. 
       
       
      (d) One of the security guards spoke to the plaintiff and Mr Hansen, then led them towards the back exit. The group out the front at that time did not do anything for about 10 or 15 seconds. Then the third defendant looked inside to where the plaintiff and Mr Hansen had been and “he pointed inside and said something to the group and they all stood up and ran off to my right”. It was about 30-40 metres from there to the back door. As soon as he saw the group run off, he went after the plaintiff, Mr Hansen and the security man as “I was quite worried about what was going to happen”, that they were going to continue the fight. “I couldn’t find them…I waited a little while near the door through which I thought they had been taken out” and then he saw the guard who turned up and said he had taken them out the cocktail bar door (which was at the front). That door cannot be opened from the outside without a key. He went back and spoke to the barman, Saul. He said: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “I can't remember the exact words but I said something to the effect that I was quite worried about [the plaintiff] and Mr Hansen, as they had just been let out the back way of the pub and that I had seen a group of men out the front and noticed that they were gone, and they'd run around the back.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (e) There were 15 to 20 people still in the bar area. It was 20 minutes to half an hour before last drinks were called from the time the plaintiff and Mr Hansen left. He left half an hour after the plaintiff and Mr Hansen left. 
       
       
      (f) He agreed he had lied to the police in the statement where he had said he was 18 rather than 16. He could not remember Chris’ surname, could not remember where Chris lived or how he got to Chris’ residence. He did not know Saul’s surname and he did not mention Saul to the police, nor in his statement to the police did he mention speaking to anyone about any concerns he had. In his written statement he said the plaintiff and Mr Hansen had asked to be let out the back way by the bar staff. He could not remember but must have heard it. He never saw the plaintiff throw a punch, do any shoving or do anything aggressive or provocative. 
       
       
      Jason Robinson and Rick Jamison 
       
      
    23 The plaintiff tendered a statement dated 1 August 1998 and part of the transcript of evidence given by Jason Robinson in the criminal proceedings. A further part of the transcript was tendered by the fifth defendant. Mr Robinson stated he had been walking home along Kosciusko Road with Rick Jamison when he observed six males on the corner of Thredbo Terrace and Kosciusko Road. These males turned right into Thredbo Terrace. He was then about 30-40 metres away. When he got to Thredbo Terrace he heard a noise and saw the plaintiff on the ground being kicked in the head and body. He and his companion intervened prior to the arrival of the police. He gave evidence in the criminal proceedings that the people he saw were walking. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As we came, I saw the two groups of guys walk away from the Aspen. They turned right to Thredbo Terrace so by the time I got up to the intersection they were 50 yards up the road and a scuffle already had taken place or was taking place.” 
        
       
       
      In the course of cross examination he said that the men were fighting when he first saw them, however it is clear that he there was referring to when he first saw them after they had proceeded along Thredbo Terrace. This was clarified in re-examination, and he gave the following evidence: 
       
       
        
        “Q. You saw two groups of persons, is that right? 
         
        A. I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that the first time you saw people associated with what happened on Thredbo Terrace? 
         
        A. Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you first saw them, what position were they in relation to the Aspen Hotel? 
         
        A. They were at the front of the Aspen Hotel. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you see these two groups, the configuration as I understand what you told Mr Woodrow was that there was two persons and then 10 metres behind there were four persons? 
         
        A. Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you notice how they moved from the position out the front of the Aspen Hotel to the position on Thredbo Terrace? 
         
        A. They were walking. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you able to describe how they were walking? 
         
        A. Just walking. I was not really paying that much attention at that stage. Just people walking in front of me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What distance were you away from the groups when you first saw them? 
         
        A. 30 or 40, 40 metres I guess. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At some stage they went out of --? 
         
        A. Around the corner. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And right up Thredbo Terrace? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you got to the intersection you say that is when you heard the commotion occurring? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    24 A statement of Rick Jamison dated 7 August 1998 was tendered by the plaintiff. It confirmed observing the plaintiff being attacked. It also recorded that Mr Jamison observed as he walked past the Aspen Hotel that it was closing. 
     
      
       
      Ray Ranger 
       
      
    25 (a) Mr Ranger was a security guard employed by the fifth defendant. He gave evidence at criminal proceedings brought against the third and fourth defendants. Mr Ranger did not give evidence at the hearing but the transcript of his evidence in the criminal proceedings was tendered in reply by the plaintiff. The transcript was of some length. It included the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “A. The first group. What happened - when I asked them what happened, they explained what happened. I asked them - they had calmed down by this stage. There was no - there didn’t seem to be real much animosity between the two parties. I said ‘Righto, when you finish your drinks, do you mind leaving the premises’. They said ‘yes, no problems’, and they finished their drinks and dispersed. 
           
           
          Q. You say they dispersed, did you see where they went? 
           
          A. They went out through the front door, stood around for a few moments. There were a couple of other people out the front. There would have been approximately eight people. After that they stood around and smoked for approximately five minutes and walked off. I was waiting for them to leave. I went and done a full patrol around the hotel area of the premises, and once I thought it was okay to - for the other two people to leave that were involved in the altercation, I let them out in the back door because I couldn’t see anybody around. I thought it was all okay and that was the last I seen of the two gentlemen.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (b) In another part of the transcript, he said that he had waited for about 15 minutes and: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. During that time you had done a patrol? 
           
          A. I done a patrol around the hotel premises and around the shops to make sure there was nobody hanging around or loitering around for their own safety. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Then what happened, you returned to the Aspen? 
           
          A. I returned to the Aspen hotel, spoke to the gentlemen, the two gentlemen, the two gentlemen again that were involved in the incident. I asked them to leave. When I escorted them out the back door, before I let them out the back door I done a full patrol of the carpark and around the general vicinity of the top carpark around, back around the police station. Once I done the patrol everything was fine. I let them out the back door, watched them walk up the road, they were fine, locked the back door and I went back to my normal duties.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (c) In cross examination he had given the following evidence: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. You went outside and checked outside the Aspen? 
           
          A. That is correct. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. How many times did you go round? 
           
          A. Walked around Peddy Plaza, round the shops at Peddy Plaza, round behind the shops, round the back of the carpark of the hotel, back in the front door. Everything was quiet. I didn’t see anybody loitering or anything like that, hanging around. I spoke to the gentlemen again. I said ‘looks pretty safe outside.’ I escorted them out the back door but before I let them out the back door I done a patrol of the premises in the carpark. There was nobody, like nobody around at all. I thought it was all right for their safety. I thought everything was all right. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Couldn’t see anybody out the front? 
           
          A. No. I had already been there. I walked straight in the front of the Aspen, round the back. There was nobody when I walked in the front door, nobody around when I walked out the back door. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. You went inside again? 
           
          A. Yes, I went back to my duties.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (d) He was challenged as to this evidence as follows: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. You see, I suggest to you the true situation was as you explained to Mr Waldau that morning, just reading out an entry, when Ranger saw that the persons of interest were still waiting at the front of the Hotel it was decided to allow the victim to leave the rear exit? 
           
          A. Yes. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. The morning of the 19th you told him [Officer Waldau] when you saw the person of interest still waiting you then decided to allow these two other fellows to leave the rear exit. That is what you told Waldau, isn’t it? 
           
          A. I can’t remember. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. See sir, I suggest to you, you did not go out on patrol? 
           
          A. Excuse me sir - 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. You did not go out on this patrol round the front of the Hotel as you told us? 
           
          A. I did go on patrol at the front of the Hotel. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. You did not go wandering round the back of the carpark area out the back as you told us before releasing these two men out the back as you told us? 
           
          A. I did. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. What you did do, I suggest, was cause people to leave the premises then escort the other two fellows out the back? 
           
          A. When I escorted the two gentlemen out the back door I asked them to stay inside while I went outside. I closed the door off. I done a patrol out the back and let them out once it was all clear…” 
          
         
        
       
      
    26 The evidence in the first and second defendant’s case was, in summary, as follows: 
     
      
       
      Marcus Herstik 
       
      
    27 Mr Herstik gave evidence: 
     
      
       
      (a) He was born in 1977. The second defendant was his father. The hotel was owned by the first defendant, a company controlled by his parents. He had worked part time for the hotel in 1995, full time during the winter seasons in 1996, 1997 and 1998. The hotel staff had a uniform comprising a dark coloured polo shirt with the Aspen emblem on it. 
       
       
      (b) The fifth defendant would supply the security staff and all the security procedures. Ray Ranger was the security guard supplied by the fifth defendant who was on duty at the time of the altercation. The security staff were not employed by the first defendant or the second defendant. Their wages were paid by the fifth defendant. The security guard or guards supplied by the fifth defendant were supplemented from time to time by the staff of the first defendant. If working security, staff wore security jackets with the word “Security” on them and would be told what to do by the guard provided by the fifth defendant. The fifth defendant’s employees had their own uniform. On some nights when it was quiet, the first defendant did not require an employee of the fifth defendant as Messrs Herstik and Kay would provide the security and if Mr Herstik was the duty manager he would make the decisions. Ultimately, in respect of the security personnel he said that his authority would have to prevail as “we are the ones paying the bills but we employ them to do a specific job and would bow to their experience”. 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. You told Mr Hewitt that in relation to decisions about who was put out and things of that sort, you as duty manager had the final say; is that correct?  
           
          A. To some degree, yeah, in consultation with the security guards. Like, if they said that someone should leave, then I'm not going to tell them - I'm not going to tell them that, no, that person's able to stay.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (c) He was the duty manager on the morning of the injury. At the time of the altercation, all patrons were in the front bar. There were between 10 and 20 patrons there. Only two hotel employees were on duty, himself and Graham Kay, each of whom was a qualified security guard. Ray Ranger was also in attendance. The lighting was pretty bright at the time of the altercation, which was normally an indication that last drinks had either been called or were about to be called. The altercation occurred between the plaintiff and Mr Hansen and the third and fourth defendants. A few punches were thrown, a bit from both sides before staff intervened and stopped it. He saw the plaintiff and the fourth defendant exchanging punches. The plaintiff did not appear to be affected by alcohol to any great extent and he and Mr Hansen gave every sign of wanting to avoid trouble. 
       
       
      (d) After the altercation he thought he tidied up a bit and was closing down the bar. He did not know if he looked outside, though he had no recollection of a large group of people out the front. However, once all the lights are on the tinted windows make it a bit hard to see through the bar and it depends on where the people are standing. 
       
       
      (e) He had known the fourth defendant for four years prior to the incident. They used to be in ski racing together. He had known the fourth defendant’s brother for seven years. All three men were regular attendees at the hotel. He had not seen anything which suggested the fourth defendant or his brother were violent. He did not know the third defendant as well but there was not really a violent tendency through the group. So far as he was aware, they had never caused a problem at the hotel. As the persons involved in the altercation were being separated, he heard the third defendant say, “Come on outside, we’ll see who is the man.” He accepted he may have given evidence one of the group was still a little bit agitated and did not feel it was quite finished. However, as they walked out the door, he could hear the fourth defendant telling the third defendant not to be an idiot. He said that if he had seen the third or fourth defendant or the latter’s brother pointing inside the front room, he would not have been concerned. Nor was there anything that happened [prior to the fight] which warranted calling the police. The third and fourth defendants and the latter’s brother left through the front doors of the hotel. The plaintiff and Mr Hansen left through a rear door of the hotel. This accorded with standard industry practice at the time and was a procedure which was successful in preventing further breaches of the peace. The bar was being closed at the time the plaintiff and Mr Hansen left. He pointed out that a large group of persons outside the hotel was not in itself a dangerous thing as the members of the group, for example, could be waiting for a cab or to be picked up etc and it would be hard to determine whether they were “spoiling for a fight”.  
       
       
      (f) He acknowledged a duty of care to patrons. He agreed that if the conclusion was reached that the persons outside were spoiling for a fight, he could call the police, tell the group to go home, call a taxi, leave the plaintiff and Mr Hansen in the hotel or escort them to the police station. 
       
       
      (g) He had no recollection of the person called Saul being employed at the hotel. There was no-one called Saul working at the hotel at the time of the altercation.  
       
       
      Record book 
       
      
    28 A record book of the fifth defendant contained the following entries for 31 July 1998 and 1 August 1998:

        31.7.98 At approximately 23.00 an altercation broke out between four people in the back bar. Two people wound up down the stairs between the cocktail bar. We removed the four people involved. 
         
         
         3.40 am Another altercation broke out in the public bar between four people over a game of pool. Graham gave me a hand to escort two of them out the front door. Whilst I tried to calm down the other two after I did calm these down. I let them out the back door after I had checked to make sure the area was all clear. 
         
         R. Ranger 
         
         
        1.8.98 02.45 On the corner out the front of the pub an altercation broke out between three people. I broke it up. There was no real damage to anyone. The police arrived 30 seconds after I sorted it out and told them to go home. 
         
         R. Ranger 
        
       
       
      Medical records 
       
      
    29 The first and second defendants tendered various medical records which contained histories describing the plaintiff as a binge drinker and user of drugs. One note stated that the plaintiff was a user of drugs, including cannabis and cocaine, on a regular basis. Another note said he did not use cocaine on a regular basis and another note said he used marijuana regularly but denied other drugs. A note of Cooma Hospital dated 1 August 1998 stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Call from witness of assault Craig Hansen. Allegedly beaten by 6 men outside Jindabyne Nightclub. Witness was with Clinton from 10.30 pm. Clinton may have ‘snorted cocaine prior to 10.30 pm’. Alcohol ingestion only reported from 10.30 pm until 0230am. Some hint of marijuana smoking.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Jones v Dunkel 
       
      
    30 A Jones v Dunkel inference was sought to be drawn against the first and second defendants as Mr Kay was not called. There was evidence the first defendant had sold the hotel some years ago. It may be inferred there is a high turnover of employees in the snowfields. There was no evidence Mr Kay was available to the first defendant or second defendant. The plaintiff had access to the evidence of the criminal proceedings and presumably to the statements of Mr Kay. It is not apparent if the plaintiff was aware of Mr Kay’s present whereabouts. In the circumstances, I am not prepared to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference adverse to the first and second defendants in respect of Mr Kay. 
     
      
    31 The evidence in the fifth defendant’s case was that of Mr Stenning. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of Mr Stenning 
       
      
    32 Mr Stenning gave evidence he knew the third defendant as they had attended high school together. He was at the Aspen Hotel when the altercation occurred. He heard the third defendant and a person unknown to him arguing over whose game of pool it was next. He observed a bit of pushing and shoving and saw the unknown person give the third defendant a push “and that was basically what happened first”. After the pushing took place, “there was a fight, there were punches”. He did not completely see who threw the first punch but he did remember the unidentified person being aggressive towards the third defendant. He tried to break it up. Employees of the hotel broke up the fight and Mr Stenning and others were escorted out. He waited for a moment outside, then left. He said he had initially been drinking at the Lake Jindabyne Hotel since about 5.00 pm on 31 July 1998. He was drinking full strength beer at the rate of about 2-2½ beers per hour. He then went to the Aspen Hotel where he continued drinking full strength beer, possibly at much the same rate as he had been drinking at the Lake Jindabyne Hotel. He had given a verbal statement to a solicitor a few months after the event; otherwise he had not been asked to remember what had happened until during the week before giving evidence. Cross examination of Mr Stenning revealed a very poor or non-existent recollection of surrounding events.  
     
      
       
      Assessment of the witnesses 
       
      
    33 I generally accept the evidence of Messrs Hansen, Robinson, Jamison Herstik, Sgt Waldau and Const D’Bras as to the events of the morning of 1 August 1998. I bear in mind when considering that evidence that memories may have dimmed to some extent by reason of the passage of time since 1998, that in the case of Mr Hansen he is a long-time friend of the plaintiff and wished to assist him and that Mr Herstik, though the son of the licensee, was accepted by plaintiff’s senior counsel as a witness of truth. 
     
      
       
      Mr Gallagher 
       
      
    34 The defendants mounted an overall challenge to the evidence of Mr Gallagher. They submitted that his evidence was unsatisfactory and should not be accepted unless there was independent corroboration. It was contended adverse demeanour based findings as well as other adverse findings should be made. I accept these submissions and reject Mr Gallagher’s evidence unless independently corroborated. I do so by reason of adverse demeanour findings and discrepancies between Mr Gallagher’s evidence and that of other witnesses whose evidence I accept. In particular: 
     
      
       
      (a) The cross examination of Mr Gallagher essentially commenced with a series of questions about whether he had used the name Malcolm Cox, his address and his employment. The questions were simple yet Mr Gallagher responded slowly, hesitatingly, whilst looking up and down and generally creating an adverse impression. 
       
       
      (b) He gave evidence he knew a bar tender at the hotel named Saul. It was this person who told him of the plaintiff’s injury which resulted in him going to the police. He said Saul had been working as barman in the front bar at the time of the altercation and Mr Gallagher had confided to him his fears about the danger to the plaintiff when he left the hotel. However, he did not know Saul’s surname. Mr Herstik had no recollection of an employee of that name and denied any person of that name was working at the hotel at the time of the altercation. Mr Gallagher did not mention Saul in his statement to the police. 
       
       
      (c) Mr Gallagher said that last drinks were called 20-30 minutes after the plaintiff and Mr Hansen left the hotel and he did not leave until half a hour after the plaintiff left. However, Mr Herstik said the lights were pretty bright at the time of the altercation, which indicated that last drinks had either been called or were about to be called at that time. Mr Hansen said last drinks had been called a matter of moments after the altercation and Mr Jamison observed the hotel was closing when he walked by. 
       
       
      (d) Mr Gallagher said there were 15-20 people in the bar area when the plaintiff and Mr Hansen left. Mr Hansen said that whilst he and the plaintiff remained at the hotel the balance of patrons was leaving and when he left maybe the bar staff were still there. 
       
       
      (e) Mr Gallagher said six to eight security people were involved in breaking up the altercation. Mr Herstik’s evidence was that he, Mr Kay and Mr Ranger broke up the altercation. Mr Hansen thought one bouncer broke up the altercation whilst there was another one or two nearby. 
       
       
      (f) Mr Gallagher gave evidence he was told the plaintiff and Mr Hansen were let out the cocktail bar door. That door is at the front of the hotel, not at the rear. 
       
       
      (g) Mr Gallagher said that the third defendant was looking through the window at the plaintiff and Mr Hansen every 15-20 seconds. That should mean that he had the group under continuous surveillance, which in itself is improbable, yet he told no-one at that stage of his alleged concern. 
       
       
      (h) He said he observed the third defendant and a group of men run from the front of the hotel 15-20 seconds after the plaintiff and Mr Hansen left the front bar. Mr Robinson’s evidence was that he observed that the men were walking and he saw them turn right into Thredbo Terrace. Mr Hansen said the men were walking when he saw them. If they had been running with the intent of fighting with the plaintiff, they would have reached the back door at about the time the plaintiff and Mr Hansen would have emerged, this did not occur. 
       
       
      (i) Despite his alleged concerns, he did not venture from the hotel to see if his fears were well founded. 
       
       
      (j) He could not remember the name of the man Chris who put him up for the night or where Chris lived or how he got to Chris’ residence. 
       
       
      (k) Mr Gallagher was prepared to attend licensed premises whilst under age and lie to police about his age. 
       
       
      Mr Ranger 
       
      
    35 There is a difficulty with the evidence of Mr Ranger. As previously stated, his evidence was given by the tender of a transcript of his evidence in the criminal proceedings. It was tendered by the plaintiff in reply. Senior counsel for the plaintiff contended that notwithstanding he had tendered the evidence of Mr Ranger I should regard Mr Ranger as a liar. I am unable to determine whether Mr Ranger is a liar on the evidence before me. I am unable to determine whether he was concerned for the plaintiff and Mr Hansen’s safety or whether he had any reason for concern for them. I am unable to determine if he carried out the patrols which he said he did. I am unable to determine whether he carried out no patrols and simply lied once he was aware of the events that in fact occurred. I am unable to determine, if he did carry out the patrols he said he did, whether they were done with reasonable care or not. It is possible that when he made his patrol at the front the third and fourth defendants and the latter’s brother had temporarily dispersed or hidden.  
     
      
    36 There was evidence from Mr Hansen that when he was leaving Mr Ranger looked out the back door and told Mr Hansen and the plaintiff it was right to go. Insofar as Mr Ranger was indicating the lane was clear, he was correct. There is no satisfactory evidence Mr Hansen or the plaintiff understood Mr Ranger’s comments were to be taken more widely or that they relied upon them.  
     
      
    37 The plaintiff relied upon a Jones v Dunkel submission as regards Mr Ranger as against the first, second and fifth defendants. In my opinion, that submission is not available against the first and second defendants. There was no evidence Mr Ranger was in the camp of the first and second defendants. Indeed, there were cross actions between the first and second defendants and the fifth defendant. The Jones v Dunkel submission may not be available against the fifth defendant as, by tendering the transcript, the plaintiff has placed Mr Ranger’s evidence before the Court. Even if it was open to draw an inference against the fifth defendant that had Mr Ranger been called his evidence would not have assisted the fifth defendant, such an inference does not assist me in determining what conclusions I should draw from Mr Ranger’s evidence. 
     
      
       
      Mr Stenning 
       
      
    38 Having regard to the amount of alcohol Mr Stenning ingested prior to the altercation, the absence of any contemporaneous record from which to refresh his recollection, his lack of recall of most details and the long passage of time since it occurred, I am unable to accept his evidence as reliable. Accordingly, I have accorded it no weight in my determination. 
     
      
       
      Some factual findings 
       
      
    39 I make the following factual findings: 
     
      
       
      (a) The evidence establishes that the plaintiff on occasions was a binge drinker. The evidence before me is that the plaintiff had consumed no more than six schooners and a stubby of beer over the period from about 10.00 pm to 4.00 am the following day. There was evidence from Mr Hansen that the plaintiff was not affected and from Mr Herstik that he was not much affected. There was no scientific evidence of the amount of alcohol the plaintiff had consumed or its effect. In the circumstances, I place particular weight on the observations of Mr Herstik. I conclude the plaintiff’s faculties were not affected by alcohol to any degree which was of significance. 
       
       
      (b) The evidence established the plaintiff had been a drug user since age 16. However, the evidence does not establish he had consumed drugs on 31 July 1998 or 1 August 1998 or if he had that he was manifesting any effect therefrom. 
       
       
      (c) At the time of the altercation only the front bar was open and there were only two employees working in the bar and the security guard, Mr Ranger, was on duty. This level of staffing was appropriate. 
       
       
      (d) The plaintiff did not start the altercation. The plaintiff was not bound to walk away from his discussion with the third defendant. He did not know he was going to be assaulted. If during the altercation he threw some punches, he would have been entitled to defend himself. 
       
       
      (e) The altercation was terminated within a few moments by the hotel staff and the third and fourth defendants and the latter’s brother were escorted from the hotel through the front door. 
       
       
      (f) Last drinks were called immediately after the altercation. 
       
       
      (g) The plaintiff and Mr Hansen were allowed to finish their drinks and their game of pool. They were asked to leave as it was closing time. By the time they left, few, if any, patrons remained. 
       
       
      (h) The plaintiff and Mr Hansen left through a back door. It is unclear if the back door was used because there had been an altercation or because the plaintiff asked to use the back door as it was closest to his accommodation. Both reasons may have applied. 
       
       
      (i) The method of separating combatants and taking them out separate doors complied with standard industry practice and was a successful practice. 
       
       
      (j) The third and fourth defendants and the latter’s brother generally remained in the street outside the hotel after the altercation. They may have temporarily dispersed. They were joined from time to time by other patrons as they left the hotel. There was no acceptable evidence that the third defendant was pointing at the plaintiff and Mr Hansen or behaving in any threatening manner whilst in the street outside the hotel. It is unclear if Mr Herstik looked through the window and saw the group as he does not recollect now if he did. 
       
       
      (k) At the time the plaintiff and Mr Hansen left the hotel, Mr Hansen had no concern for his safety, he was not expecting further trouble and had no thoughts that he might be confronted by the group of men. I infer the plaintiff was of like mind as there was no acceptable evidence that he did or said anything to the contrary. The plaintiff and/or Mr Hansen could have rung the police or for a cab had they wished. 
       
       
      (l) After a time the third and fourth defendants and the fourth defendant’s brother and a number of other men walked along Kosciusko Road and turned into Thredbo Terrace. They did not run nor did they proceed into the lane. When first observed by Mr Hansen, they were walking across the road. The third defendant, on observing the plaintiff, said “Look who we’ve found here”. Whether the meeting was coincidental or intended by the group was not clear and I do not find the plaintiff has established the meeting was intentional. 
       
       
      (m) Mr Herstik did not know which direction the plaintiff and Mr Hansen would go when they left the hotel. The plaintiff and Mr Hansen did not take the path up the hill which was the shortest route to his accommodation but instead continued to walk up the path to Thredbo Terrace. Why this occurred is not apparent from the evidence. 
       
       
      (n) Mr Hansen was 12½-25 metres from the top of the laneway when he first observed the third defendant. I infer the plaintiff first observed the third defendant about the same time. The group commenced to make comments that indicated they proposed to fight. 
       
       
      (o) Mr Hansen and the plaintiff continued to walk up the path towards the group. There were a number of escape routes available to the plaintiff and Mr Hansen. Mr Hansen may have been unfamiliar with them but the plaintiff had been working at Perisher since April 1998 and was living a short distance from the hotel. 
       
       
      (p) It is unclear, and I am unable to find on the balance of probabilities, that if the plaintiff and Mr Hansen had retreated the group would have followed and if they did whether they would have succeeded in catching them. 
       
       
      The liability of the first and second defendants 
       
       
      The duty of care 
       
      
    40 The first and second defendants have denied that a duty of care was owed by them to the plaintiff in respect of the injuries sustained by him. The submission was put on a number of bases which are dealt with hereunder. 
     
      
       
      A.  
      Generally 
       
      
    41 In order to consider this submission, particular regard must be had to general principles and three recent decisions of the Court of Appeal, namely Spedding v Nobles [2007] NSWCA 29, Wagstaff v Haslem [2007] NSWCA 28, and Collingwood Hotel Pty Ltd v O’Reilly [2007] NSWCA 155, which, in my opinion, are binding upon me. I note the formal submission by counsel for the fifth defendant that these decisions are erroneous. 
     
      
    42 There are two general principles which are relevant in this context. They are: 
     
      
       
      (a) “It is, however, exceptional to find in the law a duty to control another's actions to prevent harm to strangers. The general rule is that one man is under no duty of controlling another man to prevent his doing damage to a third.” -  
      Smith v Leurs 
       (1945) 70 CLR 256 at 262; and 
       
       
      (b) “…an obligation to exercise reasonable care must be contrasted with an obligation to prevent harm occurring to others. The former, not the latter, is the requirement of the law. In  
      Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil 
      , Gleeson CJ pointed to the remarks of Brennan J in  
      Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman 
       and observed that ‘the common law distinguishes between an act affecting another person, and an omission to prevent harm to another. If people were under a legal duty to prevent foreseeable harm to others, the burden imposed would be intolerable.’ In  
      Heyman 
      , Brennan J had emphasised that the common law recognises ‘a duty to take reasonable care to avoid doing what might cause injury to another, not a duty to act to prevent injury being done to another by that other, by a third person, or by circumstances for which nobody is responsible’.” -  
      Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer 
       [2007] HCA 42; (2007) 81 ALJR 1773 at [51]. 
       
      
    43 In Desmond v Cullen (2001) 34 MVR 186 the court was concerned with a patron of a hotel who was injured when struck by a car on his way home. Grove J, with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed, said at [41]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept that the duty of care of an innkeeper extends to refraining from serving intoxicating liquor to the apparently inebriated and, if inebriation does occur, to take reasonable steps in the circumstances in respect to the safety of the inebriate.” 
        
       
      
    44 However in South Tweed Heads Rugby League Football Club Ltd v Cole (2002) 55 NSWLR 113 this exception to the general principle was rejected as mere dicta. Ipp AJA, as he then was, (and with whom Heydon and Santow JJA agreed) stated at [175]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, save perhaps in extraordinary cases, the law should not recognise a duty of care to protect persons from harm caused by them becoming intoxicated by alcohol following a deliberate and voluntary decision on their part to drink to excess.” 
        
       
      
    45 The conclusion of the Court of Appeal in South Tweed was upheld on appeal to the High Court [2004] HCA 29 though on various grounds. Callinan J commented at [121]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The voluntary act of drinking until intoxicated should be regarded as a deliberate act taken by a person exercising autonomy for which that person should carry personal responsibility in law.”  
        
       
      
    46 A further exception was recognised in a number of cases in which it was held: 
     
      
       
        
        “…that someone in the position of a hotel manager or licensee may be liable for injury to a patron caused by the deliberate and unlawful act of another patron.” -  
        Collingwood 
         at [21] 
        
       
      
    47 The basis for this duty initially was said to rest upon the general duty of care on the part of an occupier to take reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to an entrant: see South Tweed at [151]-[153]. 
     
      
    48 In later cases the duty was said to: 
     
      
       
        
        “…depend upon the capacity, and indeed the statutory obligation, of the hotel manager or licensee to control conduct on licensed premises, pursuant to ss 103 and 125 of the  
        Liquor Act  
        1982 (NSW). These provisions not only permit the licensee to ‘turn out, or cause to be turned out’ any person who is intoxicated, and to use reasonable force to that end, but also impose an obligation on a licensee not to permit intoxication on licensed premises” -  
        Collingwood 
         at [21] 
        
       
      
    49 The terms of the relevant provisions of the Liquor Act are concerned only with the control of conduct on the licensed premises. Similarly, the duty as occupier arises by virtue of the control of the relevant premises and in respect of events occurring thereon. 
     
      
    50 This was confirmed in Spedding at [50]: 
     
      
       
        
        “…it is clear from the authorities which have upheld the existence of a duty of care owed by a licensee to patrons that that conclusion depends not on the existence of a ‘special relationship’ recognised by law, but on the element of control.” 
        
       
      
    51 Mason P in Oxlade v Gosbridge Pty Ltd (Court of Appeal, 18 December 1998, unreported) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whatever the outer limits of such duty it encompasses the protection of a patron while he or she is on or departing from the licensed premises.” 
        
       
       
      That was a case where the injury was sustained in the carpark of a hotel and was thus within the area under the control of the hotelier. 
       
      
    52 In Desmond v Cullen Grove J (with whom the other members of the court agreed) said at [41]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fact that an occurrence takes place beyond the physical limits of the hotel and its curtilages does not necessarily take it outside of the range of duty nor does it inevitably demonstrate discharge of duty. It is not practicable to mark the limits of potential liability nor is it required for present purposes as, for reasons to which I now turn, the appellant's claim against the respondent must fail.” 
        
       
      
    53 No other case of liability arising from injury occurring outside a hotel and its curtilage has been brought to my attention. The relevant comment in Desmond v Cullen is dicta and not binding. 
     
      
    54 In Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil (2000) 205 CLR 254 the High Court was concerned with: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the principle upon which an occupier of land may be liable, in an action for negligence, to a person who, whilst on the land, is injured as a result of the deliberate wrongdoing of a third party.” - at [2] 
        
       
       
      The court held: 
       
       
        
        “[36] The appellant is entitled to succeed upon the ground that its duty as an occupier of land did not extend to taking reasonable care to prevent physical injury to the first respondent resulting from the criminal behaviour of third parties on that land.” 
        
       
       
      In the course of his judgment Gleeson CJ, with whom Gaudron and Hayne JJ agreed, held: 
       
       
        
        “[15] The first respondent suffered personal injury, the direct and immediate cause of which was the deliberate wrongdoing of the three men who attacked him. If the attack had occurred in a nearby street, or anywhere other than on land occupied by the appellant, there would have been no possible basis for attributing liability to the appellant. It is the appellant's occupation of the land on which the attack occurred that is the basis for a claim…” 
        
       
      
    55 In my opinion, the duty of care owed by the first and second defendants relevantly extended only to preventing injury to the plaintiff on the premises under their control. It did not encompass a duty of care where injury to the plaintiff was occasioned by the deliberate wrongdoing of persons over whom the defendants had no control in a public street. 
     
      
       
      B.  
      Knowledge of manager and licensee 
       
      
    56 In Collingwood it was held at [21]: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the relevant duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of patrons, depends upon proof that the hotel manager or licensee knew or ought to have known facts requiring intervention to protect patrons and, in those circumstances, failed to take reasonable steps to safeguard the plaintiff from a foreseeable risk of harm” 
        
       
      
    57 Even with the benefit of hindsight, it is was not clear on the evidence before me whether the meeting of the group with the plaintiff and Mr Hansen on Thredbo Terrace was the result of a deliberate intention to resume hostilities or simply chance. The coincidence in time suggests a deliberate intent, the fact the group was walking and did not venture down the lane suggests chance. The opening words “Look who we’ve found here” are consistent with both a chance meeting and feigned surprise. 
     
      
    58 However it is necessary to determine whether Mr Herstik knew or ought to have known facts requiring intervention to protect patrons. There is evidence at [27](e) of this judgment in relation to this aspect of the matter. I accept that evidence.  
     
      
    59 Mr Herstik could not recall looking out the window. Had he done so, the only acceptable evidence was that he may have seen the men and other persons standing outside the hotel but not doing anything which would have caused alarm. 
     
      
    60 He knew that the plaintiff and Mr Hansen were to leave by the back door in accordance with industry standard practice. He knew that the plaintiff and Mr Hansen could go in either direction in the lane or up the path. He knew the men who had been put out the front door had a number of options as to the route they would follow. 
     
      
    61 In my opinion, it has not been established that Mr Herstik knew or ought to have known facts requiring intervention to protect patrons. 
     
      
    62 I am fortified in that conclusion by the fact that Mr Hansen had no concerns for his safety and was not expecting further trouble when he left the hotel. At that time he had no thoughts of being confronted by the group of men. 
     
      
    63 Similarly there was no acceptable evidence the plaintiff expressed or exhibited any concerns in this regard yet he was in a better position than anyone, by reason of his involvement in the argument and altercation, to observe and determine whether the group was a danger. 
     
      
    64 Accordingly, I conclude that even if, contrary to the opinion expressed above, there was a general duty of care, that duty did not apply having regard to these circumstances. Alternatively, if this aspect is to be considered from the perspective of breach, that in the circumstances there was no breach by reason of the defendants not taking any additional steps to protect the plaintiff. 
     
      
       
      C.  
      Willing participant in fight 
       
      
    65 The defendants submitted the plaintiff was a willing participant in the fight as a result of which no duty of care was owed to him. If the plaintiff willingly participated in the fight that would, in my opinion, amount to a deliberate act taken by a person exercising autonomy for which that person should carry personal responsibility in law - South Tweed per Callinan J at [121] and no duty of care would be owed. 
     
      
    66 The fact that the plaintiff and Mr Hansen, instead of retreating, continued along the lane when they knew the group was ahead and indicating a desire to fight is difficult to understand. I find it was not a consequence of a desire to engage in a fight. I so find because the plaintiff and Mr Hansen, according to the evidence, had not earlier showed a desire to get involved in an altercation and it would be improbable that they would deliberately involve themselves in a fight when they were outnumbered six persons to two. 
     
      
       
      Vicarious liability 
       
      
    67 It was submitted the first and second defendants were vicariously liable for any negligence of Mr Ranger. However Mr Ranger was a employee of the fifth defendant by whom his salary was paid and whose uniform he wore. Prima facie, the first and second defendants were not vicariously liable for any negligence of Mr Ranger’s - Sweeney v Boylan Nominees Pty Ltd (2006) 80 ALJR 900 particularly at [13], [32] and [33]. 
     
      
    68 The fifth defendant submitted Mr Ranger had become the employee pro hac vice of the first and/or second defendants. The only evidence as to the contractual arrangements between the first and/or second defendants and the fifth defendant and work arrangements was given by Mr Herstik (see [27](b) above), which evidence I accept. That evidence does not establish that Mr Ranger was an employee pro hac vice of the first and/or second defendants at the relevant time as it fails to demonstrate the necessary assumption of a right of control over the manner in which the individual does his work.  
     
      
    69 I find the first and second defendants were not vicariously liable for any negligence by Mr Ranger. 
     
      
       
      Breach of duty 
       
      
    70 If, contrary to my opinion, Mr Herstik should have been aware of a risk the group may have sought to continue the fight and should have taken steps to obviate or reduce that risk, it becomes necessary to consider the question of breach of duty. 
     
      
    71 It was suggested the defendants could have called a cab, called the police to take the plaintiff and Mr Hansen to their accommodation, sought to disperse the group, escorted the plaintiff and Mr Hansen clear of the premises or to the police station, or kept the plaintiff and Mr Hansen on the premises. 
     
      
    72 As observed in Neindorf v Junkovic (2005) 80 ALJR 341 at [93]: 
     
      
       
        
        “This inquiry about what would have been reasonable and practicable is not to be undertaken in hindsight.” 
        
       
      
    73 There is no evidence that the plaintiff and Mr Hansen would have assessed the risk (without the benefit of hindsight) as such that they would have agreed that a cab should be called, the police should be contacted or they should remain longer at the premises. The opposite is likely as the evidence was that the plaintiff had earlier expressed a desire to go home, the plaintiff and Mr Hansen could have contacted a cab or the police had they wished to yet they had not done so. It was not established a cab would come at that time of night for a small fare for a distance of less than a kilometre or that the police would convey the plaintiff and Mr Hansen to their accommodation. 
     
      
    74 There is no evidence the group would have dispersed if requested to do so by the defendants and the defendants’ manpower was not such that more than one employee (if that) was available to escort the plaintiff and Mr Hansen clear of the premises or to the police station. There was no evidence that a single escort would have deterred the group from attacking if that was their intent. The group’s behaviour after the police arrival at the fight suggests the contrary. The risk presumably would be slight and the need for the work at the hotel to be interrupted to provide an escort is a relevant consideration. 
     
      
    75 I am not satisfied that the steps which the plaintiff asserts should have been taken were either practicable or reasonable or would have been taken following consultation with the plaintiff and Mr Hansen or would have avoided injury. 
     
      
    76 In my opinion, the plaintiff has failed to establish liability on the part of the first and second defendants. There will be a verdict and judgment for the first and second defendants. 
     
      
       
      The fifth defendant’s liability 
       
      
    77 The plaintiff alleged the fifth defendant was vicariously liable for the negligence of Mr Ranger. No other allegation of negligence was made against the fifth defendant. 
     
      
    78 The fifth defendant was contracted to provide services which included giving effect to the obligations of the first and second defendants. 
     
      
    79 I have concluded the first and second defendants owed no relevant duty to the plaintiff. In these circumstances, I see no basis upon which to impose a duty upon the fifth defendant. 
     
      
    80 Even if the fifth defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, the plaintiff has not, in my opinion, established breach on the part of the fifth defendant (see paras [35]-[37] hereof). In my opinion, the plaintiff has not established liability on the part of the fifth defendant. 
     
      
    81 There will be a verdict and judgment for the fifth defendant. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    82 Having regard to the foregoing conclusions, it is unnecessary to further consider causation, the application of the Civil Liability Act, 2002, or the issues of volenti, contributory negligence or apportionment. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    83 I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Verdict and judgment for the first, second and fifth defendants. 
       
       
      2. Plaintiff to pay the costs of the first, second and fifth defendants. 
       
       
      3. Verdict and judgment for the cross defendant, with costs, on the amended first cross claim. 
       
       
      4. Verdict and judgment for the cross defendants, with costs, on the amended second cross claim.

      JUDGMENT  
      (On applications for discharge of two jurors) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: On 6 December 2007, two applications were made for discharge of jurors: 
     
      
       
      (a) a discharge application by a juror (“the employment juror”);  
       
       
      (b) an application by the Accused for the discharge of another juror (“the pregnant juror”). 
       
       
      I use these terms as shorthand descriptions only of the relevant jurors to assist an understanding of what follows.  
       
      
    2 The present trial of the Accused commenced on 13 June 2007 with an estimate of four months (T2.11). On 2 August 2007, I discharged a juror and directed, under s.22 Jury Act 1977, that the trial proceed before a jury of 11: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 27) [2007] NSWSC 838. Since then, two judgments have dealt with other jury issues: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 31) [2007] NSWSC 1213 (application by Accused for discharge of juror); R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 32) [2007] NSWSC 1302 (jury decision to change foreperson).3 On 4 December 2007, the members of the jury retired to consider their verdicts.  
     
      
    4 The discharge application made by the employment juror was initially opposed by the Crown and was consistently opposed by Mr Sutherland SC, for the Accused. After certain developments on 6 December 2007, to which reference will be made, the Crown submitted that an order discharging the employment juror should be made. The Crown submitted that an order should be made that the trial proceed, following the discharge of that juror, with a jury of 10 under s.22 Jury Act 1977.  
     
      
    5 Mr Sutherland SC submitted that the pregnant juror should be discharged and that the trial should proceed under s.22 Jury Act 1977 on 6 December 2007 with a jury of 10 (including the employment juror). The Crown opposed the Defence application for discharge of the pregnant juror.  
     
      
    6 On 6 December 2007, I made an order discharging the employment juror and a further order that the trial continue with a jury of 10 under s.22 of the Act. I declined to discharge the pregnant juror. I refused an application by the Accused to discharge the jury. I stated that I would provide reasons for those orders at a later time. This judgment contains my reasons for those orders. 
     
      
       
      Applicable Legal Principles 
       
      
    7 The general legal principles applicable on an application to discharge individual jurors are clear: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 26) [2007] NSWSC 819 at [8]-[10]. 
     
      
    8 Section 22 Jury Act 1977 does not expressly confer upon the Court a power or discretion to discharge an individual juror, however, that is assumed as a common law or implied or inherent power: Wu v The Queen [1999] 199 CLR 99 at 114 [46], 118 [54]; R v Radju [2001] 53 NSWLR 471 at 475 [17]; Petroulias v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 134 at [17], [58]. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    9 Section 22 relieves the Court of the common law mandatory obligation to discharge the entire jury and permits continuation of the trial with a jury of 10 if the Court so orders: s.22(a)(i) Jury Act 1977; Wu v The Queen at 106 [21], 107 [27], 112 [42], 114 [46]; Brownlee v The Queen [2001] 207 CLR 278 at 289 [22]-[23], 296 [51], 331 [149], 342 [186]; R v Radju at 475 [17]. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    10 There are two separate steps to the process - firstly, whether the juror should be discharged and, if that occurs, whether the trial should continue with a jury of 10: Wu v The Queen at 103 [8], 107 [26]; R v Radju at 475 [18]. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    11 There is no closed category of circumstances which may warrant the discharge of a juror during a trial. Usual circumstances involve illness on the part of a juror or some event or revelation which otherwise impacts upon the appropriateness of the juror continuing to serve.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    12 In Wu v The Queen, Gleeson CJ and Hayne J, at 103 [9] observed that the decision to discharge a juror may require consideration of difficult questions of fact and degree. At 103 [6], their Honours observed that the conduct of, or circumstances affecting, a single juror may require that juror's discharge, although that conduct or those circumstances may not affect the other members of the jury or suggest that they cannot perform their task satisfactorily.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    13 As Simpson J (Hodgson JA and Barr J agreeing) observed in R v Reardon (2002) 186 FLR 1, at 23 [96], s.22 Jury Act 1977 envisages a very broad power or discretion in relation to the discharge of individual jurors, as reference is made to discharge where a juror is “through illness incapable of continuing to act” but broadens that scope by addition of the words “or for any other reason”.  
     
      
    14 An additional and specific matter is pertinent to the present judgment. The Crown referred to the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Ousley (1996) 87 A Crim R 326 at 339-345, where the Court (Hayne JA, Southwell and Smith AJJA) considered a ground of appeal against conviction arising from a refusal by the trial judge to discharge a juror in circumstances where it was contended the juror was unable to give undivided attention to the trial by reason of pressure being brought to bear upon the juror during the trial by her employer.  
     
      
    15 The decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal was the subject of appeal to the High Court of Australia (Ousley v The Queen [1997] 192 CLR 69) on other grounds. It was submitted to the Victorian Court of Appeal that the trial judge had erred in declining to discharge the relevant juror, with the appellant relying upon statements in Black v The Queen [1993] 179 CLR 44 at 50-51 concerning the fundamental principle that the jury must be free to deliberate without any pressure being brought to bear upon them. In the circumstances of R v Ousley, the Victorian Court of Appeal held (at 344-345) that the trial judge had not erred in the exercise of discretion in declining to discharge the juror who appeared to be under some stress with respect to employment. In that case, the juror stated that she wished to continue to serve as a juror in the trial and indicated that she did not feel that her ability to continue to act as a juror was affected by the employment-related stress (at 341). It remained a matter for the trial judge to determine whether the juror could and would perform her task without being distracted (at 345).  
     
      
    16 As will be seen, considerations of the type referred to in R v Ousley arose in connection with the discharge application by the employment juror. 
     
      
      Events from 13 June 2007 to 5 December 2007  
       
      
    17 It is necessary to place in context the present applications for discharge.  
     
      
    18 The Court and the parties were informed on 4 July 2007 that the pregnant juror was pregnant (MFI24). That juror has continued to serve as a juror and has made no application to be discharged. A request was made for special consideration for medical appointments that needed to be made relating to the pregnancy (MFI24). The present appearance of the juror confirms that her pregnancy is well advanced. 
     
      
    19 After the trial had been underway for some time, the Court received a request on 31 July 2007 from the employment juror to be excused for two days in August 2007 to permit him to undertake a process of assessment for a new position which he regarded, reasonably, as being most important to his professional career path in the industry in which he worked (MFI56; T1578). On 6 August 2007, the employment juror indicated that the assessment process had been deferred and withdrew his request to be excused for those days (MFI64; T1713). On 12 September 2007, the employment juror renewed the application to be excused for the assessment process then scheduled for 17, 18, 19, 22 and 23 October 2007 (MFI94; T3011).  
     
      
    20 Having consulted counsel on the issue, a request was made that the juror seek to reschedule the assessment (MFI95; T3015-3023), but this was not possible (MFI101; T3236 and MFI106; T3299-3300). Having once again consulted counsel, I determined that it was appropriate to excuse the juror for the days requested to allow this process to be undertaken and the juror was so informed (T3332). It was also possible to utilise part of this period for the purpose of another juror who required tear-duct surgery: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 31) at [8].  
     
      
    21 Following the assessment, the employment juror informed the Court by way of a note on 29 October 2007 (MFI118) that he had been successful in the assessment process and was to commence training as part of the employment process on 10 December 2007.  
     
      
    22 The closing addresses of counsel commenced on 9 October 2007 and concluded on 20 November 2007 (with some breaks during that period). The Court heard submissions and made decisions, in the absence of the jury, on 21-23 November 2007 concerning written directions and a chronology to be provided to the jury. My summing up commenced on 26 November 2007 and concluded on 4 December 2007. 
     
      
    23 As the trial progressed, the employment juror furnished notes to the Court indicating concerns which he had with respect to the approaching commencement date of 10 December 2007. On 29 November 2007, the juror provided documentation which demonstrated that he had on 6 November 2007 proposed to his future employer the deferral of the commencement date from 10 December 2007 to 7 January 2008 (MFI149). A complication in this respect was an important personal commitment of the juror in February 2008 which would interrupt a process commencing on 7 January 2008. According to the documentation provided by the juror (MFI149), the employer indicated to the juror on 7 November 2007 that it was not possible to accommodate the request by the juror to reschedule the commencement date to 7 January 2008 as other persons were affected by the commencement date given the nature of the industry involved. The employer indicated to the juror that, if he did not commence as scheduled, then he would be placed on “active hold” and offered a position when it could be confirmed. It seemed to me that the employment juror had made reasonable efforts to defer the commencement date until 7 January 2008.  
     
      
    24 In a note (MFI149) received on 29 November 2007, the employment juror foreshadowed an application to be discharged from the jury if verdicts had not been reached by 4.00 pm on Friday, 7 December 2007. The juror indicated that, following the offer of employment made in late October 2007, he had resigned from his previous employment. He indicated that he had substantial mortgage commitments and that the commencement of employment on 10 December 2007 was critical for financial, as well as personal and professional reasons. Counsel were informed of the position, and I raised with the employment juror the ability of the Sheriff’s Office to make representations to his new employer (MFI149). The juror requested that this not be done as he did not think that it would assist. Given the point that the trial had reached, I accepted this and the Sheriff’s Office were not requested to intervene at that time (MFI150). 
     
      
    25 I raised with the jury the possibility of deliberations continuing, if verdicts had not been reached, on the weekend of 8-9 December 2007. I was informed (MFI159 and MFI163) that two members of the jury had made interstate travel arrangements for that weekend. 
     
      
    26 On 5 December 2007, after the jury had retired to consider its verdicts, I received a further note from the employment juror. He indicated an increased level of stress and concern given the uncertainty surrounding his position (MFI159). Having heard submissions of counsel on the question, I formed the view that a note to the following effect should be handed to the juror (MFI164): 
     
      
       
        
        “Your application is receiving careful consideration by his Honour. 
         
         
        You indicated in an earlier note that you did not wish the Sheriff’s Office to make representations on your behalf to your employer. Given the critical stage which has been reached in the trial, his Honour considers that it is appropriate that the Sheriff’s Office, on behalf of the Court, make active representations to your employer concerning your position. There is a public interest in your continued participation as a member of the jury until the trial is completed and the representations by the Sheriff’s Office would emphasise that factor. Could you please indicate by note by 3.00 pm today the person to whom representations should be made.” 
         
        
       
      
    27 The employment juror requested that his note in reply be provided the next morning.  
     
      
       
      Events on 6 December 2007 
       
      
    28 On 6 December 2007, the pregnant juror did not attend Court and a medical certificate was received certifying her unfitness to attend for jury duties because of pregnancy-related complications from 6 to 9 December 2007 (MFI166). The practical effect of this was that jury deliberations could not continue without the full jury being present. It was in this context that the two applications referred to at [1] above were considered by the Court.  
     
      
    29 On 6 December 2007, the employment juror provided a note (MFI167) which had clearly been typed overnight and before he came to Court and learned that the pregnant juror was not present. The note referred to difficulties if he was required to remain as a juror beyond 7 December 2007, including unemployment, financial and mortgage difficulties and personal difficulties surrounding his important personal commitment in February 2008. The note said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I regard the threat to my future (for the above reasons) so seriously that I have become highly agitated and extremely anxious with these conditions impacting severely upon both my ability to concentrate and my general demeanour inside the jury room and outside in my private life. 
        
       
       
        
        I understand the nature of the public duty associated with the important task that I am performing. 
        
       
       
        
        However, I now believe that my inability to concentrate and my overall emotional state has now placed me in a position where I no longer feel that I have the capacity to properly discharge the very important oath that I took as a juror when this trial commenced on the 13th June 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        On the above basis I must further renew my application to be excused as I can no longer tolerate the above threats to my financial, family professional welfare.” 
        
       
      
    30 In the note, the employment juror acknowledged the offer that the Sheriff’s Office intervene but observed that he did not consider that such representations would assist the position. 
     
      
    31 After hearing counsel, I determined that the Sheriff’s Office should, nevertheless, make urgent representations to the new employer and the employment juror was so informed by note from my Associate (MFI168) which included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour has considered your note dated 5 December 2007 and has requested that I communicate the following to you. 
         
         
        His Honour is conscious of the personal and financial importance to you of this employment opportunity. 
         
         
        However, as stated in my note dated 5 December 2007, his Honour has determined that the Sheriff’s Office ought make representations, on behalf of the Court, directly to your employer in the present exceptional circumstances. The focus of those representations would be to seek deferral of your commencement date until 7 January 2008, but on terms that would allow your other personal requirements in that period to be accommodated. His Honour wishes to emphasise that representations by the Sheriff’s Office would seek to protect, and not prejudice, your interests with respect to this employment. It is the experience of the Court that direct representations by the Sheriff’s Office, on behalf of the Court, may bring about a change in circumstances where those representations relate to the important duty of citizens to perform jury service. 
         
         
        His Honour has requested that the Sheriff’s Office make urgent contact this morning with Mr  
        […] 
        , Resources Planning Co-Ordinator, the person referred to in the emails attached to your note dated 27 November 2007. If appropriate, the representative of the Sheriff’s Office will discuss the position with Mr  
        […] 
        ’s superior or superiors, if that was considered useful in making clear the view of the Court. 
         
         
        His Honour wishes to emphasise that the purposes of these representations being made by the Sheriff’s Office, on behalf of the Court include the public interest in you continuing to serve as a member of the jury and to assist your ability to concentrate on jury deliberations while these representations are being made by the Sheriff’s Office.” 
        
       
      
    32 The Sheriff’s Office made immediate contact with two persons from the relevant company (MFI170). In short, it was confirmed that, if the employment juror did not commence on 10 December 2007, it was not possible to include him in the group commencing on 7 January 2008 (given his leave request for a period in February 2008). It was confirmed that, if the employment juror did not commence on 10 December 2007, he would be placed on a form of eligibility list where there was no certainty of employment commencing and, if it did, such employment would not commence before March 2008. It was made clear that the employer could not alter the arrangements as requested, because of the effect on others and the nature and requirements of the training and induction process of the particular industry. In effect, this confirmed the belief of the employment juror as to the prospects of success of representations.  
     
      
    33 In view of the note from the juror (MFI167) and the responses to the representations by the Sheriff’s Office, the Crown submitted that the appropriate course was to accede to the discharge application by the employment juror with the Court to then direct that the trial continue with a jury of 10 under s.22 of the Act. 
     
      
    34 Mr Sutherland SC submitted that I should discharge the pregnant juror forthwith to allow jury deliberations to continue with the 10 remaining jurors (including the employment juror) constituting the jury under s.22 Jury Act 1977. This would allow deliberations to proceed with the possibility of verdicts before the afternoon of Friday, 7 December 2007.  
     
      
    35 The application by the Accused to discharge the pregnant juror was based upon her temporary absence commencing on 6 December 2007, which had the effect of stopping jury deliberations at a time when the employment juror remained present. Mr Sutherland SC made submissions concerning observations of the degree of attention by the pregnant juror during the course of the trial, contending that there was limited attentiveness on the part of the juror. Mr Sutherland SC accepted, as was obvious, that the juror is well advanced in her pregnancy. During the course of submissions, I stated that my own observations (although not continuous during the course of summing up), were that the pregnant juror had (as with other jurors) been apparently attentive, with occasions when (as with other jurors) there may have been a lesser level of attention. This comment should be understood in the context of the trial. In the course of their lengthy closing addresses to the jury, both counsel had referred on more than one occasion, in an apologetic way, to the demanding nature of the process in which the jury was engaged in this trial. I had sought to ensure that the jury had regular breaks during the trial and, in particular, during closing addresses and the summing up. In the circumstances of the case and given the length of addresses and summing up, it did not seem to me that the level of attentiveness of the pregnant juror or, for that matter, any other juror supported an application for discharge.  
     
      
    36 Mr Sutherland SC raised in submissions the fact that the employment juror had been replaced as foreperson of the jury on 12 November 2007, in circumstances of some apparent personal tension amongst the jurors: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 32). He raised the question whether the pregnant juror might have been the author of notes (MFI130) written on 9 November 2007 to which reference was made by me on 12 November 2007 (T4402-4403) before I made comments to the jury concerning tensions in the jury room (T4404-4407). Later on 12 November 2007, raised voices were heard in Court apparently emanating from the jury room (T4423.11) and soon after a note was received stating that a new foreperson had been selected by the jury (MFI132; T4423-4428). Although it was not known to the Court at the time, I note that these tensions appear to have manifested themselves on 9 November 2007, soon after the employment juror had been informed on 7 November 2007 that there was no prospect of deferring his commencement to 7 January 2008 (see [23] above). I should observe that the pregnant juror was not the author of the notes which related to personal tensions in the jury room (MFI130).  
     
      
    37 I raised with Mr Sutherland SC what would occur if the pregnant juror was discharged and no verdicts were returned with the question then arising, on the afternoon of 7 December 2007, whether the employment juror should be discharged, with the prospect that the jury may be reduced to nine members.  
     
      
    38 In this regard, the Crown submitted that there was a question as to whether a jury trial for offences against the law of the Commonwealth could proceed under s.22(a)(iii) Jury Act 1977 with a jury of nine persons in light of an observation by Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne in Brownlee v The Queen at 304 [73]. In effect, the Crown submitted that no proper basis had been demonstrated for the discharge of the pregnant juror and, if that course was adopted, a question may arise if the employment juror sought to be discharged, involving the prospect of the trial proceeding with a jury of nine. 
     
      
    39 Having heard the submissions of counsel, I left the bench for a short period to consider the applications. In that period, I received a handwritten note from the employment juror (MFI169) in the following terms (the identity of the employer is omitted): 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not agree with or condone what you are doing. You are going against what I have put to you and is now at a point of being unreasonable. 
        
       
       
        
        From this point on - any detriment to any aspect of the issues and concerns relating to real situations that I have outlined to you in all previous correspondence that arise as a direct result of your directions, I will have no other option - other than to take advice to protect my position and ultimately - welfare. 
        
       
       
        
        How you intend to have all of my interests covered by a company (…) that I’m not currently employed by - is beyond me. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst his Honour wishes to emphasise the purpose of these representations made by the Sheriff’s Office are to assist me in being able to concentrate on deliberations, I can confirm that at this particular point in the trial, this is most certainly  
        not 
         the case. 
        
       
       
        
        Your position is now causing a feeling of hostility within and is far from causing me to feel at ease let alone concentrate. 
        
       
       
        
        My levels of tension, anxiety and stress are now at such levels that I am concerned that my personal health is put at risk.” 
        
       
      
    40 I informed counsel of the contents of this note. The Crown submitted that it strengthened the submission that the employment juror should be discharged. Mr Sutherland SC had no further submission in light of the note, indicating that it was a matter for the Court. 
     
      
       
      Determination of Discharge and s.22 Continuation Applications 
       
      
    41 The receipt of the note (MFI169) fortified my view that the employment juror should be discharged forthwith and that the trial ought proceed under s.22 with a jury of 10, including the pregnant juror given that, according to the medical certificate (MFI166), she would be fit to resume jury duties on 10 December 2007. 
     
      
    42 I took the view that the fundamental issue on 6 December 2007 was the discharge application by the employment juror. In reality, whether the pregnant juror was present or not on that day, the employment juror stated that he was under such stress (which could not be alleviated) that he could no longer continue to deliberate. If deliberations had been able to continue, the proper conclusion was that the deliberations would have been affected by pressure, as a result of stresses upon the employment juror. 
     
      
    43 In my view, no basis was demonstrated for the discharge of the pregnant juror who was temporarily absent but to return on 10 December 2007. In my view, the pregnant juror was seeking to discharge her duty as a juror. She had made no application to be discharged from the jury upon the basis of her pregnancy. 
     
      
    44 I reached a different conclusion with respect to the application by the employment juror. It was clear to me that the juror was under a considerable level of stress, well illustrated in his final note (MFI169) set out at [39] above. If, contrary to his wishes, the employment juror was required to remain on the jury for the purpose of deliberations to take place on 6 and 7 December 2007, his level of stress was such that pressure would be placed upon himself and the other members of the jury, to reach verdicts within the time limit identified by the employment juror. This would give rise to the difficulties considered by the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Ousley. 
     
      
    45 The employment juror no longer wished to serve as a juror in the trial. There was no doubt that he was under a great deal of pressure which was affecting his ability to deliberate as a juror. The employment juror’s application on 5 December 2007 had been, in effect, that I guarantee that he be discharged on the afternoon of 7 December 2007 if verdicts had not been reached by then. I was not prepared to give the juror such an assurance. Even if I had given him such an assurance, the tenor of the employment juror’s latest notes suggested that he did not, at that time, consider himself to be in a fit state to continue deliberations. Deliberations could have continued on 6 December 2007 only if I had discharged the pregnant juror, leaving a jury of 10. If verdicts had not been reached on 7 December 2007 and the employment juror was discharged, then the issue arising from Brownlee v The Queen concerning continuation of a trial with a jury of nine in a Commonwealth prosecution would have arisen for consideration.  
     
      
    46 In all the circumstances, I formed the view that the appropriate course was to discharge the employment juror. In reaching this conclusion, I took into account the employment juror’s statements as to his state of mind and his inability to continue to deliberate in an undistracted way. I was satisfied that the employment juror could not and would not perform his task without being distracted. I was satisfied that the juror’s level of distraction would dominate his thinking during deliberations. 
     
      
    47 I should mention that I raised with counsel the question whether s.69 Jury Act 1977 had application in the circumstances of the employment juror. Counsel did not submit that the provision had any application to these circumstances of future employment, and I accepted that view.  
     
      
    48 It was for these reasons that I formed the clear view that the employment juror ought be discharged from the jury. 
     
      
    49 Having reached that view, the second and separate step, referred to at [10] above, arose for consideration as to whether the trial ought continue with a jury of 10. Given the point that has been reached in the trial and the history of the proceedings, I formed the view that this was the appropriate course and that the trial ought proceed with a jury of 10 in accordance with s.22 of the Act. In R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 27) at [17], I observed that trial before a jury of 12 persons is the statutory ideal, but that the ideal may be departed from by operation of s.22 of the Act. The whole purpose of s.22 is to provide that a trial can proceed before a jury despite the discharge of one or more of its members. There can be a fair and lawful trial of an accused person despite the discharge of a juror or jurors in the course of the proceedings: Wu v The Queen at 106-107 [21]. Considerations of this type led me to the same conclusion on this application as I had reached on the earlier application on 2 August 2007. 
     
      
    50 In this respect, I note that Mr Sutherland SC had urged me to continue the trial with a jury of 10 under s.22 of the Act if I acceded to his application to discharge the pregnant juror. 
     
      
      Application to Discharge the Jury 
       
      
    51 After stating my orders on 6 December 2007, Mr Sutherland SC made application to discharge the jury of 10, and to abort the trial, because of dislocation of the trial flowing from the four-day break in deliberations which would occur between 6 and 10 December 2007. The Crown opposed the discharge application. 
     
      
    52 I declined the application to discharge the jury. The trial has been a lengthy one and has reached a point where members of the jury have retired to consider their verdicts. I did not consider that a break in deliberations of four days (including a weekend) provides a proper basis, in the exercise of discretion, to discharge the jury and abort the trial. 
     
      
    53 In this respect, I had regard once again to factors which bore upon the s.22 continuation decision. These factors included the interests of the Accused and the community in verdicts being reached and the history of the proceedings involving two earlier trials (in 2005 and 2007) where juries were discharged without verdict. In these circumstances, I determined that the proper course was to keep the trial on foot with a jury of 10 continuing to deliberate for the purpose of reaching verdicts. That process would resume at 9.30 am on 10 December 2007. An order was made under s.54(1)(b) Jury Act 1977 permitting the jury to separate until that time. 
     
      
    54 It was for these reasons that I made orders as announced on 6 December 2007.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: At about 4am on 11 January 2005 the deceased Ric Anson was shot to death in the bedroom of his home. The offenders Owen Frazer, William Spencer and a third man, Kirrlie Wilson, were charged with his murder. On 22 November a jury convicted Wilson of murder and the offenders Frazer and Spencer of manslaughter. 
     
      
    2 The Crown case was that the deceased was intentionally shot during the course of an armed robbery committed by Frazer and Wilson at the instigation of Spencer. The defence case was that the deceased was accidentally shot during a drug supply transaction between Wilson and the deceased organised by Spencer. Each of the offenders gave evidence in support of that defence. It is obvious from the jury’s verdicts that they rejected those accounts. On the issues raised during the trial and in light of the verdicts, there is in my mind no doubt as to the factual basis upon which the offenders are to be sentenced. It is as follows. 
     
      
    3 At the time of the killing, the offender Spencer and his girlfriend Hazel Seery had been living with the deceased at a residential townhouse in Toronto for about one month. Also residing there was a woman named Caroline Puru. Spencer, Ms Seery and the deceased were all users of amphetamine. 
     
      
    4 A couple of days before his death the deceased borrowed money from Spencer in order to pay for a hire car for the purpose of travelling to Queensland where he carried out an armed robbery. He returned on 10 January 2005 in possession of a large sum of money. He met up with Spencer on the Central Coast where the money borrowed was repaid. Shortly thereafter, Mr Spencer told Ms Seery in effect that the deceased was going to be assaulted and robbed of the money he had stolen. 
     
      
    5 For this purpose, Spencer contacted Wilson who sought the assistance of Mr Frazer. The plan was that Spencer was going to arrange for the other two offenders to gain entry into the deceased’s premises during the early hours of 11 January. Although Ms Seery argued with Spencer about the plan because of her close relationship with the deceased, she did not inform him of what was going to happen. 
     
      
    6 On the night of 10 January, Spencer, Ms Seery, Ms Puru and the deceased were at home in Toronto. The deceased was in possession of a handgun, which he was waving around. He appeared to be affected by drugs and paranoid. Spencer asked Ms Seery to help get Ms Puru out of the house because he did not want her to get “slapped around or hurt” during the course of the robbery. Accordingly, Ms Seery persuaded Ms Puru to accompany her and Spencer to the Central Coast, leaving the deceased alone at the Toronto residence. Initially, Ms Puru did not wish to leave the deceased alone. However, he said to Ms Puru, “I’ll be all right. Trust me. I’ve got this here with me,” referring to the handgun. It is clear that at some stage Spencer informed Wilson that the deceased was armed and in a dangerous mood. 
     
      
    7 Spencer, Ms Seery and Ms Puru then travelled to the Central Coast in Ms Seery’s car where they stayed for a period of time and ingested amphetamine. Early in the morning of 11 January 2005 Spencer contacted an associate, Michael Mitchell, and, on the pretext that Ms Seery’s vehicle had broken down, asked him to drive them to the deceased’s home, ostensibly to gather clothing because Ms Seery had fallen out with the deceased. 
     
      
    8 In the meantime, the offender Wilson had arrived at the residence of Mr Sales, his nephew. He asked Mr Sales to give him a lift in order to obtain some drugs. They then drove to the offender Frazer’s residence at Gwandalan. At the time Frazer was living there alone with his children as his wife was in hospital. Frazer expressed some reluctance to go with them. Wilson said to Frazer, “Oh it’s all right, mate. Everything will be fine. Just get ready and come on.” Mr Sales then drove Wilson and Frazer to Lake Munmorah, where they met with Spencer who had arrived there with Ms Seery. 
     
      
    9 After a short conversation between the offenders, they made their way to Toronto, Spencer in Mr Mitchell’s vehicle accompanied by Ms Seery, and Wilson and Frazer in the vehicle driven by Mr Sales. Spencer was in constant contact with Wilson by mobile telephone giving him directions that Wilson passed on to Mr Sales. 
     
      
    10 On the way to Toronto Mr Mitchell heard Spencer speaking on his mobile telephone. At one time he heard him say something about “doing the job right” and making sure that it was done properly. Mr Mitchell asked what this was about and Spencer said he had to get money off some guy and “had to smash someone for money”. 
     
      
    11 The vehicle driven by Mr Sales arrived at the street in Toronto first. He parked on the side of the road and waited for the other vehicle. When Spencer arrived near the deceased’s residence, he left Mr Mitchell’s vehicle and went to the deceased’s townhouse where he opened the door leaving it ajar so that Wilson and Frazer could enter to carry out the robbery. Spencer then had a short conversation with his co-offenders before re-entering Mr Mitchell’s vehicle and telling him to leave. 
     
      
    12 Wilson and Frazer entered the deceased’s residence where they stayed for about ten minutes. Mr Sales then heard two gunshots in short succession emanating from the direction of the townhouse. Wilson and Frazer then returned to Mr Sales’ car. The offender Wilson said to Frazer, “I’m sorry, Owen. I fucked up. I’m so sorry.” He repeated this several times. Wilson then directed Mr Sales to drive back in the direction from which they had come. Spencer telephoned a short time later and they arranged to meet at Rathmines golf course. 
     
      
    13 Mr Mitchell drove Spencer and Ms Seery to a nearby service station where Mr Mitchell purchased petrol. This was at about 4am. Spencer then instructed Mr Mitchell to drive back past the deceased’s residence before proceeding back to the Central Coast. Mr Sales’ vehicle was no longer to be seen. 
     
      
    14 On the return journey to the Central Coast, Spencer told Mr Mitchell to stop at the corner of the Rathmines golf course in order to meet with a person in another vehicle who had his mobile phone. Mr Mitchell stopped his car behind Mr Sales’ vehicle. Spencer alighted and went to the passenger window of the vehicle where he spoke to the offender Wilson. Spencer said to Wilson, “Did you get it?”, and Wilson replied, “No. It’s too early in the morning. We’re not worrying about it.” Spencer said, “Oh well, that’s all right,” and returned to Mr Mitchell’s, where he said to Ms Seery, “The gutless cunts, they didn’t do it.” 
     
      
    15 Mr Mitchell then drove Spencer and Ms Seery back to Blue Haven where they left him, before picking up Ms Puru and returning to the deceased’s residence in Ms Seery’s vehicle. They arrived back at the deceased’s home at about 6.30am. Mr Sales drove back to Frazer’s residence, where Wilson and Frazer remained. 
     
      
    16 Upon returning to the deceased’s residence, the front door was found to be ajar. The offender Spencer, Ms Seery and Ms Puru went inside, calling out the deceased’s name. Ms Puru went upstairs and found the deceased lying dead across his bed. She called out to Spencer, who came upstairs. He suggested that they search the house to remove anything they did not want the police to find. 
     
      
    17 Three and a half grams of amphetamine were located in the fridge. They then left the townhouse and drove to the home of Ms Puru’s mother. On the way Ms Puru hid the amphetamine in bushland. Ms Puru’s mother subsequently drove the offender Spencer along with Ms Seery and Ms Puru to Toronto police station where they reported finding the body of the deceased. 
     
      
    18 The evidence of Dr Lee, the forensic pathologist, was that the deceased was shot to the head just above the left eyebrow. There was an exit wound also to the front of the head caused by a piece of shrapnel from the bullet. The deceased had other injuries that were consistent with him having been pistol-whipped to the head and he had defence wounds to the back of his arms. He was shot while he was sitting on the bed facing the shooter and probably as he fell backwards to a prone position. There had been another shot that had gone through a window in the bedroom and fired from the same position as the shot that killed the deceased. 
     
      
    19 A firearm, being a cut-down rifle, was located in the garage when police later searched the premises but this was not the weapon used to shoot the deceased. If that weapon was not the weapon that the deceased had been brandishing earlier in the evening before his death, there is no evidence as to what happened to that weapon. The jury’s verdict means that either Wilson or Frazer took a loaded firearm with them into the house and that was the firearm used to shoot the deceased. It was taken with them when they left the premises. 
     
      
    20 The facts I find beyond reasonable doubt are as follows. For whatever reason, it was Spencer who organised the robbery of the deceased so far as the three offenders are concerned, and I believe he planned it. He contacted Wilson and warned him of the danger presented by the deceased and advised him to arm himself. Wilson did so and recruited Frazer to assist him. The offender Frazer was initially reluctant to go with him but agreed to do so, presumably because he hoped to be rewarded. Wilson sought the assistance of Mr Sales, telling him that he was involved in a drug transaction. In the meantime, Spencer organised the services of Mr Mitchell in order to avoid using a vehicle that might be recognised by residents of the street. Spencer rendezvoused with the others outside the deceased’s premises in order to give them access to the townhouse. 
     
      
    21 Frazer and Wilson entered the premises, Frazer being there to assist Wilson in either intimidating the deceased or to prevent his escape. Wilson assaulted the deceased with a weapon he had brought with him, probably while the deceased was sitting on the bed. In the course of that assault, Wilson discharged the weapon, intending to kill the deceased, I assume because he lost his temper when the deceased refused to co-operate. When Frazer and Wilson left the premises, Wilson apologised to Frazer for having shot the deceased. Spencer met with them later in order to get the proceeds of the robbery. 
     
      
    22 This was an armed robbery that went wrong. When they entered the deceased’s premises they did not intend to kill him but only to threaten and assault him with the weapon that was brought. It was loaded in case the deceased was himself armed and they needed to protect themselves. The verdict of manslaughter against Frazer is on the basis that he was present at the premises participating in a robbery. I believe that he knew that Wilson had a weapon with him at the time but he did not foresee that Wilson might intentionally shoot the deceased during the robbery. The verdict of manslaughter against Spencer is on the basis that, although he set up the robbery and contemplated that it would involve a loaded firearm, he did not foresee that it might be discharged with the necessary intent. 
     
      
    23 The manslaughter offence committed by both the offenders Frazer and Spencer was of a most serious kind because it was committed in circumstances where the offenders were engaged in a common criminal enterprise to rob the deceased in his own home in the early hours of the morning when he would be most vulnerable. They both at least contemplated that Wilson might be armed with a loaded weapon and that it might be discharged resulting in the death of the deceased. In fact I am satisfied that both offenders knew that Wilson would be armed simply by reason of the threat posed by the deceased who himself had been armed earlier that night. I reject the possibility that Wilson might have armed himself yet not been told to do so by Spencer or without Frazer being aware of that fact. This was a case where the criminal conduct engaged by the offenders was itself very grave even if there had been no killing. 
     
      
    24 During the course of submissions I raised with counsel the question of the relevance, if any, of the standard non-parole period applicable to an offence under s 112(3) of the Crimes Act. Of course, neither offender had been charged or convicted of that offence but it was accepted that the facts proved against them amounted to such a offence. Having given the matter considerably more thought, I do not believe I should take it into account in any way. There are such anomalies in the standard non-parole period provisions that they should be limited to cases where they do have direct application. However this does not mean that the criminality of the conduct of which the offenders were involved when the killing occurred is not of very great significance. Even had the deceased not been killed, the activity of the offenders would have warranted a significant gaol sentence regardless of the standard non-parole provisions. 
     
      
    25 Of course it was not a mitigating factor that the deceased was himself a dangerous criminal and that the money to be stolen was itself illegally obtained by the deceased. The criminal law does not discriminate between unlawful homicides on the basis of the effect upon the community of the death of the victim. It acts on the understanding that all life is precious and the taking of human life is of the greatest seriousness regardless of the identity of the victim or the impact of the death on others. There was no victim impact statement tendered before me, but that does not mean that the deceased’s life was of little worth. 
     
      
    26 Offender Frazer is aged fifty-two years. He has been in a very long term relationship from which there are seven children ranging in age from eighteen years to eighteen months. His partner, Ms Montgomery, gave evidence before me. She suffers bouts of illness that frequently require her to be hospitalised. In fact she was in hospital when the offender decided to accompany Mr Wilson. The offender has not been in employment for about seven years because of a shoulder injury. He spent most of his time before his arrest assisting in the care of the children. After his arrest, three of the children were placed in care for a period of about twelve months, presumably because of the inability of Ms Montgomery to cope. She keeps in contact with the offender and visits him when she is able to do so. His incarceration will cause considerable difficulties for Ms Montgomery but the situation is, in my view, not exceptional. I feel very sorry for Ms Montgomery but that cannot be reflected in the sentence to be imposed upon the offender, so serious was his conduct and in such disregard for the welfare of his children. 
     
      
    27 He has a criminal record of little relevance, except that in 1987 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for robbery. However, that was his last criminal conviction. He is entitled to what leniency I can show him from the fact that for almost twenty years he has apparently lived as a law abiding citizen helping to care for his large family. This fact makes it difficult to understand why he determined to leave his children alone in the middle of the night to assist Wilson. As I have indicated already, I must assume he was to receive some of the proceeds of the robbery. 
     
      
    28 Offender Spencer is aged thirty-seven. His mother gave evidence before me. She has remarried and lives in the State’s far north coast where she cares for the offender’s five year old son. The offender is one of eight children and belongs to a close family. His mother took the children and fled from her first marriage because of the abuse suffered by the family at the hands of her first husband. The offender has frequent contact with his mother and child despite being in gaol for the last three years. He has been involved in the use of illegal drugs since the age of seventeen and was addicted to amphetamine at the time of the killing of the deceased. His drug addiction increased after the death of his sister in 1995. The offender has suffered from bouts of depression and twice attempted to take his own life. His mother is hopeful that when the offender is ultimately released from custody he will come to live with her and his son. He has promised her to make changes to his lifestyle. I am full of admiration for his mother but again that cannot be turned simply into mitigation for her son. 
     
      
    29 The offender has an extensive criminal record with numerous sentences of imprisonment imposed upon him. Defence counsel calculated that the offender has spent eleven of the last nineteen years in gaol. He first appeared in the Children’s Court in 1987 and the District Court in 1989. He was first sentenced to a term of imprisonment in 1990. Chiefly his offending has been for matters of dishonesty. There are offences for which he was imprisoned in Victoria in 1995. He was last sentenced to imprisonment in May 2005 for offences of dishonesty and has been in continuous custody since that time. 
     
      
    30 There is a psychological report in evidence. It gives the background of the offender, the significant part of which I have already summarised. He has rarely been in employment except for isolated labouring work. He has come under psychiatric care, mainly it appears as a result of experiencing drug-induced psychosis as evidenced in the report of Dr Darcy. He has sought little or no treatment for his addiction. There is some suggestion of an organic brain disorder but this has not been investigated. The psychologist opines that the offender’s judgment was impaired at the time of offending but does not deign to indicate how that might have had any effect upon his criminal culpability in being involved in a planned armed robbery for which he was largely instrumental. He noted that the offender appears genuine in his wish now to seek rehabilitation but I give that opinion no weight in the absence of evidence from the offender and in light of his frequent offending. The psychologist does not explain why he formed that view unless it was intuitive. 
     
      
    31 I accept as is almost inevitably the case that Mr Spencer has matters in his background that have led to his abuse of illegal drugs. The psychologist refers to him self-medicating, but that is not a matter of significant mitigation. Certainly not at the age of thirty-seven, and with the attitude Mr Spencer has shown so far to reform. Unfortunately it is almost inevitably the case that persons who abuse drugs over the period and to the extent that the offender has had very severe personality disorders often caused by problems in early life that were not their fault. There are very often traumatic incidents that have exacerbated their problems. Very rarely will an understanding of the dynamics of the drug dependency have any significant relevance to a court sentencing a repeat offender for a very serious offence. So it is in the case of Mr Spencer. To a degree one can sympathise with his situation but unfortunately there is little room to reduce his sentence. 
     
      
    32 As I indicated to Mr Spencer’s counsel during addresses, if the death of the deceased, a person the offender acknowledged as a friend, has not led to Mr Spencer taking stock of his life and his abuse of drugs, nothing I can do or say will have that effect. There is a substantial bond with his son, and it may be as his mother hopes, that this might be his eventual salvation. However his conduct was, in my opinion, more serious than that of Mr Frazer. If he did not organise the robbery at the outset, and I believe that he did, he was instrumental in putting it into effect in a very significant way. He encouraged Ms Seery to get Ms Puru out of the premises, and more significantly, he used keys entrusted to him by the deceased to let in Frazer and Wilson. Contrary to submissions made on his behalf, this was a significant breach of trust whether falling within s21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act or at common law. 
     
      
    33 I accept that Mr Spencer was emotionally upset over the death of the deceased, no doubt because to a very substantial degree he was responsible for it. There might be remorse over the killing but none over the offence that led to it. The same is the case with Mr Frazer. The lack of contrition for committing a serious offence involving the planned armed robbery in a private home does not auger well for the rehabilitation of either offender. Remorse otherwise has limited mitigatory value on its own. 
     
      
    34 Mr Spencer has been held on protection during the three years that he has been in prison since last sentenced. His protection is a result of fears he held for himself by reason of earlier difficulties with members of the prison population. His protection is completely unrelated to this offence. 
     
      
    35 Counsel raised with me in submissions the fact that Mr Spencer was held on protection and asked me to take that into account. Having referred here to cases such as Mostyn (2004) 145 A Crim R 304 and Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, I allowed him to seek further material from the Department of Corrective Services to indicate the nature of Mr Spencer’s protection, and more significantly whether it can be said that he would serve or has served his gaol sentence in more harsher conditions such that I should take into account to reduce his sentence for even such a serious offence. 
     
      
    36 Information handed up today indicates that little impact has occurred by reason of Mr Spencer’s seeking protection. As is so often now the case, Corrective Services are able to provide protection to prisoners and yet afford them the opportunities such as they are that other inmates of prisons have and can benefit from. It seems to me in line with recent authority that I cannot reduce Mr Spencer’s sentence by reason of him being on protection as it does not seem to me that he has served his sentence in the past or will serve in the future in harsher conditions that warrants a reduction in his sentence. 
     
      
    37 The circumstances of the offending require that a very significant factor of general deterrence be reflected in the sentence. This is not a factor always present in manslaughter cases but here it is warranted by the circumstances leading up to the killing and particularly the use of a loaded firearm of which both offenders were aware. The use of violence is not itself an aggravating factor in manslaughter cases that inevitably involve some degree of personal violence except in the very rare negligence cases. Here the degree of violence contemplated was not exceptional. However, it was a matter of aggravation that the offence involved the use of firearm. I make it plain of course that neither offender is punished in any way for giving what the jury found to be false evidence. 
     
      
    38 The maximum penalty for the offence is twenty-five years imprisonment. It is the greatest maximum penalty imposed for offences under the Crimes Act short of life. There is no standard non-parole period. It is trite that it is almost impossible to identify a range of sentences for manslaughter offences nor is it helpful to classify them according to their nature or legal basis. It is not particularly helpful to compare and contrast sentences imposed in different cases so varied are the facts giving rise to the offence. However I was referred to a number of sentencing decisions that might provide some assistance at least so far as consistency in sentencing is important. 
     
      
    39 In Charman, Hulme J started with a sentence of ten years before applying a discount for the utilitarian value of a plea and assistance. That was the case of a killing arising the course of a planned break and enter offence where the occupant was going to be knocked unconscious. Unfortunately he was struck too hard, killing him. The offender was the driver of the getaway vehicle and was aged about twenty years and had no significant criminal record although he was subject to a bond at the time. This was not, in my opinion, as serious as the offence before me, not the least because it did not involve the use of a firearm. The subjective circumstances of that offender also warranted a reduced sentence. In my opinion, these same observations apply to the case of Dang [2001] NSWCCA 321 the Court of Criminal Appeal and the sentence imposed by me in Denton [2001] NSWSC 850. 
     
      
    40 I believe that the manslaughter here is as serious as it could be save for the fact that the offenders are not professional robbers. By that I mean as serious as an offence of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter can be. As I indicated in the course of submissions, I believe there has been an increase in sentences for manslaughter in more recent times, perhaps not for unlawful and dangerous act manslaughters to the same degree, having regard to the cases presented to me. I find it difficult, having regard to the range of sentences imposed in other somewhat similar cases, to mark sufficiently the distinction between committing an offence of armed robbery in the circumstance of this case and where the same acts are done, but resulting in the death of the householder. 
     
      
    41 As against a maximum penalty of twenty-five years I would have imposed a sentence on the offender Spencer of at least fifteen years and on Frazer a sentence of at least thirteen years. But I feel constrained by the pattern of sentencing to reduce it to a point that may be considered by some members of the public as too low. It is not for me to attempt to increase the tariff. If that is to be achieved it must fall to the Court of Criminal Appeal and will necessitate a review of sentencing generally for murder, felony murder and the various categories of manslaughter. Still it must be borne in mind by those who contemplate the sentence to be imposed upon the offenders that they were not convicted of murder. Further, this is not a manslaughter where there was an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm or death. Clearly, the more serious offences of manslaughter have this as an ingredient. 
     
      
    42 In the case of the offender Spencer, there are special circumstances and the fact that the sentence I am imposing is cumulative to sentences he was serving for unrelated offences. Overall he will have a total sentence of fourteen years and I intend to bring about the result that generally speaking the non-parole period for the manslaughter represents the application of the statutory ratio to the total sentence he is to serve. In my view there is no other reason to reduce the non-parole period.  
     
      
    43 In the case of Mr Frazer, there are special circumstances only in the fact that at age fifty-one he will serve his first sentence in twenty years and it will be a lengthy one. He will need longer on supervision in order to readjust back into the community. But there is a minimum period he must spend to reflect the seriousness of his crime and therefore there can only be a small reduction to the non-parole period. The difference in the sentences between the offenders is intended to reflect both that the offender Spencer had greater culpability in the commission of the offence and his worse criminal record. 
     
      
    44 The offender Spencer is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of thirteen years made up of a non-parole period of nine and a half years with a balance of term of three and a half years. The sentence is to date from 19 May 2006 and the non-parole period expires on 18 November 2015. That is the date upon which he will first be eligible to release to parole. 
     
      
    45 The offender Frazer is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eleven years made up of a non-parole period of seven and a half years with a balance of term of three and a half years. The sentence is to date from 19 May 2006 and the non-parole period expires on 18 November 2013. That is the date upon which Mr Frazer will be eligible for release to parole. 
     
      
    46 Mr O’Sullivan, Mr Austin, if I have got the figures wrong, let me know and I will come back on and adjust them. You can see what I intended to bring about. Before I adjourn can I compliment Mr O’Sullivan and Mr Austin on the way the trial was conducted.

   JUDGMENT 1. The three young men sitting in the dock, each has been imprisoned now for several months. Each has a bearing and carriage suggesting he is confident, assured, manly and competent. Each has an appearance of fitness reminiscent of an elite athlete. As each sits in the dock, each could present as an advertisement of the glow of youth. As each sits in the dock one could be excused for thinking each would be the source of pride and joy to his family. 2. However the behaviour of each on the night of 10 November 2006 was such as to disgrace each. It went well beyond what was tolerable. It descended to what was criminal. It also descended to what was cowardly. 3. The Court has been told each was drunk. A moment's thought will bring a realisation that alcohol is not the cause of offending. Many, many men drink as much, perhaps more, than these young men did but still do not stoop to this behaviour exhibiting the level of violence these men displayed on 10 November last. It is easy to blame the grog. It relieves one of failing to look at himself or herself and the failure to look for the real explanation. Why did these offenders behave like this when they were drunk, when most drunk men do not behave like this? 4. Shane Bertram, Frank Robinson and Phillip Robinson have each pleaded guilty in Court to the assault occasioning actual bodily harm of Ivan Mandic aged thirty- five and to the assault of Alan Dews whilst each offender was in the company of their co-offenders. Today each is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct as reflected in each of these offences. 5. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for these two offences before this court committed by these three offenders harming these two victims in this community. [ R v Gladue (1999) 1SCR 688 [80]]. 6. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the two offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to each offender, subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender. 7. My fact-finding task has been circumscribed in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient if I remind the Court a judge is not party to the agreed set of facts. The tender of the agreed set of facts does not relieve the judge from his or her fact-finding task; it simply limits the material on which the facts may be found. To the extent, if it be the case, the facts as agreed do not reflect the actual events that occurred, it must be remembered the facts can only be found from the evidence before the Court. 8. Each offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found or fixed terms are to be imposed and finally the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. None of this can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight then needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as it’s primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined, see R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740 and R v Rushby (1977) NSWLR 597.Facts9. At about 1.10am on Friday morning 10 November these three offenders entered the Hotel Parramatta located in Darcy Street. A security officer, Ivan Mandic, aged thirty­five, was on duty, standing in the front bar area of the hotel. He observed the offenders entering, approached them asking for identification. His request was ignored by each. They walked down the stairs to the lower level of the hotel. Mandic recognised two of the offenders as persons previously banned from the hotel. He also came to a view that all were intoxicated. Mandic approached the offenders and informed them that they were intoxicated and that they (sic) were banned from the hotel. The offenders were requested to leave the premises by him. They walked up the stairs towards the front door of the hotel. As they approached the front door, yet still inside the hotel, one of the Robinson brothers said, “You motherfucker, you stupid Russian, what’s your problem, what do you have against my cousin”. As this was said that Robinson person pointed to Bertram. The security officer replied, “Guys, just go, just go”. The offenders continued to abuse Mandic and questioned their ejection from the premises. One offender was mimicking Mandic’s accent. 10. At or about the footpath entrance of the hotel both Mandic and offenders continued to abuse each other. One of the offenders commenced to re-enter the premises and was pushed outside again. While the argument continued Miss Karen Manning, the bar manager, endeavoured to come between Mandic and the offenders saying words to the effect of, “Ivan, you walk away”. That remark was addressed to Mandic, and “You guys go”, that remark was addressed to the offenders. She then observed spittle flying towards the offenders, which had come from the direction of Mandic. One or more than one of the offenders said words to the effect of, “You fucking spat at us”. No one else was in the immediate vicinity. 11. The offenders continued to accuse Mandic of spitting at them and they re-entered the hotel. The three offenders commenced to punch Mandic on numerous occasions to the head and body. Mandic picked up a bar stool to protect himself and place distance between himself and the offenders. The offenders, now five metres away, picked up bar stools and threw them at Mandic although none struck him. Mandic dropped the stool from his hands and moved away from the offenders. Meanwhile Miss Manning called out to a female employee for the police to be contacted. 12. The three offenders then left the hotel. They stood near the entrance on a footpath. They abused and threatened the security officer but remained on the footpath for about a minute until they walked in a westerly direction along Darcy Street towards the Church Street Mall. The security officer continued to observe them from the front door of the hotel. They stood outside Hungry Jacks restaurant located on the corner of Darcy and the Church Street Mall for some five minutes. 13. They then walked along Church Street Mall and approached Alan Dews sitting on a bench opposite Christopher’s jewellery store. Bertram tapped Dews on his right shoulder asking for a cigarette. Phillip Robinson and Frank Robinson stood behind Bertram. Upon his shoulder being tapped Dews removed a set of headphones he was wearing and Bertram repeated, “You got a spare smoke buddy?” Dews replied, “Smokes don’t come in spares, champion, they come in packs”. Bertram’s response was to kick Dews to the right side of his head. Frank Robinson approached Dews and requested a cigarette. Dews handed Robinson the cigarette he was then smoking. One of the offenders then demanded more cigarettes. Dews replied he did not have any more. 14. Dews was then kicked to the right side of his face by one of the Robinson boys. Dews then placed both his hands in front of his face hoping to protect himself. Robinson picked up Dews and threw him back into the bench he had been sitting on. Dews reacted by jumping up and grabbing Bertram and pushing him to the ground. As Dews lay on top of Bertram the Robinson brothers began to kick and punch Dews to the upper body and head. Moments later Dews was able to stand. As soon as he stood he felt one of the offenders strike him in the middle of the back with his own skateboard. He fell face to the ground. He then heard his skateboard and something else drop to the ground. That something else turned out to be his backpack. Dews attempted to stand, he saw his mobile phone in the possession of one of the Robinson brothers. He requested the return of the phone and it was returned to him. The Robinsons then walked in a northerly direction along Church Street Mall. 15. Bertram approached Dews and said, “You’re lucky I’m a nice guy, I could have stomped your head in but I decided to let you live and you are lucky you are a small weak cunt”. Bertram then walked in the same direction as the Robinsons. Dews walked towards the Parramatta Hotel. On arriving at the hotel he was seen to be bleeding from his left ear. Some time later police arrived. Dews provided them with a description of the incident and a description of the offenders. 16. Shortly after police were patrolling Church Street Mall and they observed the offenders again outside Hungry Jacks. Police spoke to them and as they did so Dews approached and identified the three persons as being responsible for the assault upon him. They were arrested and conveyed to Parramatta Police Station. 17. During an electronic interview Frank Robinson admitted to being in the company of the co-offenders and involved in the incident at Hotel Parramatta. Phillip Robinson admitted being in the company of the co­offenders and involved in the incident inside the Hotel Parramatta including arming himself with a bar stool and throwing it. In his interview Phillip Robinson implicated the others as having assaulted Dews in Church Street Mall. Bertram declined to be interviewed as was his right and nothing adverse will be held against him for that. Police outlined the allegations to him. He conceded he had been at the Hotel Parramatta with the co­offenders but denied assaulting anyone. 18. As a consequence of the assault Mandic suffered soreness and swelling to the back of his head, pain to his left cheek, pain between his left ring finger and little finger, pain to the right side, hand lower back. 19. Alan Dews as a consequence of the assault suffered soreness to his back, left knee, head and ribs. He also suffered a cut or an abrasion to his left ear. 20. During the interaction with Mandic I am satisfied each offender sought with his aggression to comfort and support his co-offenders. The facts do not specify who struck Mandic where or who threw the chairs at him other than the admission I have just referred to. Each offender in comfort and supporting his co-offender in attack upon Mandic was aligned in a common purpose with the other. 21. During submission Mr Vertigan, solicitor for Bertram, sought to distinguish Bertram’s role from the other two arguing the evidence did not establish his involvement in any assault the others undertook to rescue him from Dews who had jumped upon him. Further he claimed the use of the skateboard as a weapon to strike Dews could not be sheeted home to his client’s criminality. There is no reason to think the common purpose did not encompass some forethought of at least the possibility that one of their number would at some stage be in more strife that he could handle and that the other two would have to come that offender’s rescue. 22. The earlier episode against Mandic demonstrated use of wooden weapons was well within the contemplation of the offenders. Given the closeness of the two incidents there is nothing to suggest a change of attitude by his client when the only weapon apparently available was the skateboard. I am satisfied each offender shares joint responsibility for the striking of Alan Dews with the skateboard. Objective Criminality.23. These assaults constitute serious breaches of the peace, which the law recognises as a fundamental entitlement of every resident and citizen. Assaults upon the integrity of a person constitute criminal trespass against the person and therefore breaches of the peace that the criminal law in particular has been harnessed to uphold. 24. The criminal law has long recognised the dangers to the peace I talk about at the hands of a mob. Long associated with lawlessness is the mob mentality. Be it a gang or be it a mob, the use of numbers to achieve unlawful ends has always been recognised by the criminal law as a circumstance of aggravation. In this case that circumstance of aggravation is to be measured by an increase in the maximum penalty for this offence of two years, thereby uplifting the maximum penalty to one of seven years. 25. There are other features of aggravation. In respect of the charges associated with the security officer at the hotel two of these offenders had previously been banned from the premises. It is a ban those two should have respected. They did not. Regrettably the evidence does not disclose the identity of the two previously banned. Thus while it be a circumstance of aggravation I am unable to sheet it home to any offender. I am satisfied indeed it is the case of all that each was well affected by alcohol. I am satisfied Mandic acted reasonably in requesting them to leave the premises on account of their intoxication. Thereafter the licence of each to enter had been terminated. It was incumbent upon all of them to leave peacefully. They apparently commenced to leave peacefully, but as they approached the door their exit was marked by offensive abuse, particularly by the use of the word “Motherfucker” and racial based taunting. 26. While I am satisfied their offending was not motivated by racism even the use of taunts such as mimicking a foreign accent or referring to one’s national identity in a derogatory way is based upon racism and as such constitutes and aggravating feature. Not all aggravating features are of equal heinousness. Where an offence is motivated by racism then that display of racism constitutes a powerful feature of aggravation. 27. I am satisfied the racial taunting played some part in Mandic’s offensive response. All defendants rely upon what they claim was a provocation that was a consequence of Mandic’s spittle being directed towards them. I am satisfied Mandic spat towards them. There is nothing in the evidence that suggests any of the spittle landed on any of them. As best I can discern the facts the offenders were outside the pub when spat at. Mandic was either just in the pub when he spat or retreated into the pub immediately after. 28. In any event the three offenders unlawfully entered into the pub chasing him. Their entry into the pub in those circumstances was an aggravating feature, they had no right to be there. 29. The assault was to the head as well as to the body. The head is a particularly vulnerable part of the body. It houses the eyes and brain, both organs susceptible to or of traumatic injury. 30. Thereafter the offenders used bar stools to assist in their assault. The use of any implement must aggravate the criminality of the offence. My own view is that throwing the bar stools is not as vicious as holding it and wielding it as a weapon but the offences criminality is none the less aggravated. 31. The offence against Mandic was an offence against a person who was tasked with maintaining the good order in the precincts of the pub. Whilst it may be true publicans use security staff to protect their property as well they also, that is security staff also fulfil an important responsibility owed by the publican of maintaining good order about the precincts of the pub. While security staff, while in performance of the public and civic responsibility are not peace officers, such as police officers, nonetheless it seems to me to attack them is an aggravating feature. 32. The second offence was against the victim Dews. It was a more serious offence than the first. Dews is described by Bertram as small, little and weak. Another offender is said to have thrown him back onto the seat. I have no reason to doubt Bertram’s description. It does not appear to have been contested by any of the defence. I have already noted each of the defendants appears as athletic. While the evidence is not specific, the cases have been run on the proposition, and I have inferred that, Dews was alone. Small, little, weak and alone, he must have presented as a vulnerable victim against three attackers. The striking of Dews by Bertram could not have been provoked by his comment. The attack was about a refusal by Dews to supply a smoke. There is nothing to suggest that Dews’ response to Bertram was other than an attempt at repartee or humour. Bertram’s loss of total tolerance is demonstrated by his kicking. While I have some difficulty picturing that scene the use of the foot is regarded generally as more obnoxious than the use of a hand or fist. 33. Frank Robinson next sought a cigarette. He was handed the cigarette Dews was smoking. The third request was made for further cigarettes. Dews replied he had none. There is no evidence to suggest he was not telling the truth and some evidence, namely his surrender of the half smoked cigarette to suggest he was truthful. In any event he was kicked to the face by one of the Robinsons. Thereafter Dews sought to protect himself. The assault that then followed has been detailed in the facts. It appears more ferocious than the earlier assault as it involved kicking as well as punching. Again the head was targeted and I repeat the comments I earlier made about the head. The taking of the phone caused unnecessary concern for Dews. Although that concern was no doubt alleviated upon its return. Bertram’s final remarks to Dews were belittling and patronising. The injuries to each victim have been recorded in the facts. Certainly they qualify as actual bodily harm. On analysis they can best be described as abrasions, pain, bruising and soft tissue injury. While they are not minimal, more severe injuries could have been inflicted that would still fall below the appellation “grievous bodily harm”. Below grievous bodily harm is only covered by the term actual bodily harm. These injuries would have been resolved fairly quickly. There is no evidence of any need for medical intervention. 34. Neither offence was planned. Each was impulsive and opportunistic. There is some close temporal relationship between the first and second offences in terms of time, place, state of inebriation of the offenders, mood and in the presence of the same co-offenders. 35. The second assault was broken off without any intervention of any third party. The first assault was broken off when Miss Manning made clear the police were being called. Again once the punching began it would appear she did not thereafter intervene other than to indicate she was calling the police. 36. The offences were committed when each offender was well affected by alcohol. It is more probable than not that the executive functions of the brain of each was compromised by quantities of alcohol consumed. Judgment, reasoning and comprehension functioning would have been impaired. Normal social inhibitions would also have been functioning poorly. The impact of alcohol however pulls the sentencing discretion in two ways. In one sense the criminality of the offending is lessening because of the compromised mental functioning. But where the presence of alcohol is part of a consistent pattern of alcohol abuse, then the rehabilitation prospects of those offenders are seriously diminished impacting adversely on the offender’s sentencing outcome, (compare R v Engert (1995) 84 A CrimR 67).37. Each of these offences is sufficiently serious as to call for terms of imprisonment. Each offender comes before the Court bail refused. Nonetheless I am satisfied full time incarceration would have been required for the second offence and for the totality of criminality. Subjective features. 38. I turn now to the subjective factors of each offender. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence but I am also sentencing each offender for it. Each offender coming before the court varies from other offenders who stand or have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of these offences by these offenders or some reason why a more or less sentencing outcome is appropriate. 39. I will start with Shane Bertram.Background and personal relationship - Shane Bertram40.  Bertram is a nineteen- year old Aborigine. He will turn twenty in March next year. He is the fourth eldest of six children, two sisters, and three brothers. He lived in a home of weekend alcohol abuse and domestic violence. He appears to acknowledge physical violence used upon him and his siblings occasionally as a most severe form of punishment. Education skills and employment - Bertram41. He attended local schools in Parramatta. His primary schooling appears to have been successful. However his transition to secondary schooling was problematic. At secondary schooling level he associated with negative peers. He commended truanting, was suspended on more than one occasion and expelled in Year Eight. Thereafter he was assigned to a new school targeting, as best I can tell, children with behavioural difficulties. He left that school because he had lost interest and motivation. He has no formal education beyond Year Eight. He persisted in playing rugby league at school and club level until the age of seventeen. Remember that would only be two years ago. 42. Bertram has little employment history six months as a bricklayer, I suspect he means as a brickies labourer. Bricklaying is a recognised tradesman’s job requiring a trade certificate. I pause to say that in the hope that he may consider it as an occupation. He also worked completing container repairs, although what skills were involved in that task I do not know, but suspect perhaps, welding. Again a certificate trade course. One it seems to me also open to him. General health - Bertram43. As far as one can tell from appearance Shane Bertram appears to be a fit, strong, healthy, athletic nineteen- year old man. As I say he appears to have played rugby league up until two years ago. He reports having a broken jaw occasioned when struck by a baseball bat three or four years ago. He has severed tendons of his right forearm as a result of punching a window, no doubt when he was both angry and drunk. Otherwise he has no present complaints as to his physical fitness. Mental health issues - Bertram44. There is a personality profile compiled by Miss Emma Collins, a clinical psychologist, tendered by the defence. In the course of testing she found him to be in the bottom three per cent of intelligence but felt that was an underestimate because he rushed his responses. Miss Collins felt his intellectual abilities to be higher than the scores indicated. She felt he was borderline/low average range as being closer to the mark. Other testing disclosed he was prone to anger, may have difficulties in interpersonal relationships and some traumatic memories. Although the cause of those traumatic memories does not appear to have been disclosed in any fulsome way, regrettably in my view. 45. There were some mildly antisocial features, which she felt needed to be a focus of supervision. Elsewhere Miss Collins spoke of an escalating antisocial trajectory to date. All that being said there was however no specific diagnosed mental health condition arising from her testing. Alcohol and drugs – Bertram46. Bertram was experimenting with alcohol and cannabis during his first year of high school. Six months prior to his arrest his drug abuse had escalated. There was also an escalation of alcohol abuse. His drugs of choice are cannabis and amphetamine. He was consuming alcohol regularly at sixteen, drinking daily or at least every second day thereafter. His daily consumption he puts at twelve to eighteen beers. His cannabis use commenced aged thirteen and graduated to daily use by sixteen. He has used amphetamine, crystal methamphetamine, both of which regularly. 47. This pattern of drug and alcohol abuse continued until his arrest and incarceration. He appears more concerned about his alcohol abuse than his drug abuse. From my point of view his alcohol abuse and cannabis abuse are alarming and his abuse of other drugs is of great concern. I made the point, I think, during submissions that cannabis in particular can have as a side affect aggression. Emma Collins was concerned that his gambling could be heading towards an impulse disorder. Her analysis of the symptoms does not establish that condition yet. Character and criminal history - Bertram48. Shane Bertram is a nineteen- year old indigenous male. He is hardly old enough to have developed mature character traits. His upbringing has exposed him to violence as a male response to irritations. It would appear he has learnt that response only to apply it in criminal behaviour. He has skills in rugby league and one senses has satisfaction in playing the game. His alcohol and drug abuse distracted him from developing his skills, reputation and perhaps career in sport. He has accepted a position of responsibility whilst in custody, namely that of chapel sweeper, a position which involves a medium level of trust and requires an ability to work unsupervised. The Chaplain at the Parramatta Correctional Centre says in a reference, “He has fulfilled his duties, is polite, helpful and well mannered”. 49. His prior criminal convictions include Children and Local Court matters but no District Court matters. In November 2005 he was dealt with for enter vehicle without consent. He has goods in custody in the Lidcombe Children’s Court and in the Parramatta Local Court an assault occasion actual bodily harm for which he appears to have been imprisoned for four months. In September 2006 he was given a twelve month bond for maliciously destroy property with a condition relating to alcohol rehabilitation. At the same time there were also offences against peace officers. There is offensive behaviour. 50. An overview of his criminal antecedents reinforces the impression that his criminal conduct is related to his alcohol and drug abuse. What is not disclosed in the evidence is what are the causes of his alcohol and drug abuse. No doubt that may well be related to whatever it is that relates to the symptom of post- traumatic stress. There is a worrying trend, the gradual escalation of the seriousness of the offending and the consequential increase, custodial sentence being called for on each occasion. 51. His character assessment and criminal history are beginning to suggest that the skills and the abilities he had are beginning to be lost in a morass of alcohol and drug abuse. Time in custody - Bertram 52. Prior to commencing these remarks it was established that he spent two days in custody on 10 and 11 November 2006, thereafter he was bailed.At some point, unclear on the evidence before me, he was rearrested and sentenced to four months imprisonment. That sentence was backdated to 21 November 2006 and expired on 22 March 2007. I must accept that the magistrate had good grounds for backdating it to 21 November. The principle of totality requires some concurrency of sentence and some accumulation. I will date the sentence I impose from 23 January 2007 making it a two-month cumulative and two-month concurrent sentence. Attitude to the offence - Bertram53. The offender accepted the police facts, he blamed his alcohol consumption, claiming alcohol makes him reactive and on occasion aggressive. He expressed what Emma Collins described as remorse for his conduct and described the impact his behaviour had upon his own and the victim’s family. Two points need to be made. Firstly as I said earlier, blaming the alcohol is a cop out because many people drink to excess without becoming violent. It is important that he discover and explore what it is that causes him to be violent when he drinks. It is not the alcohol but some anger or learned behaviour that floats through the alcohol to the surface, as he becomes less constrained by normal social inhibitions. Secondly, he did not give evidence. It is unclear to me how Emma Collins obtained this information. It is not from tests it is likely to have been from questions and possibly leading questions at that. At the time of this offending Bertram was on bail for a similar offence committed in July 2006. He was also on section 9 bond imposed less than two weeks before this offending. His commission of these offences therefore are aggravated by his failure to be of good behaviour in circumstances where the court had imposed such a condition as a precursor to his being released on bail and on a bond. Prospect of rehabilitation - Bertram  
     
      
      · This offenders prospects of rehabilitation must be assessed as clouded.  
      · He appears to have little and simplistic insight into the offending conduct and it’s causes. · At the time of his offending he was on section 9 bond that had been imposed one month before. · And bail also a bit more than a month before.· He has entrenched alcohol and drug problems, which are not yet addressed in custody or in the community. · The fact that he has committed offences whilst on bail and a bond suggests court procedures have little impact upon his behaviour. · His associates appear to have a negative influence upon him.· There is no history of prior rehabilitation attempts.· He appears to abandon interests such as rugby league in favour of drug and alcohol.  
      
    54.  On the other hand there are some positive rehabilitation factors. 
     
      
      ·  
        
      He has used his custody time productively in obtaining a job as sweeper, focusing on courses, linking himself back in to Aboriginal culture and some vocational related courses.  
       
      ·  
        
      He seems to recognise the link between alcohol consumption and his offending conduct.  
       
      ·  
        
      He appears to have some skills in sport that may be a means of widening his social contacts and extending his capacity to enjoy himself in a healthy way.  
       
      ·  
        
      He enjoys good health. 
      
    55. I turn now to Phillip Robinson. Background and Personal Relationships 56. He was born in October 1982. At the time of this offence he had turned twenty-four. He is now twenty-five. His family emigrated from New Zealand to Australia when he was thirteen. He is Maori. His father was a heavy drinker, resorted to harsh physical punishment as a tool to impose discipline. There was also domestic violence focused on his mother leading to a breakdown from the parent’s marriage. As irony would have it both he and his brother left New Zealand to be away from the impact of alcohol and drugs on the community in which they were living. This offender has had little contact with his father since 2003. He is close to his mother and siblings including the co-offender, Frank Robinson. He appears well supported by his mother who visits him regularly in prison. Other family members also appear to support him. 57. He has a six- year old son from a prior long- term relationship. He provides care for this boy in the community. His reputation within the family is as a caring considerate father. The ex-partner continues to support him. Education skills and vocational employment – Phillip Robinson 58. The offender left school aged 14. He had completed Year Seven. He gained limited literacy skills. He has frequently truanted. His employment history is primarily as a casual unskilled worker. His past working experience includes mowing lawns and working in the demolition industry. It is said by Probation and Parole he had secured permanent employment in the demolition industry prior to his arrest. General health Phillip Robinson59. He is a young man tending towards a stocky build. From his general appearance he presents as being in good physical health. Mental health - Phillip Robinson60. He is described by Probation and Parole as having anger management problems engendered by childhood experiences. Otherwise there is no material in evidence upon which any assessment of mental health issues either favourable or unfavourable can be made. Drug and alcohol issues - Phillip Robinson61. The offender has a history of heavy alcohol use both as a juvenile and adult. He is a regular user of cannabis, a drug frequently associated with violent behaviour as a side effect. He claimed to Probation and Parole he had reduced his alcohol consumption to one to two nights fortnightly. Although on this occasion which was a Thursday night, Friday morning he had consumed substantial quantities of alcohol to a point of inebriation. How he was hoping to attend work the following day is a mystery. 62. In his last custody and again in this he has worked on drug and alcohol programs. He assesses himself as having improved during his last post release period. I am prepared to accept that. Attitude to the offence - Phillip Robinson63. He accepts police facts. He expressed regret and was said by Probation and Parole to have demonstrated a high degree of victim empathy. He claims however his role in the offending conduct has been overstated. Character and criminal antecedents - Phillip Robinson64. One gains a sense from the Probation and Parole report that Phillip Robinson has begun to address his rehabilitation issues. He has used his custody on two occasions to revisit alcohol and drug programs. When last on release he found full time employment. He has good qualities as a father. However his criminal antecedents disclose two serious offences of violence in his past including assault occasioning actual bodily harm and aggravated robbery with wounding. He was on parole for this offence when the two offences before the Court were committed. He had less than a month of a two and a half year parole to complete when he re-offended. It is noted his commission of the offence whilst on parole is a serious breach of the expected good behaviour that was a pre-condition of his release on liberty to serve the balance of his sentence in the community. His breach of parole aggravates his criminality in regard to each of these offences. Rehabilitation prospects - Phillip Robinson65. Rehabilitation prospects are dependant upon this offender’s future attitude to alcohol, drugs and whatever is driving his alcohol and drug abuse. Should he have the courage and self- discipline to deal with those matters his rehabilitation prospects would be strong. He has strong family support although whether it is targeted towards his rehabilitation is unclear and I suspect not. At the time of his offending conduct he was working in demolition, an important rehabilitation indicator. It is important he obtain employment as soon as possible upon release. Self- image, an adequate income stream and a central structure to daily life flow from regular employment. At twenty-five he is still young, hopefully he is gaining in maturity, reaching an age where he can exercise self discipline when irritated as an option to avoiding subsequent imprisonment. Custodial history - Phillip Robinson66. This offender was arrested on the 10 November 2007. He has been in custody since that time. His parole was revoked on 10 November 2006. That revocation was backdated to 3 October 2006. The reasons for the revocation were expressed as breach of conditions; 4(a), fail to report to supervising officer,  4(b), failed to reside at an address agreed upon and  10, fail to seek assistance in controlling his drug and/or alcohol abuse. 67. It will be seen those breaches have nothing to do with this offence. The conviction on this offence will constitute a further breach. That breach will be considered by the Probation and Parole Board on 18 January next. An issue arises as to when this offender’s sentence should date from. In my view it should date from a date on which he was prepared to accept responsibility for his criminality associated with these events. That would appear to be a date in the latter half of February this year. Exhibited before me is a letter directed to the Office of the DPP noting a refusal to accept a plea to affray (a more serious offence than these) and assault occasion actual bodily harm which I take to mean in company in full discharge of the then charges. I intend to date this sentence from 1 March 2007. That date makes some allowance for totality as well as for the fact that he accepted responsibility for his offending at about that time. I am also motivated by what I understand to be the policy implications to be found in section 47(5) of the Crime Sentencing Procedure Act 1989. 68. I come now to the subjective features for Frank Robinson.69. Personal circumstances and background.70. Frank Robinson was born in New Zealand, his parents are Maori. He remains a New Zealand citizen. He emigrated to Australia at the age of eleven. As with his brother it was the family’s decision to remove themselves from heavy drinking and violence in the local community. His father was a heavy drinker. There was domestic violence in the family directed towards the mother and towards the children. Shortly after his parents came to Australia they separated, the two brothers remaining with their mother. He continues to be close to his mother and like his brother has not seen his father for a couple of years. 71. He first became a father at the age of fifteen. His daughter is now eight. He no longer has contact with that child’s mother but sees his daughter regularly through contact visits arranged by his own mother. He has a two- year old son to another lady. She is no longer in a relationship with him but continues to be friendly towards him. He sees his son regularly. He claims to have paid regular child maintenance for both children since they were born. He regrets the negative impact his offending behaviour will have upon his children. Education skills and employment – Frank Robinson72. He was educated to year eight level leaving school to obtain employment when he became aware he was to become a father. He has been employed for the majority of his nine years since leaving school mainly as a casual worker doing labouring jobs in the construction industry. In the eight months prior to his incarceration he too was working full time permanent employment as a warehouse assistant, again a positive rehabilitation indicator. He says he prefers to work whether in gaol or in the community. General health - Frank Robinson73. As with the other two he appears to be fit, strong, athletic and healthy. On my calculation he is twenty­three years old. Mental health - Frank Robinson74. There is no psychological or psychiatric report before the Court. There is nothing in evidence before me to suggest the presence of any psychological or psychiatric issues that would impact adversely on his sentencing. Alcohol and drugs - Frank Robinson75. He commenced consuming alcohol on weekends whilst still at school aged fourteen. When he began working at fifteen he increased his drinking to seven days weekly including heavy binge drinking on the weekends. In the twelve months prior to his incarceration he was again drinking seven days a week becoming extremely intoxicated on any four of them. On the day of the offence he had commenced drinking at 1pm. If he was working full time it would seem he must have been drinking at work. He consumed over forty standard drinks prior to the commission of the current offence. He perceives himself to be a problem drinker and he is correct in so perceiving. He says he cannot cease drinking once he has started. If he cannot learn strategies for that there is only one solution and that is not to drink at all. 76. In many indigenous communities including our own Aboriginal community per one thousand people there are more indigenous people who do not drink at all than white persons in one thousand whites. Aa fact not as well known in the indigenous communities as it should be; that is there are a greater number of abstainers in the indigenous community pro rata than there are in the white community. 77. This offender also has a history of drug abuse, having used cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy on a regular basis since fifteen. His main drug of choice yet again is cannabis, no doubt thinking it relaxes him, which it may do for the moment but adding aggression as a side effect. He has been taking two ecstasy pills twice monthly since age 16 and amphetamine on three occasions in the twelve months prior to his offending. Character and criminal history – Frank Robinson78. This is a young man who appears to have attempted to use his time in custody productively. I will return to this shortly. He has shown some responsibility towards his children by continuing to support them financially. Like his brother he appears to have a fairly strong work ethic. That is to his credit. He clearly has problems though with alcohol and cannabis and to a lesser extent the other drugs. His criminal history is a worry. In 2001 in Bidura Children’s Court he was before that court for offences he committed in June of that year of robbery in company. There were three of them on my count. On 16 January 2002 he was charged with larceny. On 29 June 2002 there is an offence of maliciously destroy or damage property. In February 2004 he has a mid range PCA and driving on the road whilst suspended. He has at the same time a drive a vehicle recklessly or in a speed or manner dangerous to the public. In May 2004 he was charged with making a statement, which was false or misleading and receiving stolen property. But for the earlier robberies his record would not otherwise be a bad one. To date all of his offending has been dealt with by courts having summary jurisdiction; that is Courts dealing with lesser offences than this court normally deals with. 79. I said he had used his time in custody well. He has been incarcerated in the main section of Parklea Correctional Centre. He has not incurred any institutional misconduct. He has been employed in the furniture workshop for the past eleven months. He has received positive reports of his work performance from his overseer. He has been described by his wing officer as a quiet inmate who gets on well with both other inmates and staff. Whilst he has been in custody he has taken advantage of literacy classes and attended a short drug and alcohol program. That was a four- week drug and alcohol addiction course and as a result of doing that he was awarded a certificate. Attitude to the offence - Frank Robinson80. He claims and it may well be right that he was intoxicated to such an extent on the night that he can remember little about the events. Once informed of what he had done he said he was ashamed, very sorry for his victims, they did not deserve what they got. Police on the other hand maintain he was not heavily intoxicated and was in control of his actions on the night. My own view is that he probably was well affected by alcohol. 81. This offender has been in continuous custody since his arrest, his sentence will be backdated to 10 November last year. I now come to dealing generally with all three again. Plea status 82. The pleas were entered on arraignment. It would appear though that all three offenders were willing to plead to these offences prior to committal for trial. An issue of allegation of robbery however caused the prosecution to hesitate in accepting that plea. That issue was resolved in the offenders favour prior to arraignment. Their pleas are a demonstration of acceptance to their criminal responsibility and I accept in some cases evidence of contrition. Subject to my remarks earlier that one of them was a little simplistic but no doubt still regrets the way he treated these two people. Setting the sentence/ Deterrence.83. Theses are offences in which deterrence must play a part. It seems to me that sentences of imprisonment and the shutting of the prison gate by themselves are powerful forms of deterrence. Discount for the pleas of guilty84. I intend to give each of the offenders a discount in the order of twenty per cent for their pleas of guilty. Discounts are given in recognition of the utilitarian value of a plea. That utilitarian value relates to the time saved in court by virtue of the plea, to the resources freed up so that other people can have access to legal aid and the prosecution can turn it’s attention to other cases. Utilitarian value also relates to the very strong likelihood that there will be no appeal on the question of guilt in relation to matters to which offenders have pleaded guilty. It is important that the community see that those who are responsible for crime are punished for it and a plea of guilty has that utilitarian value as well. 85. Finally a plea of guilty is an endorsement of the capacity and function of the police in investigating crime and bringing those responsible for crime before the Court. As I say in the circumstances I am proposing a discount of twenty per cent. But for one issue it seems to me that all of the offenders should be treated equally. The single issue, which distinguishes two of the offenders from the third is the aggravating feature that two of them committed this offence whilst they were on conditional liberty. That being so in respect of the two offenders whose offences are more aggravated than the other an additional period of three months parole will be attached to their sentences. 86. For the offence of assault occasion actual bodily harm upon Mandic the sentence that I propose to impose was one of eight months imprisonment, twenty per cent of that becomes an impossible figure to calculate actually but it is 1.6 months which I make one and a half months, leaving a sentence of six and a half months. 87. In respect of the sentence of assault occasion actual bodily harm upon Dews the sentence I intend to impose but for the plea of guilty was one of fifteen months. Twenty per cent off that makes it a sentence of twelve months. I intend that the non-parole period for that offence will be one of nine months and the balance of term will be one of three months. 88. In respect of the offender Frank Robinson there will not be a balance of term, it will be a fixed term. I intend to accumulate the sentences and have them partly concurrent so that the overall non-parole period as it were will be one of twelve months imprisonment. Those sentences will date from the day that I have indicated. 89. Now we come to the sentencing exercise. Gentlemen of the bar table make sure that I get this right if you would please. 90. Mr Robinson, even though your sentence will have expired by the time I give it to you, you will still need to go down into custody to be signed out. My own view is that the sentence is finished and you do not have to if you do not wish to, but it will serve the administration of criminal justice so far as your custodial officers are concerned, if you go down and sign out. They have no warrant to hold you and if things become uncomfortable or you are not treated civilly you can ask to be released immediately. My experience is prisoners such as you are treated civilly and have no cause really to ask to be released other than perhaps a bit of claustrophobia. But you are not required to remain in custody but I invite you to do so to assist those officers in the execution of their duty. He is not to be put in a cell while he is downstairs. Formal Orders 91. If each of you would stand. If I find a copy of the court attendance notices I can do this relatively quickly. 92. Phillip Conan Robinson, Frank John Robinson and Shane Bertram, each of you is convicted that you on Friday 10 November assaulted Ivan Mandic occasioning to him actual bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation in that each of you was in the company of the others. For that offence I sentence each of you to a term of six and a half months imprisonment, I will tell you in a moment each which day I will date it from . 93. You are also likewise convicted that you at about the same time and in the same place assaulted Alan Dews occasioning to him actual bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation in that each of you were still then in the company of the others. In respect of that offence I sentence you Frank Robinson to a fixed term of nine months imprisonment. As to the other two I sentence you to a non-parole period of nine months and a balance of term of three months. Those sentences will date three months after the last lot of sentences I gave you. 94. Mr Frank Robinson , your sentence will date from the date of your incarceration on 10 November 2006 and your first sentence will expire on 9 May 2007. Your second sentence will commence on 10 February 2007 and expired on 9 November last. You are entitled to be released forthwith. You may sit down. 95.  Phillip Robinson , your first sentence will date from 1 March 2007 and will expire or did expire on 30 June 2007 - sorry withdraw that - expired on 30 September 2007. Your second sentence commences on 1 June 2007 and expires on 29 February 2008. Your balance of term will expire on 31 May 2008. I order your release for this offence on 29 February 2008. I will put that in simple language for you so that you understand. If the Parole Board releases you, you will otherwise be released on 29 February. If the Parole Board decide to keep you longer, I do not know whether they can or not, you will have to answer to them, not to me. But I have an order for your release on 29 February. It means the only difference is that if you commit an offence within that three- month period that you are on balance of term you are back in again. 96. Mr Bertram , your first sentence commences on 23 January 2007 and will expire on 22 July 2007. Your second sentence begins on 23 April 2007 and expires on 22 January next year. I order your release on 22 January next year. Your additional term will expire on 23 April 2008. Again you will be released on 22 January but if you commit any offence within the next three months you will be in breach of your parole and you will go back 97. Is there any other order I need to make Madam Crown.WONG: No your Honour.

   SENTENCE 1  On 9 April 2006 a young man by the name of Ashur Audisho was murdered. The Crown alleges that he was murdered by two men, Steven David and Linnard Shamouil. Originally the offender, who will be known by the initials AB, was also charged with the murder of Mr Audisho but on 23 November, 2007, when the Crown presented an indictment with two counts in the alternative, the offender pleaded guilty to the offence of being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Mr Audisho and the Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. This offer by the offender to plead guilty to that offence had been made some time earlier, even before he was committed for trial. It was eventually accepted by the Crown shortly before the offender's trial for murder was due to commence. 2  On 9 April, 2006 at about 6 o'clock in the evening the offender was driving home in his own car. He rang Mr Shamouil on his mobile 'phone and asked him what he was doing. Mr Shamouil said he would call the offender back and he did so about five minutes later, asking him to come to where Mr Shamouil was. The offender then did a U turn and drove to Mr Shamouil's home. When he got there Mr Shamouil and a man by the name of Steven David were waiting out the front for him. They both got into the offender's car and said, ""Let's go for a drive to the 7-Eleven"". They told the offender that they wanted to talk to someone for about five minutes. The offender drove them to the 7-Eleven on the corner of Hamilton Road and The Boulevarde, Fairfield. During that journey Mr David telephoned Mr Audisho and asked him to come to the 7-Eleven. Unbeknownst to the offender Mr David and Mr Shamouil had a score to settle with Mr Audisho. 3  When the offender got to the 7-Eleven he parked his car in the street. Mr David and Mr Shamouil left, telling the offender to stay in the car, but the offender got out of it and walked down to the service station at the front of the 7-Eleven store. There the offender saw a person whom he knew. He has been described in the materials put before me as ""the source"". He was having a cigarette in the carpark of the 7-Eleven store. The offender and Mr Shamouil also approached and they exchanged greetings. At this time there was conversation between ""the source"", Mr Shamouil and Mr David about an allegation that Mr Audisho had threatened Mr Shamouil's cousin. 4  Mr Shamouil and Mr David asked the source to bring Mr Audisho to see them. They told him that if Mr Audisho apologised nothing more would happen. The source was told that all that was required was an apology. The source then replied that he would go and get Mr Audisho, Mr Shamouil and Mr David and repeated that all they wanted was an apology and Mr Audisho would not be harmed. Accordingly, the source left and returned a short time later with Mr Audisho. Mr Audisho got out of the source's car. Mr Shamouil approached him and told him that he wanted to talk. Mr Shamouil and Mr Audisho walked away towards the entrance to the car park at the front of the liquor shop nearby. After about a minute the others approached. 5  At this stage there was an argument between Mr Shamouil and Mr Audisho about the dispute which was said to have existed between Mr Audisho and Mr Shamouil's cousin. Mr Shamouil accused Mr Audisho of threatening to shoot his cousin. Mr Audisho denied this. There was a scuffle in which Mr David began screaming at the deceased and punches were thrown. It was at this stage that Mr Shamouil pulled a gun from beneath his jumper and shot the deceased, Mr Audisho, three times. 6  Immediately afterwards the offender, Mr Shamouil and Mr David then ran back to the offender's car, got into it and the offender drove them all away. The offender dropped Mr David off in a back street on the way back to dropping Mr Shamouil at his home. The assistance that the offender provided to Mr Shamouil and Mr David therefore consisted of removing them from the scene of their crimes. The journey involving Mr David was relatively short. That involving Mr Shamouil was not much longer, taking about five minutes to drive from where Mr Audisho was murdered to Mr Shamouil's home. 7  Mr Audisho was pronounced dead when he arrived at Liverpool Hospital. It was found that he had three gun shot wounds to his body with one in particular involving a bullet being lodged in his left chest area near his nipple, which caused his death. Other injuries were observed to Mr Audisho's body, no doubt being occasioned during the scuffle which preceded the shooting. 8  Police investigating this matter soon learned, presumably through the use of closed circuit television cameras, of the registration number of the vehicle in which the offender, Mr Shamouil and Mr David drove away. They identified quite quickly that that was the offender's car. They were after him and the offender knew this. He surrendered himself to police in company with his then solicitor on 24 April, 2006. On this day he participated in an interview with the police. He was arrested and charged and has remained in custody since that day. The offender later participated in a further interview with police whereby an induced statement was obtained. Following that that there was also an occasion where the offender went with police and drove with them to relevant places, re-tracing his movements on 9 April, 2006. 9  It is appropriate before proceeding further that I extend my sympathy to the family and friends of Mr Audisho. The maximum penalty for the offence to which the offender has pleaded guilty is a sentence of imprisonment for 25 years. The offender is 21 years of age. He is the youngest in his family. He was born in Iraq but had to leave when he was about ten because of his religion. He is a Catholic and two of his uncles have been killed in Iraq. At first he and his family went to Greece before they arrived in Australia when he was 12 or 13 years of age. The family lived in Melbourne for a while before they came to Sydney where they settled in the western suburbs. The offender's family was a close one and he still enjoys their support. He had been living at home immediately prior to becoming arrested. The offender left school when he was 16 years old after he completed year 10 because, as he said to a psychologist who prepared a report which is tendered before me, he wanted to work and help his family. At school he had been a below average student. No doubt the fact he didn't speak any English before coming to Australia contributed to his lack of academic success. 10  Consistent with the reason that he left school, he has been fairly regularly employed since then, working in a fish and chip shop, a service station as an apprentice electrician, and at a McDonald's restaurant. His last employment was labouring at a manufacturing company although he suffered a hernia which required surgical repair so he had not been working for a few months prior to his arrest. He does not consume alcohol and his involvement in illegal drugs has been minimal. 11  References attesting to his prior good character were also tendered to me today. They speak of him being hard working, kind and respectful. The offender does have a criminal history although only for driving matters. He did perform a community service order imposed upon him for one of those driving matters, that being successfully completed. For present purposes I will ignore his criminal history. I should mention he is facing trial for an unrelated matter but in the absence of a conviction of course that is a matter that is also irrelevant to me. I mention it only because it affects the precise order that I will make at the end of these remarks on sentence. 12  One of the most important factors which I must bear in mind in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender concerns his assistance to the authorities. The offender has provided assistance in the past to the police by telling them what occurred on the 9 April, 2006 including, as I mentioned before, retracing his steps with them. But it is his assistance in the future which is of most significance. The offender has undertaken to give evidence against both Mr Shambouil and Mr David. A signed undertaking to that effect was tendered to me today. Of course, one of the most important factors in assessing the impact that that assistance will have on the sentence to be imposed concerns the value of that promised assistance. There was no material from a police officer put before me today but the Crown Prosecutor advised me that without evidence from the offender the Crown would have difficulty in obtaining a conviction against Mr Shamouil, the man alleged to have actually done the shooting. 13  The value of the offender's promised assistance is somewhat less in the case of Mr David because of other evidence available against him but there is no doubt that, taken as a whole, the offender's promise of assistance is of considerable value to the authorities. That promise of assistance came fairly early in the piece too, it first being provided to the police on 20 June 2006. As a result the offender has been held in protection and there was evidence before me demonstrating that the conditions of his custody are at present more onerous than the general prison population. 14  I mentioned earlier the circumstances of the offender pleading guilty and, although actually only entered shortly before his trial was due to commence, the plea had been offered to the Crown before he was committed for trial. The discount which would be imposed for the utilitarian benefit of that plea is therefore a significant one. I will not separately indicate the discounts I have allowed for the assistance to the authorities and the plea of guilty but will indicate that, taking both of those matters together, the sentence I will impose on the offender is half what it would otherwise have been. At the end of these remarks on sentence I will also indicate the discount I have allowed for future assistance. The Court of Criminal Appeal encourages sentencing judges to do this in the event that an offender fails to comply with his or her undertaking. It makes matters easier for the Court of Criminal Appeal in the event that there is an appeal under s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act. I have some reservations about whether this can be done in every case as it tends to suggest a precision in sentencing which is unwarranted, but I am able to indicate the discount I have allowed for future assistance in this case and I will do so at the end of these remarks on sentence. 15  I am satisfied that the offender is remorseful. That is not only sorrow for what has happened to Mr Audisho and sorrow at what his family must be feeling but also regret for his involvement. He did at one stage say in evidence before me that he had little choice but to drive Mr Shamouil and Mr David away after Mr Audisho was murdered but acknowledged that if the same thing happened again he would call the police. There is other evidence suggesting his remorse as well, not the least of which is the offender's assistance and promise of future assistance. Sometimes it can be seen that an offender is assisting the authorities purely for the benefits which he can achieve, but the finding that his assistance is at least partially motivated by remorse is consistent with other evidence before me. 16  I also take into account that this was an offence which was unplanned. Of course when I say this offence was unplanned I mean the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. He had circumstances thrust upon him. He did not know when he went to the 7-Eleven with Mr Shamouil and Mr David what was going to happen and so he had but a very short time to decide what to do after Mr Audisho was killed and Mr Shamouil and Mr David re-entered his car asking to be driven away from the scene. 17  Many offences, if not most, of being an accessory after the fact to murder similarly involve situations not of a person's doing but being thrust upon them. The cases reveal that some people respond reluctantly and some enthusiastically. The assistance that some offenders provide is brief and relatively immaterial but the assistance that others provide is on-going and of considerable assistance to the principal offender. For example, some people who have been convicted of being an accessory after the fact to murder have assisted in disposing of evidence, or harbouring an offender for a lengthy period of time, and even disposing of the body. I will return to the assistance which the offender offered to the principals in this case when I consider other sentences imposed for offences of this type later in these remarks on sentence. 18  The offender was, those driving matters aside, of otherwise good character. His decision to assist Mr Shamouil and Mr David must be seen in the context of the fact that he knew Mr Shamouil was armed with a firearm and had just seen him use it on someone. In that sense, therefore, (and I don't wish to use the word duress in any technical sense), the offender was under duress at the time he was asked to drive away from the scene. The offender has good prospects of rehabilitation as well. No doubt the experience of having been kept in custody for more than a year and a half has been a salutary lesson to him. That experience will play a very important part in assisting the offender to avoid the commission of any further offences. As I mentioned, that time in custody has been served on protection and there was evidence before me to indicate the relative harshness of the conditions of that custody. 19  Mr Scragg suggests that in evaluating the sentence which I should impose upon the offender, taking into account his pre-sentence custody, I should bear in mind the conditions of the offender's custody to date. I will do that. Although the maximum penalty is, as I have indicated, 25 years imprisonment, a perusal of the sentencing statistics available from the Judicial Commission and other cases where offenders have been sentenced for being an accessory after the fact to murder, demonstrate a considerable gap between the tariff and the maximum penalty. It is not for me, however, to begin now to impose a sentence on the offender which is above that which the general tariff would suggest. If there is to be a general increase in the level of sentences imposed for sentences for this offence, that is a matter which can be addressed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, not me. 20  I was referred to five cases which were of assistance to me in formulating the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender. The first was the decision of R v Farouk & Farouk, unreported CCA 29 March 1996. There the offenders assisted a man who had murdered his own daughter. He arrived at their home with blood on both his body and his clothes. They allowed him to take a shower and provided him with a change of clothing. They helped him wash blood from his car and helped him to drive his vehicle away. They told their children that they should say nothing about what they had seen and heard. 21  In the course of considering a Crown appeal against the asserted leniency of the sentences imposed upon the offenders, Gleeson CJ said this:  
     
      
      ""The maximum penalty is penal servitude for twenty-five years. There is, however, a wide variation in the possible degrees of moral culpability of persons convicted of this offence. The present was not a case, as sometimes occurs, where an accessory after the fact has been personally involved in a criminal enterprise although the involvement falls short of participation as a principal or where an accessory is associated with criminal elements and has become an accessory by reason of that association."".  
      
    22  This case has much in common with the way Gleeson CJ just described the circumstances in Farouk and Farouk. Although it may well be that Mr David and Mr Shamouil were criminal elements themselves, there is no evidence to suggest that the offender knew this. Although he did drive them to the 7-Eleven and although they appear to have been planning something, the offender was not to know, and did not know, what they had in mind. The Crown appeal in R v Farouk and Farouk was allowed. The Court of Criminal Appeal indicated that a proper head sentence at first instance would have been one of between two and three years penal servitude. 23  The next case to which I was referred was that of R v Dileski, [2002] NSW CCA 345. The offender in that case was called to a factory where an associate of his had just murdered his employer. Relevant to the question of his culpability for being an accessory after the fact to murder, he fobbed off those who came looking for the deceased and effectively remained as a care taker of the premises whilst the principal offender was absent. In considering the offender's appeal against the sentence imposed, the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to the decision in R v Farouk and Farouk. In R v Dileski also there was assistance to the authorities which, when taken into account, together with the offender's plea of guilty, resulted in a reduction in sentence of fifty percent. The Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the appeal and imposed a sentence of imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of one year. 24  Next I turn to the decision of R v Quach [2002] NSWSC 105, a sentence of Simpson J. The assistance provided by the accessory in that case involved assisting the principal to move and then dispose of the deceased's body. Simpson J said,  
     
      
     ""Assistance in the disposal of a body after murder takes a crime of this kind into the upper echelons of the offence of being accessory after the fact to murder"".  
    25  Her Honour sentenced the offender in that case, after discounting it by fifty percent, to reflect a plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities, to imprisonment for two years, partially suspending that sentence as the law then allowed her to do. 26  The next case to which my attention was drawn is one of R v Scowen [2007] NSWSC 792. What the offender did in that case was to delay the apprehension of the principal offender. She went with him from place to place over a period of two days and provided her mobile 'phone for use by him. She thus provided support for the principal to assist him to avoid detection and apprehension by police. Kirby J, who sentenced the offender, said that her actions could be seen as more tending towards contributing to delay the principal's apprehension. Mr Scowen, who pleaded guilty at an early opportunity, was sentenced to imprisonment, that consisting of a non-parole period of 12 months, less three days with a balance of term of four months. 27  The final case which I will refer to is the decision of R v Amirol No 2 [2007] NSWSC, 323, again a sentence of Kirby J. In this case the assistance provided by the offender was serious. He was present when the deceased's throat was cut. After that he involved himself in some very gruesome activities in order to dispose of the body and assisted in the cleaning of the murder scene. He also pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to imprisonment to a period of four years and three months with a non-parole period of three years and two months. 28  Those sentences and the statistics to which I have earlier made reference demonstrate what I said was the gap between the maximum penalty which Parliament has provided for this offence and the general level of sentences being imposed. Those cases have been of considerable assistance to me, although no two cases are alike, of course. I have been able to review the objective facts of the cases to which my attention was drawn and compare the objective criminality of the offender in this case. I find that the offender's objective criminality, although serious, was towards the lower end of the range. It involved a period of criminality of only five minutes and came about when circumstances were thrust upon him and must have been at least partially influenced by the fact that one of the men whom he was assisting had, to his knowledge, just shot a person and was still armed with the murder weapon. 29  This is a case where I will also find special circumstances enabling me to extend the period of eligibility for parole at the expense of the non-parole period. There are, however, constraints on the sentence that I can impose. I am not able to discount a sentence because of assistance to the level where the sentence is unreasonably disproportionate to the objective gravity of the offender's conduct and the non-parole period I select must also bear a relationship to what the offender did. It was serious criminal conduct for him, knowing that a young man had just been shot, to assist those who had just done so by driving them from the scene of the crime and taking them to a place of refuge. 30  The offender has been in custody for a period of one year, seven months and eighteen days. Mr Scragg submits in the circumstances of this case that that is a sufficient period of imprisonment or, at the very least, is sufficient as a non-parole period. I accept his latter submission. I do not, however, consider that a head sentence of that length is sufficient. The offender is sentenced as follows: 31  I set a non parole period of one year, seven months and eighteen days to date from 24 April, 2006 and impose a head sentence of two and a half years' imprisonment. The non parole period expires today and so as far as this matter is concerned I order that the offender is to be released to parole forthwith although, as I mentioned, he is currently bail refused on an unrelated matter. 32  I will indicate that in the absence of the undertaking to give assistance in the future, the head sentence would have been one of three and a half years imprisonment. 33  I order that the undertaking signed by the offender is to be placed in an envelope which is to be sealed and only opened upon an order by a Judge of this court or of a superior court.

      JUDGMENT 
        
       
       
      1. This is an application by Grant Ian Mitchell to reverse a plea of guilty. The plea of guilty was entered to three charges, which I will generally describe as aggravated sexual assault. They were committed against a girl who was under sixteen, which meant that they were aggravated. When I say “they were committed” that is the allegation contained in the indictment which is part of exhibit 1. 
       
       
      2. Mr Mitchell was charged on 29 June 2005. The matter was listed for mention at the Local Court and he was committed for trial on 21 October 2005. After various mentions in the District Court it was listed for trial on 9 October 2006. It was stood over to 10 October 2006 in order to edit a video which had been made of the complainant, presumably for the purpose of it being played during the trial. On 10 October 2006 Mr Mitchell entered pleas of guilty to the three charges of aggravated indecent assault. 
       
       
      3. It is agreed that the onus rests on Mr Mitchell to satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that his application ought to be granted. The law on the topic is, both Mr Gibson who appears for the Crown and Mr Cooley who appears for Mr Mitchell agree, well settled in  
      Regina v Sagiv 
       (1986) 22 A Crim R 73. Mr Justice Lee, as his Honour then was, speaking on behalf of the Court of Criminal Appeal said at 80 that such an application is a matter for the discretion of the presiding judge. His Honour said that each case must be looked at in regard to its own facts and a decision made whether justice requires that that course be taken. His Honour went onto say: 
       
        
         
        “ 
        It is clear that in the case of mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as admission of guilt the court should readily grant leave. But if the plea has been entered in full knowledge of all the facts and intentionally as a plea to the charge which is made, the court is plainly entitled to exercise its discretion against a withdrawal of the plea. The law regards a plea of guilty made by a person in possession of all the facts and intending to plead guilty as an admission of all the legal ingredients of the offence and is the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made, for the court is prepared to act upon it and proceed to conviction or final disposal of the proceedings. 
        ” 
         
        (I have omitted his Honour’s references to authority.) 
        
       
      4. In  
      Regina v Liberti 
       (1991) 55 A Crim R 120, Justice Kirby when his Honour was President of the Court of Appeal, speaking on behalf of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said that such an application is approached by the courts: 
       
        
         
        “ 
        with caution bordering on circumspection. This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all the relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence. 
        ” 
        
       
       (Once again I have omitted reference to authority.)  
       
      5. Finally in  
      Regina v Hura 
       (2001) 121 A Crim R 472, Chief Justice Spigelman, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, emphasised that such an application will normally allege a miscarriage of justice. His Honour said at 477 - 478 that such cases are exceptional and his Honour identified a number of circumstances where such applications have been granted. Three of those circumstances were where the plea was not a free and voluntary confession, where the plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt and where there was mistake or other circumstances affecting the integrity of the plea as an admission of guilt. 
       
       
      6. In this application I have heard evidence from two expert and well qualified forensic psychiatrists, Dr Westmore and Professor Greenburgh. In addition I have evidence from Mr Mitchell’s counsel at the time of entering the plea, Mr Hoare, and I have also heard evidence from Mr Mitchell himself. There have been tendered various exhibits to which I will make reference shortly. 
       
       
      7. Briefly, Mr Mitchell’s evidence was that he decided to plead guilty when he did because he felt depressed and “ 
      just wanted the matters to be over 
      ”. He did not care what happened to him. He maintains his innocence. He related the circumstances of an industrial accident which had occurred a matter of weeks before he entered his plea. He was trapped inside a pipeline at work. It was filling with water. He entertained a genuine belief that he would die in the accident. It seriously affected his mental health. It left him with post traumatic stress disorder.  
       
       
      8. In an affidavit filed by him he sought the leave of the court to reverse his plea on three bases: that he did not enter his plea on a free and voluntary basis because of his symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder; that he did not and does not hold a genuine consciousness of guilt; and that he maintained his dispute with the allegation up until the plea. 
       
       
      9. I omitted to mention that there was also evidence in the form of a report from a psychologist Mr Probets, who saw Mr Mitchell. Briefly Mr Probets was of the opinion that Mr Mitchell was, as a result of his accident, suffering post traumatic stress disorder which brought about extremely severe levels of anxiety and depression. He was of the opinion that Mr Mitchell would have lacked the capacity to fully discern the consequences of pleading guilty. He said that people with such a condition often approach decisions such as this with the attitude of wanting to get it over and done with. He thought Mr Mitchell was extremely unlikely to have pleaded guilty had the accident not occurred.  
       
       
      10. Dr Westmore diagnosed an acute stress disorder which has become a chronic post traumatic stress disorder. That diagnosis was based upon the history given of the work accident. He also diagnosed anxiety, depression and intermittent panic attacks. The conditions were likely to have affected his judgment at the time he entered the plea. Dr Westmore also regarded the phenomenon of “wanting it all over with” regardless of the outcome, as being not uncommon with patients suffering from anxiety and depression. He thought it possible, probably likely, that something similar occurred in this case, particularly, he said, if Mr Mitchell maintained his innocence strongly up until that point. 
       
       
      11. Dr Greenburgh was of the view that Mr Mitchell had symptoms consistent with post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression, but he took issue with whether they were extremely severe. He saw no marked deterioration in functioning which would justify such a conclusion. He was of the view that Mr Mitchell did not lack the capacity to enter his plea of guilty. The symptoms were not so severe that he required hospitalisation or lacked the capacity to reason or have insight. He was of the opinion that Mr Mitchell had adequate capacity with his mental and cognitive ability to make a reasoned decision at the time of the plea. He thought Mr Mitchell’s judgment or choices may have been influenced by his mental state but not his capacity. 
       
       
      12. As I said, both doctors gave evidence. Dr Westmore in cross-examination agreed with Dr Greenburgh that Mr Mitchell’s ability to make judgments and choices was impaired by his illness. He also agreed with Dr Greenburgh that Mr Mitchell did understand the consequences of pleading guilty at the time. He classified Mr Mitchell’s post traumatic stress disorder as in the moderate range rather than extreme. 
       
       
      13. Mr Hoare gave evidence of the circumstances of accepting the plea. It is important to note here that Mr Cooley makes no suggestion of any impropriety whatsoever on behalf of Mr Hoare. Mr Hoare described Mr Mitchell taking time to think about the decision as to whether to change his plea or not. He recalled that he went away and came back some time later. He recalled Mr Mitchell taking issue with an item in the agreed facts which is part of the process he was asked to sign. That item concerned an allegation that sexually offensive behaviour had occurred on occasions other than the occasion of the offences in question. Mr Mitchell wanted that removed but after negotiation that application was unsuccessful. Mr Hoare thought that Mr Mitchell came back after about an hour. He agreed that he wanted to proceed with his plea. He thought that Mr Mitchell was stressed but no more than many people at the time of facing their trial and was not unduly agitated. Mr Hoare never told his client that if he pleaded guilty he would not go to gaol, nor did he say that the Crown would not oppose a non-custodial order because of the work accident. 
       
       
      14. Mr Mitchell’s evidence supplemented his affidavit. Asked about his state of mind on 9 October 2006, the day before he changed his plea, he said that he was in various states of mind. He was fed up, he had had enough, his own health and existence were severely affected. He wanted the case over and done with and finalised. He felt that he had given up and did not care whether he went to gaol or not. 
       
       
      15. I turn now to the balance of exhibit 1 which to my mind is very important in determining this case. Exhibit 1 comprises a series of documents which roughly came into existence at the time of the change in plea. Document 3 in exhibit 1 is a signed acknowledgement by Mr Mitchell dated 10 October 2006, saying that he wished to enter a plea of guilty to the charges and he accepted that “ 
      I have committed the acts alleged 
      ”. It acknowledges the possibility of a full time gaol sentence and that the decision is made of his own freewill.  
       
       
      16. Document 4 is also signed by Mr Mitchell. It is a document called “Agreed Facts on Sentence”. Those facts include the following: the offender and the victim got into bed; they were both naked; Mr Mitchell rubbed the victim on her chest; he spoke about his penis; he touched the victim on the outside of her vagina. It also included a passage saying that the victim stated that this was not the first time that she had been assaulted by Mr Mitchell but that it had occurred some 20 times over the last four or five years.  
       
       
      17. Document 5, also dated 10 October 2006, were notes prepared by Mr Hoare’s instructing solicitor. The notes were made at the time of the conference with Mr Mitchell to obtain his instructions. The notes summarise the exchanges which occurred in that conference. It included this passage: “ 
      You must be prepared to say ‘I have done these offences’ 
      .” “ 
      Admission of guilt. 
      ” It makes reference to a gaol term. It makes reference to the fact that Mr Mitchell can have time to speak to anyone or to have coffee. It notes that Mitchell, at 10.30am, went to make some phone calls. It also notes that at 11.15 the pleas of guilty were entered in court and the matter adjourned to 8 December 2006.  
       
       
      18. Document 6 is a letter from Mr Hoare to his instructing solicitor. It notes Mr Mitchell’s approval of the signed copy of the agreed facts. It makes reference to the work event and suggests the obtaining of psychological and psychiatric evidence for the sentence proceedings.  
       
       
      19. Another document in exhibit 1 is a report from a psychologist called Julie Lefranc. She saw Mr Mitchell on 18 November 2006 and 2 December 2006. She notes in her history that: 
       
        
         
        “ 
        Mr Mitchell reported that the offence took place on or about 21 March 2005 when he indecently assaulted [the victim] (a ten year old girl) at his home at Silverdale. 
        ” 
         
        
       
      It contains an account, in some detail, of what happened, including him having a few drinks and having a shower and that the young victim came to his room at about 11.30pm after her shower. It said that they hopped into bed together. It said then,  
       
        
         
        “ 
        Mr Mitchell reported that that night he touched her on the vagina. He said that he fell asleep and the next morning whilst he remembered touching her nothing was said. Mr Mitchell reported that he took [the victim] to work with him [the victim’s mother] picked [the victim] up and took her home. He said nothing was said about the incident until October 2005. Mr Mitchell denied touching the victim in the past and said “with [the victim] I abused her trust.” [The psychologist expressed the opinion] that “Mr Mitchell feels shamed by his behaviour and regrets touching[the victim] on the night of 21 March 2005. He reported that whilst he had been drinking, his drinking did not excuse his behaviour and said that he felt remorseful for abusing her trust. 
        ” 
         
        
       
      20. Document 8 is a presentence report dated 4 December 2006 prepared for the sitting of the court on 8 December 2006 to which the proceedings had been adjourned. The author of the report David Moffitt said that: 
       
       
        
        “Mr Mitchell has agreed, somewhat reluctantly with the police facts. He described that it was an unfortunate series of events and it was ‘a stupid thing to do’. He has attended two sessions with a specialist forensic psychologist to begin to address his offending behaviour.” 
         
        
       
      It further said that Mr Mitchell, “ 
      acknowledges the consequences of his behaviour on himself and his family. 
      ” 
       
       
      21. By a further handwritten document, numbered 9 in exhibit 1, signed by Mr Mitchell and dated 8 December 2006, he confirmed his earlier instructions that he wished to maintain his pleas of guilty. He also confirmed the agreed statement of facts that were to be tendered and which he signed on 10 October 2006. He also acknowledged that the sentence will be deferred for the medical reports. 
       
       
      22. I have no reservation in accepting the documents which I have just referred to, which are part of exhibit 1, as all being authentic, indeed there was no challenge to their authenticity. 
       
       
      23. Mr Cooley’s argument in support of his client rests on a number of submissions. One is the chronology of events which demonstrates a relatively short period of time in weeks from the work accident to the entry of the plea of guilty. It was, as he said, a short timeframe. A second submission acknowledges the common ground that Mr Mitchell’s judgment had been affected by the accident. I say “common ground” because both psychiatrists agreed. He acknowledged that there was no evidence before me of Mr Mitchell strongly maintaining his innocence which was a factor referred to by Dr Westmore. It said that the integrity of the plea in this case was affected by the diagnosis which was common ground and the impact of the diagnosis on Mr Mitchell’s judgment. There was, as Mr Cooley said, a concrete basis for the assertion that something was not right. The integrity of the plea was therefore affected. 
       
       
      24. I have determined to reject those arguments and to reject the application. Briefly I am of the view, so far as Mr Mitchell’s bases in his affidavit are concerned, that he did enter his plea on a free and voluntary basis, although suffering from the effects of post traumatic stress disorder. There can be no doubt from the documents that he signed on 10 October 2006, in circumstances where he had time to reflect and make phone-calls, that his plea was free and voluntary. Not only that, but the admissions of guilt since then to the psychologist and probation officer confirmed that. He maintained his plea of guilt for some months afterwards. I reject his argument that he does not hold a genuine consciousness of guilt, whereas I might have had a reservation had the evidence been limited to the events on 10 October 2006. His behaviour over the months following that leaves me with no doubt that he entertained a genuine consciousness of guilt. He admitted details of the offences to the psychologists. He expressed remorse and contrition. He took steps to have what he saw as the reason for his behaviour treated. I accept that he maintained his dispute with the allegation up to 10 October 2006.  
       
       
      25. I see the force of Mr Cooley’s argument concerning the sequence of events. It was by the sounds of it an horrific accident. I have no doubt that it had the impact which the psychiatrists claim. It also, no doubt, affected Mr Mitchell’s judgment, but whether that impact was such that it gave rise to a miscarriage of justice is another matter altogether. People who make decisions are affected by all sorts of matters which can cause stress. Some of them may be psychological and others physical. Making decisions under stress is not unusual. This is an illustration of someone who was making a very serious decision under stress, the stress partly unrelated to the nature of the decision and caused by a work accident. Nevertheless, the evidence points clearly, in my opinion, to the fact that Mr Mitchell understood what he was doing in pleading guilty. Not only that, but he maintained that plea and went further to express remorse and contrition over the next few months. 
       
       
      26. I do not regard the psychological and psychiatric evidence of post traumatic stress disorder as affecting the integrity of the plea such as to give rise to the risk of a miscarriage of justice. As I said, it had an impact upon him. It may have affected his judgment, but I have no doubt that he knew what he was doing and did what he did through a genuine consciousness of guilt. 
       
       
      27. As Justice Kirby said, I must approach this application with caution bordering on circumspection. Mr Mitchell has taken the solemn step of pleading guilty before a court to three charges which, as the authorities say, amounts to an admission by him of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence or offences in this case. He has confirmed those pleas over the following few months. There is, as Justice Kirby said, a high public interest in the finality of these proceedings.  
       
       
      28. I do not see any miscarriage of justice involved in refusing Mr Mitchell the opportunity to withdraw his plea and I therefore reject the application.

    SENTENCEFacts1 The offender knew that he had a problem with alcohol. He knew that he drank too much and that he became angry when drunk. Despite that he continued to drink to excess until, on 24 October 2005, he stabbed his de-facto partner, Dyonne Hillman, in the neck, killing her. 2 Ms Hillman, a woman by the name of Maria Gordon, and a man by the name of Byron Smith, started drinking together on the morning of Sunday 23 October 2005. At about mid-day the three of them went to an address in Dubbo which was the home shared by the offender and Ms Hillman. The offender was there and he joined the others in drinking wine. At one stage the offender and Mr Smith left the home, went to his sister’s place where they borrowed money from her and then to a liquor store where they bought two casks of wine before returning. Others arrived during the course of the afternoon. One person in particular who arrived was the offender’s first cousin Aaron Gordon. He, unlike the others, did not drink that day. During the evening Mr Smith and Mr Roberts left the premises because they were too drunk. Before he left, Mr Smith helped the offender to bed. After he left there were four adults in the premises: Ms Hillman, the offender, Maria Gordon and Aaron Gordon. 3 About twenty minutes after he was put to bed the offender came out to the lounge room. He then suffered a seizure and fell to the lounge room floor. The offender suffers from epilepsy and indeed had not been drinking for about four months before this day because of that circumstance. After he fell to the floor both Ms Hillman and Ms Gordon went to his assistance. For reasons which are not immediately obvious, but are no doubt due to the amount of alcohol they had both consumed, Ms Hillman and Ms Gordon began to struggle. Mr Gordon separated them. Once again the offender was assisted to go to bed. 4 At around eleven o’clock Ms Gordon left the house with her three children and went home. Mr Gordon and Ms Hillman remained in the lounge room watching television. Once again the offender left his bedroom and came out to the lounge room. He had clearly been drinking a lot and required the assistance of Ms Hillman who guided him to the lounge. He then had another seizure. After he came around he tried to get up. Ms Hillman tried to help him but he simply fell down in front of the television. He remained there for about forty minutes. Whilst he was lying on the ground Ms Hillman went to bed, Mr Gordon then helped the offender up onto the couch when, for a third time, he appeared to have a seizure. Ms Hillman told Mr Gordon to put the offender onto his side and then left the premises to get some more alcohol from Mr Smith. When she returned she drank some of the wine that she had obtained and went back to bed. 5 At about 1.45 am on 24 October 2005 the position was this: Ms Hillman was in bed whilst the offender and Mr Gordon were in the lounge room. Ms Hillman got out of bed, went into the lounge room and yelled at the offender to go to bed. The offender told her to “fuck off”. She tried to guide him to a bedroom at the end of the hall but he resisted her. He yelled out “I don’t want to go in a fucking room”. At this stage Mr Gordon heard the sound of a bang and Ms Hillman calling for help. He went to the bedroom and saw the offender punching Ms Hillman to her face. She was lying on her back on the bed and the offender was on his knees next to her. Mr Gordon rescued Ms Hillman by grabbing the offender by the scruff of his shirt and pulled him away to his own bedroom. Mr Gordon returned to the lounge room leaving the offender in his bedroom and Ms Hillman in the bedroom at the end of the hall. 6 About fifteen or twenty minutes later he heard some footsteps, saw the offender moving quickly towards the kitchen, heard the sound of cutlery being moved around and saw the offender go from the kitchen and walk down the hallway towards the bedroom where Ms Hillman was. Then Mr Gordon heard her scream loudly and so he ran to the bedroom. There he saw the offender on top of Ms Hillman with a knife in his hand. He saw the offender’s arm come down towards the deceased and then come back up level to his ear. There was blood on the knife. Mr Gordon grabbed the offender’s right wrist and took the knife from him with some difficulty. He was yelling “stop it, stop it” to the offender but the offender was replying “stay out of it”. Mr Gordon grabbed the offender and pushed him out of the bedroom door. He placed the knife on a cupboard in the corner of the bedroom. 7 He then went to Ms Hillman and saw that she had a small puncture mark on the side of her neck. Ms Hillman was conscious however and when Mr Gordon asked if she was all right she responded, “yeah, I’m alright”. Unfortunately it was this wound which would later cause Ms Hillman’s death. 8 Mr Gordon left the bedroom and found the offender in the lounge room. Mr Gordon told the offender that he was going to ring for an ambulance but the offender physically blocked access to the phone. He returned to Ms Hillman and again he asked if she was all right and she again said that she was. Nevertheless he, quite sensibly of course, thought that it was necessary to ring for an ambulance. He went back to the lounge room and tried to grab the phone but was interrupted by the offender. He said to the offender “you gotta ring the ambulance”, but the offender simply told him to go. Mr Gordon did leave after being told by the offender that he would ring for an ambulance. He never did.9 When Mr Gordon left the house he went to stay at a relative’s house. She did not have a telephone. Sometime over the next few hours Ms Hillman died as a result of being stabbed by the offender in her neck. The offender telephoned the home of his sister and brother-in-law at 6.07 am. He said to Mr West “come and get that twenty dollars, I think she is dead”. (The first part of what the offender said is explained by the circumstance that he had previously borrowed twenty dollars from Mr West.) Ms Darcy and Mr West went to the offender’s home where they found him on his front steps, crying. They went into the house, saw that Ms Hillman was dead, and phoned triple 0.10 Two police officers arrived a short time afterwards. They saw the offender, Ms Darcy and Mr West sitting on the front steps of the premises. They approached the group and said, “what’s happened?” The offender said, “I’ve killed me missus, I’ve stabbed her” and raised his arms up so that he could be hand cuffed. He was taken to Dubbo police station where he declined to participate in an interview. He did however deny admitting killing the deceased when he was at the premises. The offender now claims to have no memory of the relevant events. 11 Ms Hillman died because when she was stabbed by the offender one of the blood vessels leading to the left side of her brain was damaged. This led to bleeding into the soft tissues of the neck and the entry of air into the blood stream and into Ms Hillman’s heart. Victim Impact Statements12 The Crown tendered three victim impact statements which I read. They eloquently set out the harm felt by others as a result of the death of Ms Hillman. I will treat them in accordance with long established authority and I express my sympathy to all those who have suffered as a result of Ms Hillman’s tragic death. Subjective Circumstances13 The offender was born in 1961. He has a lengthy history of alcohol abuse which was a common problem within his family. One of the consequences of his abuse of alcohol is that he has problems controlling his anger when he is drunk. As I mentioned earlier he also suffers from epilepsy.14 He was one of five children to his parents and he also had an older half brother. He was born at Warren but moved with his family to Dubbo when he was young, before returning to Warren when he was aged seven. His father was a hard worker who mainly worked as a cook in shearing sheds. Although his father drank, he did not drink heavily and was never violent. The offender started drinking at the age of 18 and at one stage he was drinking methylated spirits as well as smoking marijuana. He has had some periods of reasonable sobriety since then but, as the facts of this matter demonstrate, he has relapsed.15 The offender has been seen by psychiatrists and psychologists but what they report as to the offender’s background is not entirely consistent. The offender himself did not give evidence before me and so some unimportant matters remain unresolved.16 There is a very curious aspect to one of the reports tendered on behalf of the offender. Dr Reid, a clinical neuro-psychologist, provided a report. It is six pages long. On the last page this appears: 
     
      
      “9.7 With regard to the causes of Mr Darcy’s cognitive and psychological impairment, I am of the opinion these date from early childhood sexual abuse, the subsequent psychological trauma that this has caused throughout his life. Stemming from this he has abused alcohol as a means of controlling depression and the psychological trauma of the childhood sexual abuse, and the abuse of alcohol has in turn resulted in brain impairment”. 
       
      
    17 It is the reference to early childhood sexual abuse which is intriguing because there is no reference in any of the earlier five pages of Dr Reid’s report to the offender telling him that he had been sexually abused as a child, nor is there any reference to such a suggestion in any other material put before me. I raised this with Ms Davenport SC who appeared for the offender. On behalf of the offender she disclaimed any reliance on a claim to have been sexually abused as a child and suggested that Dr Reid must have simply made a mistake. 18 The offender has a criminal history but, especially for a person with a long- term problem with alcohol, there are not that many matters on it. There is an offence of malicious wounding in 2003 for which he was put on a suspended sentence after appealing to the District Court (to which I will make further reference later) but as far as can be gleaned from the criminal history tendered by the Crown the malicious wounding is the only significantly serious offence that the offender has committed in the past. The offender has never served a sentence of full time imprisonment until now.The Intent to Kill19 It was submitted on behalf of the offender that I could not be satisfied that the offender intended to kill Ms Hillman when he stabbed her with the knife to her neck. I do not accept that submission. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that is what the offender intended.20 Even given his substantial level of intoxication it is difficult to accept that a person would stab another person in the neck without intending to kill them. That is not to suggest that a person necessarily intends the natural and probable consequences of his or her action, but in the circumstances of this case where the offender armed himself with a knife, got on top of Ms Hillman, stabbed her in the neck, and was prevented from inflicting any more injuries with the knife by Mr Gordon’s actions, then I am satisfied the offender intended to kill Ms Hillman when he stabbed her.21 It is to be noted that the offender made positive efforts to prevent Mr Gordon calling an ambulance to treat Ms Hillman. The Crown relies on this circumstance as supporting his submission that when the offender stabbed Ms Hillman he intended to kill her. The offender’s actions in preventing the calling of an ambulance are however also capable of being explained by a desire on his part to prevent the authorities becoming aware of what he had done. In those circumstances I have not taken these actions of the offender into account when determining what he intended when he stabbed Ms Hillman.22 It is also noteworthy that the offender did not inflict further violence upon Ms Hillman after Mr Gordon left. In particular he did not stab her again. That may tend to suggest that at the time Mr Gordon left the premises the offender did not intend Ms Hillman’s death. But it is the offender’s intention at the time he stabbed Ms Hillman which is most relevant. It may be that after the knife was taken from him by Mr Gordon the offender changed his mind about whether he wanted to kill Ms Hillman. It may be that at that stage he even wanted her not to die (although it has to be said that one way of ensuring that would have been to have called an ambulance). But I repeat that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time the offender stabbed Ms Hillman in the neck with the knife he intended to kill her. Remorse23 The offender appears to have shown immediate remorse upon finding Ms Hillman dead. He was crying when his sister and brother-in-law arrived at the premises and made immediate admissions to police when they arrived. It does appear that the remorse did not extend to the offender maintaining his acknowledgment of guilt because a short time after making those admissions he denied that he had done so.Planning or Pre-Meditation24 This was not a case where the offender has spent days planning to kill his de-facto wife, but there was nevertheless some pre-meditation. It is apparent that after the offender punched Ms Hillman and was dragged away by Mr Gordon the offender had twenty minutes in which to reflect upon what he would do next. Nor was this a case where the offender picked up a weapon which was conveniently nearby in the course of a struggle. His decision to arm himself with a knife was a deliberate one. That is relevant not only to determining how pre-meditated this offence was but it is also instructive because of what it reveals about the validity of the offender’s claim that his moral culpability is reduced because of the relationship between this offence and the seizures he had earlier (a matter I will turn to now).The Offender’s Moral Culpability25 One of the primary matters relied on by Ms Davenport was a submission that the offender’s moral culpability should be reduced because of the circumstance that he murdered Ms Hillman shortly after having a number of seizures. She said that the evidence established that there was a connection between the offender’s epilepsy and his offence. She conceded that the onus was on her to establish this mitigating feature on the balance of probabilities. 26 I am not satisfied that the offender’s epilepsy had anything to do with his offence. Indeed I am certain that it didn’t. 27 The offender has been examined by a number of doctors with expertise in epilepsy. The offender tendered reports from Dr Lethlean and the Crown tendered reports from Dr Beran. Part of the history which Dr Beran took account of was observations of seizures suffered by the offender whilst he was in custody. Those observations were not themselves tendered before me but Dr Beran extracted relevant parts in one of his reports. Those who observed the offender suffering a seizure whilst in prison reported that at no time did Mr Darcy become aggressive or violent once the seizure had passed. Dr Beran concluded: 
     
      
      “These reports are very important because generally seizures follow a stereotypic pattern and on this occasion the patient had two seizures in close succession. This would suggest that if aggression was to be part of the pattern for this man it would have been exaggerated after two seizures, recognising the seizures described by the two eye witnesses were essentially identical.” 
      
    28 Later he said: 
     
      
      “It is most important to note that after two seizures in close succession there was not a hint of aggression and the patient became fatigued and slept deeply. This is typical of people who have had a generalised convulsive disorder and is at significant odds with what is suggested, namely that this patient may have been in a post-ictal confusional state at the time of previous alleged assaults. I do not accept this as a viable option within this case and even more so the description of the possible seizures the patient had is also at odds with the previous descriptions provided by the Corrective Services Officers. The seizures described by the officers do sound to be epileptic in nature and the history is convincing, more so than is anything that has been supplied to explain previous behaviour.” 
      
    29 Clearly Dr Beran’s opinion does not support a finding that there was a connection between the seizures he suffered on the night of 23 October 2005 and the offender’s later actions in killing Ms Hillman. Ms Davenport instead relied on the evidence of Dr Lethlean whose reports were also tendered. He was asked to provide his expert medical opinion in relation to whether a person having a seizure can behave in a completely different way to their normal behaviour. This is what he wrote: 
     
      
      “It is the case that in the period following a grand mal seizure a person can behave in a completely different way to their normal behaviour. This is normally a period of confusion, with interruption of normal ongoing speech and other activities. 
       
       
      Overall, violence and destructive behaviour are rare/uncommon, and usually caused when the confused subject is forcefully restrained. Person to person directed violence is rare, but a limited number of cases is documented. I would certainly accept as a possibility that Mr Darcy could have been violent in the post-ictal phase of his seizures. Twice violent activity is attributed to previous seizures in Mr Darcy’s case. That he appears to have sought a knife prior to the alleged offence is somewhat more ‘intentional’ than spontaneous and reactive”. 
       
      
    30 There are two things of importance to note. First Dr Lethlean did not take into account the observations made by those who saw the offender having a seizure whilst in custody, and perhaps more importantly, there is his qualification in relation to the offender arming himself with a knife. I interpret the last sentence in the passage from Dr Lethlean’s report quoted above as Dr Lethlean expressing some considerable doubt as to whether the offender’s actions in killing Ms Hillman can be explained, or even partially explained, by his earlier seizures. 31 This is not a case where the offender, during or immediately after a seizure, lashed out at those trying to restrain him. To the contrary he had been left alone in his room for twenty minutes. This was not a case where violence was inflicted by a confused person who was being forcibly restrained. The offender was seen to be staggering as he moved towards the kitchen but this is no doubt explained by his high level of intoxication. He was sufficiently aware of his surroundings to be able to walk directly into the bedroom where Ms Hillman was. None of the actions of the offender immediately before he killed Ms Hillman suggest any confusion at all. I am satisfied that the effects of his seizure had well and truly passed by the time he took the decision to kill Ms Hillman.Alcohol32 There is much material suggesting that the offender becomes angry when drunk. Ms Davenport attempted to make a distinction between a person who is angry and a person who is violent and while the two concepts are of course different they are very closely related. 33 He had earlier committed a very violent assault when highly intoxicated. He was convicted of malicious wounding and received a suspended sentence of imprisonment. The sentence had expired by the time he committed the offence for which I must sentence him. The pre sentence report obtained in relation to that earlier offence revealed that the offender “has problems controlling his anger when under the influence of alcohol”. The author of the report said: 
     
      
       
       “Mr Darcy appears to have little insight into his offending behaviour and minimises his responsibility by stating that he was under the influence of alcohol and has no memory of the offence”.  
      
    34 He was also seen by a psychologist in relation to that earlier offence. Importantly the report reveals that the offender recognised at that stage the connection between his alcohol consumption and offending. The psychologist, Mr Tyrer, said: 
     
      
      “ Mr Darcy’s criminal history is, according to self reports, made up of convictions for assaults, malicious damage, offensive language and resist arrest over a period of approximately twenty years. He claimed that the incidents were largely alcohol related”.  
      
    35 Later the report says, “Mr Darcy acknowledged that alcohol abuse was the major contributing factor to his criminal behaviours”. 36 In those circumstances I do not regard the fact that the offender had consumed an excessive amount of alcohol, to the extent that he was clearly highly intoxicated at the time he killed Ms Hillman, as a significantly mitigating feature.37 In this case the fact that the offender was significantly intoxicated is neither a significantly mitigating nor an aggravating feature. R v Fernando38 Ms Davenport relied upon the principles to be found in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 although she did say that this was not “an extreme situation”. As is well known Woods J (as he then was) set out a number of propositions. Proposition (e) was this;  
     
      
      “While drunkenness is not normally an excuse or mitigating factor, where the abuse of alcohol by the person standing for sentence reflects the socio-economic circumstances and environment in which the offender has grown up, that can and should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. This involves the realistic recognition by the court of the endemic presence of alcohol within Aboriginal communities, and the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self-image, absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralizing factors have placed heavy stresses on them, reinforcing their resort to alcohol and compounding its worst effects”. 
      
    39 Having regard to the circumstances of the offender’s background this was not a case where the “grave social difficulties” referred to by his Honour were a significant feature.40 That is not to say that I have ignored the Fernando principles. Indeed the circumstances of this offence demonstrate the endemic presence of alcohol within the offender’s immediate community. This case is not to be treated as one where the offender’s level of intoxication was unusual in his immediate community and that in turn is a relevant factor in considering why he drank as much as he did in the hours leading up to the death of Ms Hillman. The Objective Seriousness 41 Of course because of the offender’s plea of guilty the standard non-parole period of twenty years is not of direct application, nevertheless it remains as an important guidepost to the sentence I should impose in this matter.42 The offender’s intention at the time he stabbed Ms Hillman is of course an important factor in determining the objective seriousness of his conduct. I take into account that the offender had earlier struck Ms Hillman as demonstrating that the violence which ultimately led to her death was something which appears to have been building up over time. I take into account that there was only one stab wound inflicted by the offender, even after Mr Gordon had left the premises. 43 I will also take into account that there was some, albeit limited, planning and premeditation, although that was of course limited by the relatively short time between the offender leaving his room to get the knife and going to the room in which Ms Hillman was as well as the offender’s significant intoxication. The fact that the offender was drunk is further, independently, relevant to the objective seriousness of this offence – a calm, cold blooded killing is objectively worse than killing done by a person whose mental state is disturbed by the presence of a great deal of alcohol although I repeat not too much can be made of this in the offender’s favour because the offender well knew that he became angry when drunk.44 For the reasons I have given I assess the objective seriousness of the present offence as being at slightly below the middle of the range.Comparative Cases45 Both the Crown and the offender relied on a category of sentences for murder where a person, usually a man, murders his domestic partner. There are two things I should say about that reliance. Firstly many of the cases pre-dated the introduction of the standard non-parole period of 20 years. And secondly it is not at all apparent that the fact that such cases have one feature in common means that they are of more assistance to me than other cases, where someone other than a person’s domestic partner was murdered, which have one or more features which also arise in the present case. One might just as easily have chosen the category of murder cases dealing with stabbings whilst intoxicated or murders where the objective seriousness is slightly below the middle of the range. 46 For this reason my assessment of the appropriate sentence in the present case was undertaken after considering the general pattern of sentencing for all murder offences, in particular those which post date the introduction of standard non-parole periods, rather than only those murder cases where a domestic partner was killed. That is not to say that I did not find the cases relied on by the Crown and the offender helpful – I did - but I have borne in mind the consideration I have just referred to, namely that some domestic murders are very different from the matter before me at present and that sentences for some non domestic murders are also of assistance.The Discount for Pleading Guilty47 This matter had been listed for trial on four occasions before it came before me on 12 November 2007. The trial was due to commence that day. The intention was that legal argument would take place and a jury would be empanelled the following day. However the offender pleaded guilty, apparently after having had the benefit of advice from Ms Davenport concerning the effect of a report obtained by the Crown and served upon her shortly before. 48 The circumstances of the offender’s plea of guilty led to some submissions from Ms Davenport concerning the extent of the discount I should allow for the utilitarian value of the offender’s plea. Ms Davenport submitted that the discount should be 20% on the basis that the plea was entered as soon as material became available which strengthened the Crown case concerning the effect of the offender’s epilepsy on the question of his substantial impairment. I do not accept that the utility of a plea of guilty is affected by the fact that, as here, the offender was entitled to wait and see what case the Crown had against him before deciding what course he should take. Of course the offender was entitled to do that and of course the offender was entitled to explore the possibility of successfully defending himself on a charge of murder, but that is a different issue to that which concerns the discount which should be allowed because of the utilitarian benefit of a plea of guilty. 49 Usually a plea of guilty on the day a trial is due to start leads to a discount in the order of 10% but in this case I propose to allow a little more, about 15%, because the issue to be run at trial was always to be a fairly limited one with there being no dispute as to many issues in the Crown case. That attitude by the offender did have a utilitarian benefit in the way the Crown prepared its case and in the time that the Court had to set aside for the trial.50 Before I leave this topic I wish to say something about the approach of the Crown to submissions concerning the issue of the discount for pleading guilty. In submissions from Ms Davenport on this issue, she predicted that the Crown would not speak in opposition to a discount of 20%. She was proved correct. The Crown, in his submissions said that he did not agree with the suggestion that the discount would be 20% but did not wish to be heard further on the issue. When I pressed him, the Crown sought a short adjournment and upon the court resuming he said this: “consistent with what I told my learned friend, and perhaps not what your Honour wants to hear, I do not intend to make any further submissions”.51 I gather from what both Counsel told me that it had been agreed between them that the Crown would not argue against a discount of 20% to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. Ms Davenport clearly had the best interests of her client in mind when she reached that apparent agreement with the Crown prosecutor. But it is an agreement which the Crown prosecutor should never have entered into, as it is, in effect, an agreement not to assist the Court by reference to binding principles and authorities. To that extent the agreement was inconsistent with the Crown prosecutor’s obligations to the Court.52 Crown prosecutors have been the subject of criticism from time to time, whether it be as a result of accepting pleas to manslaughter (see R v Maxwell (1994) 34 NSWLR 606) in cross examining an accused (see Liebke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30,) in final address (R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 487, R v Rugori [2001] NSWCCA 64, R v MM (2003) 145 A Crim R 148, R v Livermore (2006) 67 NSWLR 659) and in the calling of witnesses (see R v Kneebone 47 NSWLR 450). Similar criticisms have been made overseas as well (see Boucher v The Queen (1954) 111 CCC 263) It is no part of a Crown prosecutor’s function to reach an agreement with counsel for an accused that the Crown prosecutor will not assist a judge. It is inappropriate for a Crown prosecutor to decline to refer a judge to relevant principles and authorities, particularly so where those principles and authority might be necessary to correct a submission made by opposing counsel, simply because of an agreement that the Crown prosecutor has reached with counsel for the accused. Special Circumstances53 Ms Davenport asked that I find special circumstances. There were two main reasons she said that I should do this. The first was that this was the first time that the offender has served a sentence of imprisonment, whilst the second is that because of his medical condition the offender needs to be close to a hospital which means that he is incarcerated at a location with limited access to courses and rehabilitation facilities. 54 Whilst the fact that this is the first occasion where the offender has spent time in prison is capable of amounting to special circumstances, it does not follow that special circumstances are automatically found. And in relation to the offender’s present custodial situation, the evidence suggested that, whilst perhaps not as good as the general prison population, the offender does have access to such things as alcohol and other drug rehabilitation services as he requires them. 55 I have declined to find special circumstances for three main reasons: Firstly the evidence suggests that, whilst not perfect, the offender does have access to services which would promote his rehabilitation even in the place where he is presently incarcerated: Secondly the sentence imposed upon the offender must necessarily be lengthy and an application of the statutory ratio results in a proportionally lengthy period of eligibility for parole: and thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the non-parole period I have determined is the least which I consider properly reflects the circumstances of this case.Sentence56 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. The sentence is to have commenced on 24 October 2005, the date of the offender’s arrest. I set a non-parole period of 15 years and a head sentence of 20 years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 23 October 2020.

      SUPPRESSION ORDER – Revoked 14/01/08 by Grove J (Made 14/12/07 by Hidden J: There was to be no publication of the evidence or remarks in these sentence proceedings until the completion of the trial of the co-accused and the further order of this Court.) 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, David Maxwell Shepherd, pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the murder of Malissa Mayfield at Bossley Park on 15 June 2006. He was committed to this Court for sentence and has adhered to that plea. His partner, Angela Wells, has been charged with complicity in the murder and is to face her trial in January 2008. For that reason, I have ordered that there be no publication of the evidence in these proceedings and that order, of course, extends to these remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    2 Although he has pleaded guilty, it is necessary that I resolve a significant dispute about the measure of his culpability for this crime. Before doing so, however, I should set out the facts which are not in dispute. It will be necessary later to examine some aspects of this outline in greater detail. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 At the relevant time, the offender and Ms Wells had been in a relationship for about eighteen months and were living at Blacktown. The deceased, Ms Mayfield, was living at Bossley Park. She and Ms Wells had been friends for some years and, indeed, Ms Wells was godmother to her youngest daughter. It was through his relationship with Ms Wells that the offender came to know the deceased.  
     
      
    4 On an occasion when the offender and Ms Wells were visiting the deceased, the offender told the deceased that he had psychic powers and that he could remove her bad demons by sleeping with her. Ms Wells had also told her that the offender could give her pleasure, and that if she had sex with him all the evil spirits would go. Ms Wells had told a friend of hers that she was interested in having sexual relations with the offender and the deceased at the same time. In the event, the offender had intercourse with the deceased on three or four occasions, as I understand it, at the Blacktown home. Ms Wells was present in the house on those occasions.  
     
      
    5 At other times, the offender would phone the deceased and say to her such things as, “Don’t go to work, you’re going to get killed”, and “Something bad’s going to happen”, and “Someone’s watching you from outside the house”. In January 2006 she told friends of hers that she was trying to avoid the offender and Ms Wells and that she was scared of the offender. She later told one of those friends that she had lost contact with the two of them between February and May of that year. 
     
      
    6 At about 5.30am on Thursday, 15 June 2006, the offender contacted the 000 emergency service to report that he had found the deceased unconscious at her Bossley Park home. He requested an ambulance and said that he was performing CPR on her. Ambulance officers arrived at the house, to find the deceased apparently in cardiac arrest. They noted some bruising around her neck and her eyes. They performed CPR and administered adrenalin, resulting in the output of a heartbeat and pulse.  
     
      
    7 Both the offender and Ms Wells were at the house. They told the ambulance officers that they had gone there out of concern for the deceased, because she had earlier phoned them to say that she was scared as she thought she heard someone outside the house. When they arrived, they were eventually admitted to the house by the deceased’s 12 year old daughter, who told them that her mother was asleep on the lounge room floor. It was obvious to them that the deceased was not asleep. Hence the 000 call. Later that morning, the offender gave the same account to a police officer.  
     
      
    8 The deceased was taken to hospital, where she remained on life support for several days. However, on 19 June the life support machinery was switched off and her life was pronounced extinct a short time later. Bruising and other injuries consistent with manual strangulation had been observed at the hospital, and a subsequent post mortem examination confirmed that that had been the cause of death.  
     
      
    9 Later still on 15 June, the offender and Ms Wells went to a police station to provide written statements. Yet again, the offender maintained the account he had given to the ambulance officers, as he did on the following day in a walk through interview at the deceased’s home. During the evening of 15 June, pursuant to a warrant, police installed listening devices in the Blacktown home. Some conversations between the offender and Ms Wells were recorded in which he made statements of an incriminating nature. Police enquiries continued, including a search of the Blacktown home, and on 3 July 2006 he was arrested. 
     
      
    10 That night he took part in an electronically recorded interview with police, in which his account of the events of 15 June changed dramatically. This was the first of three interviews. All of them were very lengthy but a brief summary of each of them will suffice.  
     
      
    11 In the first interview, he told police that for many years he had heard “voices” inside his head. Strangely, he claimed that one of those voices was also heard by Ms Wells, who called it “Johnny”. He said that over a period of time he grew close to the deceased and confided in her. He told her that his estranged wife had previously accused him of sexual interference with their teenage daughter. He also said that he was expecting to come into a significant amount of money. The deceased was pressuring him to provide her with the money to buy a new car, suggesting that, if he did not, she would tell Ms Wells that he was showing a sexual interest in her 12 year old daughter. This upset him and he told her that he did not want to see her again. 
     
      
    12 He went on to say that he thought that Ms Wells was aware that the deceased intended to make up a story about her daughter to get money out of him, although she did not say so. However that may be, on the night of 14 to 15 June Ms Wells told him that she had heard the voice of “Johnny” speaking about the deceased, and that he had to “sort her out” so that she did not interfere with them again. She said that he had to “fix up” the deceased and her daughter. He understood that to mean that the deceased was to be “bashed or hurt in some way”. He said that he could not hurt her, but that he would talk to her and make sure that she was not in their life again. 
     
      
    13 He described their driving to the vicinity of the deceased’s home, and his ringing her from a public phone on the way to let her know he was coming. He said that he entered the home alone, and that he told the deceased that Ms Wells knew about her demanding money from him and that she wanted him to stop her. The deceased emerged from the kitchen with a knife and said, “You won’t stop me”. The effect of what he told police was that he had no clear memory of what happened then. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        I didn’t know what to do. I just went blank. I heard her on the ground. At first I saw my hand on her hand, the knife was on the ground, it had come out, but I had my hand on her neck and I wasn’t looking at her, I was looking at me like it was outside. 
        
       
      
    14 He said that he told her he was sorry but that she shouldn’t have come at him with the knife. He put the knife into a kitchen drawer. She kept looking at him and moving her head. He panicked and left the house. He said that he did not want to hurt her. He said to her that “Johnny” had told Ms Wells that she needed fixing up but that he did not want to do that. He just wanted her to leave him and Ms Wells alone.  
     
      
    15 Finally, he said that after he left the deceased’s home Ms Wells picked him up. He told her that he did not know what he had done but that the deceased was moving when he left. They repaired to their home but he said that they would have to go back. They returned to the deceased’s home, and he maintained his earlier account of what happened thereafter. He said that he “genuinely tried” to help the deceased. 
     
      
    16 Following that interview, the offender was charged with murder and he has been in custody since that day. On 23 July 2006, at his own request, he took part in a further interview. On this occasion, he said that Ms Wells had woken him in the small hours of 15 June to say that his voices had spoken to her, telling her that they had to “deal with” Malissa and her daughter because they were sending demons to hurt them. He told Ms Wells that he didn’t want to do this, but she was insistent. In the course of the journey to the deceased’s home, she said that “Johnny” had told her that both the deceased and her daughter had to be raped and murdered. This, he said, made him feel sick and he wanted to warn the deceased.  
     
      
    17 According to him, it was Ms Wells who drove him to a public telephone box to call the deceased, so that the call could not be traced to her mobile phone. He was to tell the deceased that he and Ms Wells had fought and that he needed somewhere to stay. He rang the deceased, saying that he needed to tell her something urgently and asking if he could come round to her place. She agreed and the phone cut out. Ms Wells drove him to the vicinity of the deceased’s home, where he got out. Before he did so, Ms Wells received a call from the deceased on her mobile phone. She told the deceased that she and the offender had fought and asked her to put him up if he came around. He also said that he was wearing a football jersey, which Ms Wells told him to take off before he went to the house. She put it in a plastic bag and later threw it into scrubland.  
     
      
    18 He went on to say that he entered the deceased’s home and told her what had happened. She became scared but he assured her that he was not there to hurt her. She took a knife from the breakfast bar, apparently convinced that he did intend to harm her. He said, “The next thing I know I’m holding her here and I’ve got my hand on her wrist and the knife’s on the ground”. He then repeated his earlier account of putting the knife in a drawer and leaving the premises. He heard her say something like, “Tell Angela to go to fucking hell”. He told the police that he did not want to hurt the deceased, as he was in love with her and, indeed, had hoped to leave Ms Wells and move in with her. 
     
      
    19 He said that, while driving home, he told Ms Wells that he could not do what she had wanted him to do. He said that he thought the deceased might report his assault to the police, that he wanted to go back to see if she was alright, to talk to her and, if police had arrived, to explain to them what had happened.  
     
      
    20 He sought to cast the blame for the death of the deceased onto Ms Wells. He said that, on their return to the deceased’s house, he noticed that she was lying in a different position on the floor and was wearing different pants. He kept telling Ms Wells that they had to do CPR, but Ms Wells shook her head. He asked Ms Wells to dial 000 but she said that she could not “work the phone”, so he used the mobile phone. He also said that later, after the deceased died, he said to Ms Wells that he could not see how he had done anything to cause her death. To this, he claimed, Ms Wells said, “Don’t worry about it, I did what you couldn’t do”.  
     
      
    21 He also told police that, three or four days after the incident, Ms Wells directed him to a park near the deceased’s home. There he retrieved a black bag, which he thought belonged to Ms Wells. Inside it was a green handbag. The two of them drove to McDonalds at Blacktown, where Ms Wells emptied the contents of the black bag into a rubbish bin. Some bobby pins fell onto the roadway as she did so. He said that, at Ms Wells’ direction, he threw the two bags into a drain.  
     
      
    22 On 27 July, he took police to various locations in the Blacktown area, and the green handbag and wallet belonging to the deceased were located in a drain. The significance of this is that on 15 June ambulance officers wished to locate the deceased’s Medicare card, but her handbag could not be found. I shall refer later to a submission by the Crown prosecutor about this evidence. Police also found some hair clips and bobby pins in the McDonalds’ car park, and CCTV footage showed Ms Wells walking into and out of McDonalds at around the time he said the items had been put into the rubbish bin. At another location police recovered a football jersey which, according to him, was the one disposed of by Ms Wells. 
     
      
    23 The third interview took place on 4 August 2006, again at the offender’s request. It was his account of events in this interview which his counsel advanced as his case for the purpose of sentence. That account was similar to that which he had given in the second interview in broad outline, but there were significant differences. Most importantly, on this occasion he admitted responsibility for the death of the deceased. 
     
      
    24 He said that, for at least a month before the murder, Ms Wells was telling him that his voices demanded that the deceased and her daughter be “dealt with and .. gotten rid of”. She said that they would never be together if they didn’t do this. He said that on the night in question Ms Wells woke him and told him that his voices said that it had to happen “right now”. The deceased and her daughter had to be raped and killed, or they would send more demons to him. He agreed to go to the deceased’s home, but repeated that he had no intention of doing what Ms Wells had asked of him.  
     
      
    25 He said that, after the call to the deceased on the public phone, he said to Ms Wells, “Let’s go home, it’s no good”. Ms Wells’ mobile phone rang but she did not answer it. It rang a second time, and she answered it and spoke to the deceased. She “made up a story” that she had run into an old boyfriend, she and the offender had had a fight, and he had got out of the car. She asked the deceased to put him up for the night if he turned up at her home.  
     
      
    26 After that phone conversation, he said, he got out of the car and walked to the deceased’s home. When he got there the deceased was confused, but she seemed happy to see him and was affectionate towards him. She asked him about the fight which Ms Wells had recounted, and he said that there had not been a fight and that it was a “bullshit story” that she had made up. He started to tell her what Ms Wells really wanted him to do. She became enraged, and came at him with a knife. He pushed her down, seized the knife, and put it back in the drawer. He apologised to her and left.  
     
      
    27 A few minutes later, he said, he went back to the house. The deceased had changed her clothes and she was holding the phone. She told him that she was going to ring Ms Wells and was going “to tell Angie what I think”. He continued: 
     
      
       
        
        The next thing I know I’m on top of Malissa and my hands are around her throat. I don’t know why, I just couldn’t let go, I don’t know why, the fear of her ringing Angie and getting into trouble. I don’t know how long I was there. I don’t remember whether she was moving or not when I left. I remember a feeling of numbness. I just didn’t, I didn’t want it to happen. The voices were so loud, the thought of Angie going crook at me. I just left. 
        
       
      
    28 He explained that his fear in relation to Ms Wells was of her going “off her head” and leaving him. As to the voices, he said that while he had his hands around the deceased’s neck he could hear voices screaming at him, “Do it, do it”. Questioned about the detail of his actions, he said that he had both hands around the deceased’s neck and that he “couldn’t stop”. He said that he was squeezing “hard”, and that he had his hands around her throat until she stopped moving. He thought that she was dead.  
     
      
    29 He left the house, and walked for a considerable time before Ms Wells picked him up. He continued to hear voices, screaming at him to run. He said that he was seeing demons and ghosts, “bad ones” which were teasing him.  
     
      
    30 He said that, when they got home, he felt that he could not leave the deceased as she was. Both of them panicked and returned to the house. After a time they were admitted by the deceased’s daughter. The deceased had what he could only describe as “the death shakes”. Ms Wells “freaked out” and took the daughter to her bedroom. She came back out and made gestures to convey that he should “finish the job”. He initially said that he put his hands around the deceased’s throat again and squeezed it. He later said that he did not squeeze her throat because “there was no point to it”. As he did this, he said, Ms Wells stood in the hallway, watching, because “there was no point talking ‘cause she was already gone”.  
     
      
    31 It was then, he said, that he “took control”. He phoned the emergency number and spoke to “the ambulance people”. He told the police that he did not know why he had done what he did. He said, “It’s, like, 9 months of my life’s been taken from me and screwed up”. He added that, after the deceased was taken to the hospital, he and Ms Wells made up their initial story about their having gone to the deceased’s home after she had called them about an intruder in her yard. He said that he had no recollection of taking any handbag from the house. 
     
      
    32 The officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Sergeant Hinds, gave evidence in the sentence proceedings. Among other things, he said that the deceased’s daughter had been interviewed. She confirmed that she had not been touched inappropriately by the offender, and she said that the first she saw of him on the morning of 15 June was when she gave him and Ms Wells access to the home on the occasion that the ambulance officers arrived. Detective Hinds said that the deceased had been examined at the hospital by a doctor specialising in examination for sexual assault, that swabs had been taken from her, and that no semen was detected upon them when examined by a forensic biologist. He also said that, when the deceased’s house was searched on 15 June and on subsequent occasions, items were found consistent with an interest by her in the supernatural. 
     
      
       
      The dispute 
       
      
    33 The offender did not give evidence himself and produced no other evidence. His counsel, Ms Rigg, presented his case through a careful analysis of the material in the Crown case. Of course, much of his account in the three interviews after his arrest is bizarre, conveying a belief in the demonic and referring to the hearing of voices, both before and at the time of the murder. Nevertheless, Ms Rigg acknowledged the absence of any psychiatric evidence dealing with this material. She argued that it was relevant by way of background to the offence, but she disavowed any claim that he suffered from mental illness causally connected to his behaviour or bearing upon considerations of deterrence. Equally, she made no claim that his conditions of custody had been more onerous because of any mental illness. He told police in the third interview that he had had a lot to drink and had smoked marihuana on the night in question, but neither Ms Rigg nor the Crown prosecutor suggested that this had any bearing upon his culpability. 
     
      
    34 Clearly, he pleaded guilty upon the basis that he had strangled the deceased intending to kill her or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. The central area of dispute is whether the killing was premeditated. The Crown prosecutor argued that it was, and that the offender’s description of a spontaneous attack should be rejected. He acknowledged that, in large part, the only evidence of what occurred at the deceased’s home was that which fell from the mouth of the offender, but he pointed to the obvious inconsistencies between his various accounts and submitted that none of them, including the third interview, is reliable. It was his case that from the whole of the material the inference of premeditation could, and should, be drawn.  
     
      
    35 Thus, the Crown prosecutor’s primary submission was that the offender had resolved to kill the deceased before he set out for her home. It may well be, he said, that the deceased produced a knife after the offender arrived but, most likely, that was because he had made his intention known and she was trying to protect herself and, perhaps, her daughter. His fallback position was that the offender formed the intention to kill her when he arrived at the house. In either event, he argued, the offender went to the house a second time not to help the deceased but to make sure that she was dead.  
     
      
    36 In support of his primary submission, the Crown prosecutor noted that the offender admitted that there had been discussion with Ms Wells about killing the deceased before they set out for her home. However, he also relied on other evidence which was said to support the inference that the offence was planned. This was the evidence concerning the telephone calls of the morning of 15 June. 
     
      
    37 I have earlier set out the offender’s account of the phone calls made and received in the early hours of 15 June on the journey to the deceased’s home. It will be remembered that he told police that Ms Wells had him call the deceased from a public phone so that the call could not be traced to her mobile phone. Police inquiries revealed that in the early hours of that morning calls were made to the deceased’s mobile from a public phone in the relevant area. It is also apparent that the offender had his own mobile phone at the time. Call charge records disclosed the following: 
     
      
       
      (1) At 1.18am a call was made from the public telephone to the deceased’s mobile, lasting one minute and 20 seconds. 
       
       
      (2) At 1.21am a second call was made from the same public phone to the same mobile, lasting 7 seconds.  
       
       
      (3) At 1.22am a call was made from the deceased’s phone to the offender’s mobile, lasting 2 seconds. 
       
       
      (4) At 1.28am a call was made from the deceased’s phone to Ms Wells’ mobile, lasting 5 seconds. 
       
       
      (5) At 1.29am another call was made from the deceased’s phone to Ms Wells’ mobile, on this occasion lasting 10 minutes and 27 seconds. 
       
       
      (6) At 4.05am a call was made from the offender’s landline phone to the deceased’s mobile, which was not answered.  
       
      
    38 Why there were two calls from the public phone is not clear, but nothing turns on it. It may be that the second very short call was an attempt by the offender to contact the deceased again after her phone cut out the first time. However that may be, the Crown prosecutor placed significance upon the fact that the offender was in a public telephone box, out of the hearing of Ms Wells. It is the offender’s case that he went to the deceased’s home with Ms Wells, knowing that she wanted him to kill the deceased and her daughter but having no intention of doing so. If that were so, said the Crown prosecutor, he had the opportunity then to warn the deceased but, on his own account, he did not. 
     
      
    39 In truth, the Crown prosecutor argued, he also was concerned that calls could not be traced either to his mobile or Ms Wells’. This was said to explain the third call, the call from the deceased’s mobile to his, which must have been immediately after his calls from the public phone. It is recorded as lasting only 2 seconds. This suggests, said the Crown prosecutor, that he did not answer the call. He saw from the screen of his mobile that it was coming from the deceased and he immediately terminated it.  
     
      
    40 Unfortunately for him, the argument continued, minutes later the deceased rang Ms Wells’ mobile twice, these being the fourth and fifth recorded calls. The fourth call lasted only 5 seconds but the fifth call was quite lengthy, continuing for more than 10 minutes. Presumably, that was the call during which, according to the offender, Ms Wells told the deceased that she and he had had a falling out. By then, said the Crown prosecutor, the offender’s desire that no calls be made which could be traced to either mobile phone was clearly frustrated. It became necessary to concoct an innocent explanation for them. This, he argued, influenced the initial “cover story” which he and Ms Wells told to the ambulance officers and to police on 15 June. It will be necessary to examine that account in a little more detail.  
     
      
    41 As I have said, the effect of the story was that they had gone to the deceased’s home a little before 5.00am in response to a call from her to say that she thought there was an intruder outside the house, and that, upon arriving there, they found her unconscious on the lounge room floor and raised the alarm. What they said was that the deceased had called Ms Wells’ mobile at about 1.30am to report her fear of an intruder. She said that she was going outside to investigate and would ring them back shortly. They fell asleep and woke at about 4.00am, realising that she had not rung back. They called her home phone but the call was unanswered. It was then that they set off to her house. 
     
      
    42 The purpose of this aspect of the cover story, the Crown prosecutor argued, was to provide an innocent explanation for the deceased’s contacting Ms Wells’ mobile at or about 1.30am, the time at which the fourth and fifth recorded calls were made. The cover story must have been conceived between that time and about 4.00am, because it was at 4.05am that the sixth recorded call, the unanswered call from their landline to the deceased’s mobile, was made. This call, said the Crown prosecutor, was part of the cover story. It was not expected that the call would be answered because at that time they believed that the deceased was dead. The same is true of three further unanswered calls made after 5.00am from Ms Wells’ mobile to the deceased’s landline, which were picked up by a telecommunications tower at Bossley Park. These also, argued the Crown prosecutor, were for the purpose of covering their tracks and deflecting suspicion away from themselves. 
     
      
    43 The Crown prosecutor’s alternative submission was that the offender formed the intention to kill the deceased after he arrived at her home. For this he relied upon the offender’s description in the third interview of the manner in which he strangled her, squeezing her throat until she stopped moving. The Crown prosecutor added that, on this view of the facts, it is unclear why the offender attacked the deceased and I could arrive at no firm finding about that matter. Ms Rigg contended that the attack was spontaneous and that I could be satisfied of no more than an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. She also argued that the offender regretted what he had done, and that he returned to the house with a genuine desire to help the deceased. 
     
      
    44 Let me turn to the Crown prosecutor’s submissions about that last matter. As I have said, his position was that the return to the deceased’s house was for the purpose of ensuring that she was dead and that the offender did squeeze her throat on that occasion for that very purpose. The 000 call, he said, was no more than part of the cover story. A recording and a transcript of that call are in evidence. For the most part it records a conversation between the offender and the 000 operator, but at times Ms Wells is heard to speak. From what is said, it is apparent that they had already conceived the cover story.  
     
      
    45 The Crown prosecutor relied upon the three calls made from Ms Wells’ mobile to the deceased’s landline after 5.00am, apparently in the Bossley Park area where the deceased lived. The call charge records disclosed that they were made at 5.12, 5.15 and 5.16, but the call to the 000 line from the offender’s mobile was not made until 5.27. He argued that the apparent delay between their arriving in the area and making the 000 call confirms that it was a sham. There is no doubt that, when speaking to the 000 operator, the offender sounds distressed and in a state of panic. He is heard to tell the operator that he is familiar with CPR and is performing it upon the deceased. However, the Crown prosecutor pointed out that it is only towards the end of the call, which lasted for some minutes, that he is heard to be counting compressions of the deceased’s chest and sounds to be exerting himself for that purpose. At that time the operator had told him that ambulance officers were about to arrive at the house. He was concerned, said the Crown prosecutor, to ensure that he was seen by those officers to be performing CPR. 
     
      
    46 Another aspect of the cover up, the Crown prosecutor submitted, was the theft and disposal of the deceased’s handbag. This was to make it appear that she had been killed after she disturbed an intruder who had got into the house to steal property. He argued that I should find that it was the offender who took the bag from the house after he strangled the deceased, and that it was he who disposed of it.  
     
      
    47 Ms Rigg acknowledged the falsity of the offender’s cover story on 15 June. She also acknowledged the obvious inconsistencies between his versions of events in the three recorded interviews. However, she noted certain aspects of his account which were consistent: firstly, that it was Ms Wells who wanted to harm the deceased; secondly, that he maintained the pretence of co-operating with Ms Wells but had no intention to harm her; thirdly, that his attack upon her was spontaneous and not in pursuance of any plan conceived with Ms Wells; fourthly, that he returned to the deceased’s home out of concern for her, not to ensure that she was dead. 
     
      
    48 Ms Rigg argued that I should accept the offender’s account of Ms Wells’ hearing voices and fearing demons, putting this forward, as I have said, as the background to what occurred. In support of it, she relied upon the evidence that the offender, Ms Wells and the deceased shared an interest in the occult: one which, she said, was furthered by Ms Wells. That shared interest developed, as she put it, to “a level of hysteria”, and the deceased took steps to remove herself from it.  
     
      
    49 In my recital of the undisputed facts, I have recounted a souring of their relationship to the extent that the deceased became afraid of the offender and lost contact with him and Ms Wells for some months. Ms Rigg pointed out that that was based upon the untested statements of friends of the deceased about what she had told them, that those statements were unlikely to present the whole picture of the interaction between the two of them, and that I should not reject the offender’s assertion to police that he remained attached to the deceased and wanted to forge a relationship with her. That being so, she said, it is unlikely that he would have planned to harm her and, having attacked her in the heat of the moment, it is probable that he wanted to help her survive. 
     
      
    50 On the primary issue of premeditation, Ms Rigg developed her submissions through a detailed examination of the evidence. This included consideration of the evidence relating to the recorded telephone calls, leading to an argument that they were not inconsistent with the offender’s case. In particular, it was put that his call to the deceased from the public phone was adequately explained by the circumstances as he recounted them to the police and did not point to his complicity in a plan to kill her. She also noted that the offender did not use a weapon and argued that, if he had set off for the deceased’s home bent upon killing her, it is highly improbable that he would have been armed with nothing but his bare hands. 
     
      
    51 I am indebted to Ms Rigg and to the Crown prosecutor for their careful analysis of the evidence. However, I need not recite any further Ms Riggs’ submissions on the question of premeditation. This is, of course, a crucial issue for the purpose of sentence and I have taken time to reflect upon it. On the significance of the phone calls, the Crown prosecutor did not produce any expert evidence about the transmission of calls from landlines or mobiles or about the compilation of call charge records. Nevertheless, his arguments about the calls are plausible. Generally, the case he presented on premeditation was well reasoned and the scenario for which he contended is consistent with the evidence and entirely possible.  
     
      
    52 On the other hand, he acknowledged the lack of any satisfactory evidence of a motive for a premeditated killing. He did not rely upon the motive suggested in the first recorded interview, that is, that the deceased was effectively blackmailing the offender. Equally, he argued that I would not accept the offender’s assertions in the second and third interviews about the influence of voices and the fear of demons. In particular, he described the proposition that Ms Wells was hearing the offender’s voices as “just nonsense”. It is trite that a premeditated killing might be established in the absence of satisfactory evidence of motive, but in a case such as this the significance of a motive cannot be denied. 
     
      
    53 The evidence in the present case is unsatisfactory and in significant respects conflicting. Premeditation is a matter which the Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt. While there is room for considerable suspicion, I am not satisfied that it has been made out.  
     
      
    54 If I had been, it would have been necessary to deal with submissions about whether, and, if so, to what extent, the killing was the product of the malign influence of Ms Wells. That is not a matter about which I need make any finding. As I have said, the question whether Ms Wells bears any criminal responsibility for the murder is yet to be tried. I should say at this point that I considered whether these sentence proceedings should be stood over until after that trial, so that, if Ms Wells were found guilty, the two of them could be sentenced by the same judge. The Crown prosecutor raised that matter but did not press such an application, as an application for an adjournment had earlier been refused by Barr J. Ms Riggs’ position was that the matter should proceed, and I decided that that was the appropriate course. The sentencing of the offender turns largely upon evidence admissible only against him, and I anticipate that Ms Wells, if she were found guilty, would be sentenced upon a different evidentiary basis.  
     
      
    55 That brings me, then, to the offender’s state of mind at the time of the killing. I have given this matter careful thought also, and have concluded that the Crown prosecutor’s alternative submission must be accepted. Given the offender’s description of his strangling the deceased and, in particular, of his squeezing her throat until she stopped moving, I am satisfied to the requisite degree that he did intend to kill her. Nevertheless, I accept that he did so spontaneously and in the heat of the moment.  
     
      
    56 It may well be that the background to this incident is to be found in some bizarre interest in the supernatural which these three people shared. Nevertheless, I can make no firm finding about why the offender went to the deceased’s house that morning, or about what it was which triggered his attack upon her. There is inconsistency in his account of the circumstances of that attack between the first and second interviews, on the one hand, and the third interview, on the other. Whether the deceased produced a knife or was holding her phone, about to ring Ms Wells, I cannot say. I can say no more than that the offender is to be sentenced for the murder on the basis that it was spontaneous.  
     
      
    57 The question whether he returned to the house to help the deceased was agitated primarily on the issue of premeditation. However, Ms Rigg dealt with it also as a matter going to the objective gravity of the offence. The evidence on this issue is as conflicting as it is on the other aspects of the case. On any view of it, what occurred after his return to the house was, at least in part, in pursuance of the cover story. Some of the evidence points to his having gone back there to ensure that the deceased was dead, although on that point Ms Rigg relied on statements by him in the third interview to the effect that he squeezed the deceased’s throat on that occasion only lightly, with a view to satisfying Ms Wells. I have referred to other statements in that interview conveying that he believed that the deceased was already dead or, at least, so close to death as to be beyond help. I have also summarised the evidence about the 000 call and the Crown prosecutor’s submission in relation to it. In doing so, I noted that the offender does sound genuinely distressed during that call. If it were a sham, it certainly was, to use the Crown prosecutor’s expression, “a class A performance”. As to the delay between his arrival in the Bossley Park area and the 000 call, Ms Rigg relied on his account that it took some time to rouse the deceased’s daughter and gain access to the house. 
     
      
    58 Having considered all the material concerning the offender’s return to the house, I can arrive at no finding about it, one way or the other. I am not persuaded that he went back to ensure that the deceased was dead. The proposition that he returned there with a genuine desire to help her is a matter in mitigation, as to which he bears the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities. I am not persuaded of that either. For the purpose of sentence, I put aside the evidence on this aspect.  
     
      
    59 In arriving at these conclusions, I have not overlooked the material bearing upon the relationship between the offender and the deceased. On the whole of that material, it seems clear enough that at the relevant time she wanted nothing to do with him. It may be that he retained an affection for her, but I can make no finding about that matter either. Nor, on the question of premeditation, have I overlooked the cover story and the fact, which I accept, that the deceased’s handbag was removed and disposed of to make it appear that it was an intruder who had killed her. However, it is the experience of this Court that, not infrequently, elaborate steps are taken to cover up a killing which was spontaneous. 
     
      
       
      Victim impact statements 
       
      
    60 I received victim impact statements from Ms Mayfield’s parents, her step-sister, and a former partner, the father of one of her children. Those statements express eloquently their outrage, grief and sense of loss following her brutal and untimely death. They also express the serious and enduring effects which this tragedy has had upon their lives. The heart of any right thinking member of this community must go out to all of them. They have my deepest sympathy.  
     
      
    61 The Court’s approach to victim impact statements in a case of this kind has been guided for some years by the decision in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. The Crown prosecutor submitted that I should reconsider that approach in the light of subsequent legislative developments, referring to R v Lewis [2001] NSWCCA 448. In response, Ms Rigg referred to subsequent cases, including R v Tzanis [2005] NSWCCA 274, in which a bench of five sat with a view to re-examining the approach to this issue but, in the event, decided that the case was not an appropriate vehicle to do so. I would certainly not attempt to do so in the present case, and I see no reason to depart from the approach sanctioned in Previtera. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing 
       
      
    62 The offender presented no subjective case. The little I know about him is what emerges from the material in the Crown case. That includes his criminal history, which comprises one old entry for an apparently minor offence of dishonesty, which is of no present significance. He was 36 years old at the time of the offence and is now 38. The Crown prosecutor properly raised the question whether the offence demonstrates that he is a danger to the community, so that emphasis should be placed upon the protection of society in determining the appropriate sentence. That would be an easier question to answer if I knew more about his background and psychological make-up. However, in the light of my findings, this is a not unfamiliar case of a spontaneous killing, although the circumstances giving rise to it are obscure. There is nothing in his criminal history to suggest violence in the past, and there appears to be no reason to fear that he might commit such an offence again. As best I can judge it, he should have reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    63 The crime of murder carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 20 years. It has never been suggested that this offence calls for the maximum sentence and, in the light of my findings, it clearly does not. The standard non-parole period is reserved for offences falling into the mid range of objective gravity. I consider that this offence falls short of that range, although it is close to it. In any event, there are other reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period, particularly the offender’s early plea of guilty.  
     
      
    64 That plea has considerable utilitarian value. It averted what would have been a lengthy trial, in which it may have been necessary for the Crown to call the deceased’s daughter. The plea also represents an early acknowledgement of criminal responsibility by the offender, and is some evidence of his remorse. That said, I remain guarded about the extent to which he is contrite. He has not expressed contrition in this Court, the Crown case against him was undoubtedly strong and, as is apparent, I am far from persuaded that he told police the whole truth about this matter.  
     
      
    65 Ms Rigg made no submission about special circumstances. No doubt, the offender, a man with no criminal history of significance required to serve his first term of imprisonment, and a lengthy one at that, would benefit from the opportunity for release into the community for an extended period under supervision and subject to the sanction of parole. However, the sentence I must impose is such that that end would be achieved by the application of the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. Further, I do not believe that any lesser non-parole period than that which I propose would be sufficient to reflect considerations of retribution and deterrence. But for his plea of guilty, I would have imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 24 years. In recognition of the utilitarian value of his plea, I will reduce that to 19 years, a discount of roughly 20 percent. I will fix a non-parole period of 15 years. The sentence will date from 3 July 2006, and he will be eligible for release on parole on 2 July 2021.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J:  This is an appeal against conviction following a trial before O’Reilly ADCJ and a jury at Penrith District Court. The indictment charged two counts of sexual intercourse with a child aged between ten and sixteen years, two counts of homosexual intercourse with a male aged between ten and eighteen years and two counts of aggravated indecent assault. The appellant was found guilty on all counts and was sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    2 The complainant, whom I will refer to from time to time as M, was a school pupil. The appellant was a youth pastor at the Blue Mountains City Church. They first encountered each other when M was delivering pamphlets in the area where the appellant and he then lived. M would visit on occasions and they would talk and sometimes the appellant provided him with something to drink. These encounters were entirely innocent. M and his family moved from the area and the contact diminished but subsequently the appellant also moved and came to occupy a house about five minutes walk from where M resided. Considerable contact between them was made by text messaging on mobile telephones. M was involved in an incident referred to at trial as the Thomas Park incident. He had apparently been sexually interfered with by a group of young males. What was involved in the incident was not disclosed to the jury but he gave evidence that he told the appellant about it in a text message. The appellant responded that he could “come over” and M went to his home, dressed in his pyjamas. Whilst M was at the house the offences charged in counts 1 and 5 took place. 
     
      
    3 A couple of weeks later they were again exchanging text messages and M went to the house again. What was charged in counts 2 and 3 occurred that night.  
     
      
    4 After a further couple of weeks more messages were being exchanged and M advised that he was reading a magazine entitled “Men’s Health” and he had read something funny. The appellant requested him to show him the magazine and M again went to the house where the incidents charged as counts 4 and 6 occurred.  
     
      
    5 It is not necessary for present purposes to detail the conduct of the appellant which constituted the charges. It suffices to note that it included homosexual intercourse, digital anal penetration, masturbation of M and what was described as smacking, licking and biting his bottom. 
     
      
    6 The ground of appeal is that the verdict of the jury on each count is unreasonable having regard to the evidence. The notice of grounds of appeal filed by the appellant elaborates this ground: 
     
      
       
        
        “The verdicts are unreasonable particularly having regard to the following features of the case: 
        
       
       
        
        i. The terms of each of the six counts in the indictment presented against the appellant alleged that he had committed a sexual offence against the complainant in the period between 9 June 2000 and 28 February 2001. The evidence of the complainant expressly denies that any offences occurred in this time period and there is no reliable evidence of any kind that any offences did occur in that time period. 
        
       
       
        
        ii. It was conceded by the Crown and the jury were directed in terms that the direct evidence available in the prosecution case depended entirely on the evidence of the complainant, see summing up at 9.3, 11 September 2006. There are such significant inconsistencies in the version of events given by the complainant that his evidence alone is insufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant is guilty of any of the offences specified in the six counts of the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        iii. The appellant established through his own evidence and the evidence of the witnesses called in his case that he is a person of good character. There was no direct evidence called in the prosecution case or anything in the cross examination of the appellant, or in the cross examination of any of the witnesses called on his behalf, which disproved the appellant’s account denying that he had committed the offences charged against him.” 
        
       
      
    7 As can be deduced from what appears above, it was the Crown case that the offences occurred over a span of approximately six weeks. In cross examination M agreed that afterwards there was some continued text message exchange but the subject of the incidents was not raised and thereafter he did not have “much to do” with the appellant.  
     
      
    8 The argument on appeal centred upon the inconsistency between the evidence of M as to the times at which the offences took place and the span of time alleged in the indictment. Mr Byrne SC (who did not appear at trial) for the appellant, supplied a list of authorities concerning occasions when the dates in an indictment may or may not become a material matter, but at the trial in this instance time was expressly made of the essence and the learned trial judge directed the jury in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that anything that occurred occurred within that period, 9 June 2000 and 28 February 2001, the appropriate verdict is not guilty.” 
        
       
      
    9 The dates referred to were those specified in each of the counts of the indictment presented at trial. The later date was M’s sixteenth birthday. 
     
      
    10 It was the Crown case that M had a faulty memory in relation to the dates of the offences and it was intended to prove the correct time frame independently of his testimony. In his opening address the Crown Prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: …The charges on the indictment are from 9 June 2000 to 28 February 2001, that’s when the Crown case says these things happened. I expect that (M) will tell you that he thinks that they happened in 1999 and it’s the Crown case that he is mistaken about that date, that it happened in 1999.” 
        
       
      
    11 The Crown Prosecutor then articulated how the Crown proposed to establish the time frame. I shall refer to the evidence as it was called in due course. 
     
      
    12 The appellant had previously been arraigned and presented for trial upon an indictment which charged that the offences occurred between June 1999 and June 2000, those dates being compatible with M’s recollection. The trial aborted and no verdict was taken. Before the current trial leave was sought to amend the indictment by substitution of the dates which I have indicated and the application was granted. The application to amend was expressly unopposed by counsel for the appellant at trial. 
     
      
    13 As the Crown Prosecutor anticipated, M located the offences in 1999. In examination in chief and cross examination he testified about a number of “markers” which he used to establish the year 1999 in his mind. In that year he was in Year 9 at Blaxland High School. It was in the middle of that year, according to his recall, that the Thomas Park incident occurred and the offences by the appellant took place soon after it. In 2000 he was studying for his School Certificate and he said that the sexual assaults did not occur during that year. Also, in about May 2000 he met and formed a relationship with a young girl and there were no sexual assaults against him in that year. 
     
      
    14 Senior Counsel for the appellant specifically drew this Court’s attention to some passages in the testimony of M. They were (in chief): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And you finished high school in year 10, which was in – is that right – in 1999? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, year 10 was in year 2000. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Sorry, in 2000. The night that you went over to Pastor Bryan’s place you told us that it was a weeknight and you told us that you were wearing flannelette pyjamas? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, that’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you able to tell us anything that would tell us what the date was or when it happened? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, I don’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You have said that you were still at Blaxland High School, are you able to say whether it was towards the end of your time in Blaxland High School or was it in the early years when you were in year seven or eight? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It was – I definitely know it wasn’t while I was doing my school certificate which was in 2000, that time I remember.” 
        
       
      
    15 This evidence was followed immediately by this testimony: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You have told us that on this particular night you were sending and receiving text messages? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you receive them on a mobile telephone? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Whose phone was that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It was my phone but it was in my mum’s phone. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What type of phone was it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It was a Nokia 32/10.” (T16) 
        
       
      
    16 I shall return to detail the significance of the use of the particular Nokia mobile phone. Further evidence in chief was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. These three incidents that you’ve told us about, you’ve told us that you turned sixteen on 28 February 2001? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did these three incidents happen before or after your sixteenth birthday? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Before. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you say how long before your sixteenth birthday they happened? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Over a year cause it didn’t happen while I was in year 10 because I had my School Certificate.” (T31) 
        
       
      
    17 And in cross examination: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now what I want to suggest to you is that you never went to the house, as you claimed, when just the accused was alone there, did you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was that in 1999? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I’m not sure when the dates were, I can’t remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well you were going to his home for the Bible Study courses in 1999, weren’t you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. As far as I remember, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And he certainly didn’t do anything to you physically or sexually in the year 2000 did he? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Not that I know of because it was my School Certificate year. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you’ve always remembered, haven’t you, that he didn’t touch you in any way during that year of 2000, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Correct.” (T44) 
        
       
       
      And 
       
       
        
        “Q. Now just going back to the Thomas Park incident in mid 1999, how long after that incident was it you sent a text message or messages to the accused which resulted in you going to his house on the first occasion that you say you were sexually abused? 
        
       
       
        
        A. From what I remember it wasn’t that long. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. A matter of weeks or months? 
        
       
       
        
        A. As far as I remember it was a matter of weeks. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Certainly in 1999? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well as I said, I’m not sure, as far as I can remember. I’ve tried to forget it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. All right, you’ve been trying to forget it, but in any event one thing is completely clear in your mind, isn’t it, that you weren’t sexually abused when you were doing your School Certificate, that year, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, as far as I remember. I have tried to forget it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In fact it was in the year 2000 that you met a girl, wasn’t it-- 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. --in about May, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q, And so there were two distinctive features about the year 2000, weren’t there, there was the fact it was your School Certificate year and you met a girl in the year 2000 in May? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you can search in your memory and certainly, I suggest, say that it wasn’t in that year that the accused sexually abused you, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now I want to put to you that at no time did he sexually abuse you, do you understand? I’m putting to you that on no occasion did he deal with you in an improper or sexual manner. 
        
       
       
        
        A. It’s not true. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Didn’t happen. 
        
       
       
        
        A. That’s not true. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You say it did happen? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And it happened between the Thomas Park incident you say – and when I say ‘it’, the three incidents, correct, happened between the Thomas Park incident and the beginning of the year 2000, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. As far as I remember, yes.” (T51-52) 
        
       
       
      And: 
       
       
        
        “Q. Now if I can go to the third time, as I understand it that’s the occasion when you say there was an exchange of SMS messages between you and the accused concerning the men’s magazine? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where did you get the magazine from? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Just the newsagency. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That was a magazine called Men’s Health was it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You never sent any message on your mobile phone to the accused about that magazine did you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He never sent you a message saying ‘You’ll have to show it to me’? 
        
       
       
        
        A. He did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You never sent him a message on your mobile phone saying ‘I can show it to you now’, did you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What phone did you use? 
        
       
       
        
        A. The 3210. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. To send the messages? I beg your pardon? 
        
       
       
        
        A. A 3210. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you not use the bright orange Alcatel? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At the time of the incident in Thomas Park you had the bright orange Alcatel didn’t you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What phone do you say you had then? 
        
       
       
        
        A. The 3210. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re not telling the jury the truth I suggest about, what do you say about that suggestion of mine? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I am.” (T72) 
        
       
      
    18 M had possession of an orange Alcatel mobile phone prior to having the Nokia phone. In relation to text message by use of the former he had said in chief: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. The text messages that you were receiving and sending, you said you had the 32/10 Nokia mobile phone? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was that the first phone, mobile phone you ever had? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No it wasn’t. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How many phones before that did you have? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I just had the one. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what was that, what type of phone was it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. It was an Alcatel. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you send or receive any text messages on that phone to anyone? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Not many, because I didn’t really know how to work it, it was sort of like a brick, it was – I really only knew how to work out a call and that was about it.” (T17) 
        
       
      
    19 M was cross examined about a statement which he had made to police. The statement itself was not put into evidence. It was put to him and he accepted that therein there was reference to the Thomas Park incident and the following was put and answered: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I am not interested in any other parts. Did you say in that document these words. Please follow me through, I will read the yellow highlighted parts. ‘There was an incident in Thomas Park’. Correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. ‘I can’t remember the exact date but it was about 10 o’clock on a weeknight and my parents had gone bed (sic) early and I had just got my first mobile, it was a bright orange Alcatel and I messaged (the appellant) he was older than me’? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes.” (T82) 
        
       
      
    20 However, further cross examined, M said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And when you said ‘I had just got my first mobile it was a bright orange Alcatel and I messaged (the appellant)’ you meant by that that you had got your first mobile phone, a bright orange Alcatel and you messaged the accused, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That’s what I wrote. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was that true? 
        
       
       
        
        A. At the time that’s what I thought it was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No is that true? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Of what actually happened, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I got my first mobile, it was a bright orange Alcatel and I messaged (the appellant) was that true? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It’s not true? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you didn’t tell the truth there? 
        
       
       
        
        A. In this statement when I read it – wrote it out I had to write it out over night. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You thought about what you were doing, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I thought to the best of my ability. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You don’t suggest your memory now is better than it was then when you wrote that out in 2004 do you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I remember the events better now than I did then. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Sir, you’re not telling the jury the truth about that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Sorry, I didn’t hear you. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You are not telling the jury the truth about that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I am telling the jury the truth. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The phone you had in 1999 was the bright orange Alcatel wasn’t it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re not telling the jury the truth about that are you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I am telling the truth. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The Alcatel was your telephone that you had immediately before you acquired your Nokia 3210, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what you told Pastor Kelly and the detective about having just got your first mobile being a bright orange Alcatel was true wasn’t it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. At the time I thought it was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It was in fact true wasn’t it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. At the time I thought it was true. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And when you saw Pastor Bryan singing at the Christmas pageant in December 1999 you then had your bright orange Alcatel mobile phone didn’t you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Sorry, you turned away from the microphone, I couldn’t hear anything. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I’m sorry, I thought I spoke loud enough for it to carry on, but I will repeat it. When you say you saw Pastor Bryan at the Christmas pageant in 1999, December 1999, you then possessed your bright orange Alcatel didn’t you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re not telling the truth about that are you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I am. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You didn’t get your Nokia 3210 until the 9th of June 2000 did you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I had my Alcatel for like 12 months. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No. concentrate on the point of my question please. You didn’t get your Nokia 3210 until 9 June in the year 2000 did you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I don’t know, I don’t remember the dates of when I got things.” (T82-86) 
        
       
      
    21 There was independent evidence from Ms Frankham an employee of the telephone service provider that the Nokia mobile phone was connected on 9 June 2000 and disconnected on 28 June 2002. The contract was entered into by M’s mother but the phone was used by M. Ms Frankham produced extensive detailed records of the use of that phone and charges made for various services.  
     
      
    22 The extracts from the testimony by M above set out show fluctuations in his degree of confidence about time frame ranging from certainty in his own mind to doubt. The Crown case on the issue of time frame was essentially simple. If it was correct that contact was made between M and the appellant by means of the Nokia telephone at the time of the offences then the offences must have occurred during the span of time that Ms Frankham specified as when the service was operative. There was no challenge to Ms Frankham’s evidence. 
     
      
    23 The records show that between 5 July 2000 and 15 March 2001 there were 476 text messages sent from M’s Nokia phone to a mobile phone shown to be operated by the appellant. During the same period 302 text messages were sent in the reverse direction, that is from the appellant’s phone to M’s Nokia. 
     
      
    24 It is of significance to note that in an electronically recorded interview with police on 30 May 2005 the appellant was asked these questions and gave these responses: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q46 Are you familiar with a (M)? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I know of him, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q47 Can you tell me how well you know him? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I don’t know him well. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q54 Have you ever texted (M)? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q55 Has he ever texted you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Not that I’m aware of, no.” 
        
       
      
    25 It is of further significance that a deliberate decision was made, no doubt bearing in mind the knowledge of what M’s recollection apparently was, to withhold from him the material which was ultimately produced by Ms Frankham. Any suggestion therefore that he was given some assistance or coaching in respect of his evidence was avoided.  
     
      
    26 Counsel for the appellant submitted that there was a critical gap in the Crown case in the absence of evidence of a similar nature to the records concerning the Nokia in respect of the Alcatel phone. There was therefore no evidence, one way or another, independent of the testimony of M recited above, as to whether the Alcatel phone had ever been used for text messages. 
     
      
    27 In the course of summing up his Honour directed the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you are not satisfied as to his (M) reliability as to which mobile phone he was using at the time of the three incidents alleged you must find him (the appellant) not guilty. I remind you in this regard that the Crown has not produced any records in relation to the use of the bright orange Alcatel mobile phone, nor as to the time he (M) had it in his possession.” 
        
       
      
    28 The references to authorities concerning when time may become of the essence in an indictment rather tend to deflect attention from the real issue in this case. His Honour’s direction to the jury earlier set out clearly made time of the essence and the essential question was whether it was unreasonable for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence that the offences took place in the span of time specified in the indictment. 
     
      
    29 I do not consider it was unreasonable of the jury to accept the evidence of M that the relevant contact with the appellant was made by use of the Nokia phone. There were a total of 778 text messages exchanged between that mobile phone and that operated by the appellant. Nor was it unreasonable to conclude that M was mistaken about the time of the events but accurate about the appellant’s actions. Inter alia, his Honour directed the jury “if you find that (M) is not reliable as to when he had that Nokia 3210 mobile phone and you find that he was (not) in fact using it in the time frame of the alleged sexual abuse, then the proper verdict would be one of not guilty.” I have added the word “not” which does not appear in the transcript but the context makes it obvious that his Honour’s direction was in terms favourable to the case presented on behalf of the appellant. No complaint was made that there had been any relevant mis-statement and the absence of the negative word is a likely transcription error.  
     
      
    30 Particularly in dealing with delay in complaint, his Honour on more than one occasion directed that it would be dangerous to convict on M’s evidence alone unless the jury were convinced of its truth and accuracy. Clearly in the way the trial was conducted, the jury would have understood that the Crown was not relying upon accuracy as to M’s evidence concerning the frame of time and his Honour was referring to the descriptions of the offences by M. 
     
      
    31 No complaint has been made of the adequacy of his Honour’s directions which included caution on how the jury could approach the Crown allegations that the appellant had told lies. In addition to the answers to police which have been above recited, the Crown relied upon the untruthfulness of a statement signed by the appellant timed and dated 18:15 on 1 December 2004 on the letterhead of the Blue Mountains City Church which read: 
     
      
       
        
        “I categorically deny ever having abused (M) and deny having any relationship with (M) other than cordially in the course of normal Church functions, meetings and worship services. 
        
       
       
        
        I have never counselled (M) either privately or at the Church premises and he has never approached me directly or asked me to do so at any time.” 
        
       
      
    32 As set out in paragraph iii of the filed grounds of appeal, there were a number of witnesses called testifying to the appellant’s good character. He had no prior convictions. No written or oral submission was addressed to this aspect. His Honour gave the jury appropriate directions on the use they might make of such evidence in favour of the appellant, both as to the improbability of offending and the credibility of his evidence denying the offences. 
     
      
    33 As is requisite when a ground such as the present is advanced, it is necessary in this Court to make an assessment of the evidence which was available to the jury. I am unpersuaded that the jury ought to have concluded that the offences occurred outside the span of time in the indictment. Once it was found that M’s evidence that at all relevant times he was using the Nokia phone it would be entirely reasonable to find in accordance with the dates specified in the indictment. There is fortification for such a finding in the multitude of texts exchanged between the Nokia and the appellant’s phone, many of which were made, the representatives of the telephone service providers were able to testify, late at night. The reasonableness of the jury’s conclusion is further confirmed, if they chose and as was open to them in accordance with the appropriate directions given, to give account to the untruths relied upon by the Crown as manifesting a consciousness of guilt in the appellant.  
     
      
    34 I would dismiss the appeal.

     Danielle SIMPSON v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 17 October 2006 a District Court jury returned a verdict of guilty to an indictment that the applicant did “rob [the victim] of a digital camera, the property of [the victim], while being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife” contrary to the Crimes Act 1900, s 97(1). The maximum penalty for such an offence is 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 On 8 December 2006 the applicant was sentenced for that offence to a non parole period of four years imprisonment, to commence on 18 March 2006 and to expire on 17 March 2010 with a balance of term of two years imprisonment to commence on 18 March 2010 and expire on 17 March 2012. 
     
      
    3 The applicant has sought leave to appeal against that sentence. 
     
      
    4 The facts of the offence are that on 18 March 2006, the victim, a slightly built 20 year old woman, was walking in Bridge Road, Belmore toward Burwood Road where she was intending to catch a bus. She was carrying her digital camera in her right hand and a bag over her left shoulder. As she walked along she saw the applicant, who was physically much bigger than her, standing in front of her, saying “Give me your bag”. The applicant grabbed the victim by the collar and took hold of her bag but the victim resisted and struggled to keep hold of her property. 
     
      
       
      She then saw that the applicant was holding a knife and called out for help as the struggle continued. She fell to the ground and dropped the camera and as she attempted to retrieve it, the applicant seized it, at the same time persisting with her efforts to take the bag. 
       
       
      People began to gather and the applicant attempted to flee, but was held by bystanders. She dropped the knife. The knife had an overall length of 15-16 cm with a black handle of 5-6 cm. In the attack the victim suffered scratches to her hand and some scuffing to her jeans. 
       
      
    5 The applicant is an only child and was born in 1978. She had a happy childhood until the age of 11. Thereafter she had difficulty adjusting to high school and fell into conflict with her parents. She became pregnant at 17 and left her parents’ home after the birth. 
     
      
    6 She then commenced a de facto relationship with her present partner. The relationship has continued for about 10 years. The partner has a drinking problem and suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. 
     
      
    7 The applicant has three surviving children. They have lived in foster care since December 2000 when they were removed from the applicant and her partner as a result of their continued drug use and episodes of domestic violence. Another child died on 2 August 2005 from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome when aged six weeks. 
     
      
    8 The applicant commenced smoking cannabis at age 12. She was using amphetamines and cocaine recreationally at age 19 and at approximately age 20 she was introduced to heroin, to which she soon became addicted. 
     
      
    9 The applicant has had limited education and has had some vocational training and a limited work history. 
     
      
    10 The applicant’s criminal record was described by his Honour in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender has a history of court appearances beginning in August 1996 at the Bidura Children’s Court when she was placed on probation for an offence of steal from dwelling. She was then 17 years of age. In April 1998, she was fined for offences of dishonesty in the Local Court, Balmain. On 21 November 2000 in the Fairfield Local Court she was fined for entering enclosed lands. On 13 June 2001 she was convicted in her absence upon a charge of goods in custody and on 14 November 2001 in the Central Local Court she was fined for goods in custody. Significantly, on 19 October 2001 she was sentenced to imprisonment for four years, including a non parole period of two years to commence on 19 October 2001 in respect of an offence of robbery in company.” (An appeal from that decision resulted in the variation of the commencement date of the sentence to 17 September 2001.) 
        
       
      
    11 The applicant was in custody, bail refused, in respect of the subject offence from 18 March 2006. During that period she recommenced Buprenorphine treatment. She engaged in a number of vocational programmes in the hope of increasing her prospects for employment. She also had a job in the kitchen for some months prior to the imposition of the sentence. 
     
      
    12 The applicant has advanced three grounds of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in finding as an aggravating factor that the offence involved planning 
       
      
    13 In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge found the offence had 
     
      
       
        
        “…involved some limited degree of planning, for although her victim was random, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was at the place where the offence was committed awaiting for an appropriate victim to rob for money or property for the acquisition of drugs. The diminutive stature of [the victim] qualified her as an appropriate target for this purpose.” 
        
       
      
    14 His Honour later in his remarks on sentence said in relation to aggravating factors under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: 
     
      
       
        
        “Next paragraph (n): the offence must have involved some degree of planning and organisation, in light of the offender having with her the knife with which she was armed. Although the selection of her target was random, it must be the case that the offender had planned to take an opportunity to commit such an offence if an appropriate victim came along.” 
        
       
      
    15 The aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(n) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity.” 
        
       
      
    16 Counsel for the applicant submitted that his Honour, by referring to planning and organisation under s 21A(2)(n), had given this aspect of the matter a greater prominence than was appropriate. He also relied upon a comment of Howie J in R v Fahs [2007] NSWCCA 26, where his Honour said in respect of that provision: 
     
      
       
        
        “The wording of this provision seems to me to convey more than simply the offence was planned.” 
        
       
      
    17 In our opinion, the evidence establishes there was planning of a limited degree for the reasons which his Honour stated. It was that degree of planning which his Honour took into account. His Honour was entitled to have regard to that factor in sentencing the applicant whether it be pursuant to s 21A(2)(n) or s 21A(1)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Indeed, counsel for the applicant at the sentencing hearing asked his Honour “to accept there would have been a limited degree of planning”. 
     
      
    18 We reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in his treatment or approach to the applicant’s prospects for rehabilitation, having regard to her criminal history 
       
       
      Ground 3: The sentence is manifestly excessive 
       
      
    19 As previously observed, the applicant had been sentenced in 2001 to four years imprisonment for robbery in company with a two year non parole period. Whilst serving this sentence she had been treated with Buprenorphine, an alternative to heroin, with positive results. The applicant was released to parole in respect of that sentence on 16 September 2003. She continued to use Buprenorphine for a time following her release. There was no record of any offence by the applicant subsequent to her release to parole other than the offence the subject of this application. 
     
      
    20 The applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing that following her release from prison she was obtaining Buprenorphine from a private clinic and paying for it. She was not coping financially and the doctor gave her time to go to a public hospital to obtain the Buprenorphine without charge. However, “something got confused with the scripts. Like, my time had run out at the hospital, but I wasn’t aware of that, so I had to go back to the private clinic and I didn’t have the money at the time, so I was cut off.” She said that she had trouble getting the Buprenorphine from the end of January and all of February. She started using heroin at the end of February, early March. She said that if she had been able to access the Buprenorphine she would not have used heroin. 
     
      
    21 This evidence was consistent with comments in the ERISP conducted on 18 March 2006 where the applicant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “’Cause that’s what it’s all about, they cut my, I’ve been tryin’ for two weeks to get back on the medication…they won’t let me back on it until Tuesday”  
        
       
       
      and 
       
       
        
        “Q49 Sorry, where are you living at the moment? 
         
        A In Belmore… 
        
       
       
        
        Q59 Okay. And how long have you lived there? 
         
        A. Um, not that long, I’ve only been there a couple of weeks, the address in Punchbowl was my address and our lease ran out so we, we left, we didn’t wanna renew the lease cause that’s where our son died, so” 
        
       
      
    22 This evidence however contrasted with the pre sentence report and a psychologist’s report dated 28 November 2006 which were before his Honour. His Honour, in his remarks on sentence, quoted from the pre sentence report as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a)  
      “It appears that the death of their child [from SIDS on 2 August 2005] was the prelude of a marked decline in Ms Simpson’s and her partner’s circumstances, they moved out of their accommodation as they found it too emotionally distressing to remain there, as this was the premises where their baby died. Subsequent instability ensued and Ms Simpson returned to using drugs (heroin)…” 
       
       
      (b)  
      “It appears that Ms Simpson had a great deal of difficulty accessing a subsidised clinic for her Buprenorphine when in the community and it appears she stopped taking her dose and subsequently relapsed, resulting in the offending behaviour. Ms Simpson reported that she was using heroin approximately three times per day prior to her arrest.” 
       
      
    23 His Honour also quoted in his remarks on sentence from the psychologist’s report (which the applicant said she had been through and agreed with): 
     
      
       
      (a)  
      “In the community, Danielle reports that she had difficulty finding a subsidised clinic to obtain Buprenorphine, and she ceased taking her dose. She returned to heroin usage after the death of her baby from SIDS.” 
       
       
      (b)  
      “Then, while on parole, she lost her little boy through SIDS. Danielle and her husband moved out of their house where her boy had died ‘because it was too distressing’ and she felt too much grief to remain there. The couple stayed with people they knew only superficially [who were heroin users] and Danielle returned to drug usage…” 
       
       
      (c)  
      “She was unable to deal with her young baby’s death without returning to heroin usage. In her grief and distress, her life destabilised when she and her partner moved out of their home. Danielle wanted to obtain money for heroin.” 
       
      
    24 His Honour, after considering the pre sentence and psychologist’s reports said in his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The history of heroin use and the return to the use of heroin as a consequence of the loss of her son stands in contrast to what was said to me in evidence by [the applicant]…Her sworn evidence is that she was coping with the undoubtedly severe grief that she was suffering as a consequence of the loss of her son, and had continued on the maintenance programme up to and beyond the time of the little boy’s death, and that it was the inability to obtain the Buprenorphine for a period of one to two weeks which led her to resort once again to heroin.” 
        
       
      
    25 His Honour did not expressly resolve this seeming conflict in the evidence. However, he implicitly accepted the applicant’s sworn evidence as he concluded: 
     
      
       
      (a)  
      “This view [as to the applicant being less than robust at the time of the offence because of the ravages of drugs] is qualified to some extent by the evidence that has been given by the offender before me today, in which she said that up until about a week before the offence, she had been taking her alternative medication for the management of her addiction to heroin. It must follow from that, that she was not, at the time of the offence, experiencing long term effects from the addiction to heroin manifesting in her physical appearance.” 
       
       
      (b)  
      “One must have sympathy for the losses that the offender has suffered in her life and I note that according to the reports, the offender has suggested those events as some explanation for her continued use of drugs. However, as I have noted, such representations are inconsistent with what the offender has had to say to me here. In any event, I am of the view that those tragedies, as grave as they are, do not offer any justification in the circumstances of this offence for the offender’s behaviour on this occasion.” 
       
       
      (c)  
      “As has been pointed out, accepting that what she said in the witness box is the truth of the matter, her lack of funds at the point in time when she found herself unable to acquire the alternative legitimate substance is something of her own doing.” 
       
       
      (d)  
      “However, it is troubling that she allowed herself to mismanage funds sufficiently to consequently lose access to the alternative and legitimate substance, by means of which she could manage her addiction to heroin and that she thereafter embarked upon the use of heroin three times per day, and so readily committed an armed robbery with which to acquire funds to obtain further heroin.” 
        
       
      
    26 Thus, on the preferable reading of the sentencing judge’s reasons, his Honour accepted the applicant’s evidence to the effect that she had started using heroin only shortly before the offence when she could not get the Buprenorphine.  
     
      
    27 His Honour nonetheless considered that her prior offending was relevant to sentencing in the manner described in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 677-8, taking it into account as an aggravating factor identified in s 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It is, with respect, not entirely clear how it affected the sentence he imposed. 
     
      
    28 The judge said that the relevance of prior convictions as described in Veen v The Queen (No 2) was - 
     
      
       
        
        “…apposite to this offender, who, by the history of offending, reflected in her antecedents and the conduct in which she has engaged on this occasion, has demonstrated that some care is required when assessing her prospects of rehabilitation from such misconduct. When reviewing this history, I have kept in mind the following passages. 
        
       
       
        
        The earlier conviction for robbery, with the benefit of an extended period of parole which, according to the pre-sentence report, concluded successfully, demonstrates that this offence is not an uncharacteristic aberration, but is a further occasion of the offender’s propensity for violent theft to acquire funds when in need of them for the acquisition of drugs. This pattern continues notwithstanding the opportunity for rehabilitation given to the offender in the previous sentence. I do not overlook the grief from the loss of her child toward the end of the parole period and I accept that there may be some aspect of this offering an explanation for her conduct. It certainly explained why she moved from the house in which she and her partner lived and why they moved to where they ultimately settled with others who were users of heroin. One can also understand that heroin might have provided some comfort for the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        However, she has also had the benefit of treatment and access to an alternative drug. In the circumstances, her decision to resort to the use of heroin does not provide much in the way of mitigation. As has been pointed out, accepting what she said in the witness box is the truth of the matter, her lack of funds at the point in time when she found herself unable to acquire the alternative legitimate substance is something of her own doing.” 
        
       
      
    29 The judge later said - 
     
      
       
        
        “There is an indication that the offender had reached a point at which she might have finally abandoned her use of illicit drugs and developed an existence in which she would evolve emotionally and economically without the need for drugs and the commission of crime from which to fund it, thereby providing some justification for an appropriate reduction of the overall sentence, indicated otherwise by the objective seriousness of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        However, it is troubling that she allowed herself to mismanage funds sufficiently to consequently lose access to the alternative and legitimate substance, by means of which she could manage her addiction to heroin, and that she thereafter embarked upon the use of heroin three times per day, and so readily committed an armed robbery with which to acquire funds to obtain further heroin. 
        
       
       
        
        It has been submitted strenuously on her behalf that this is something of an aberration within the context of the period of time since her release from her last sentence and the successful completion of her parole. My initial response to that was that yes, that it was - this may well be an aberration within that context. 
        
       
       
        
        However, I must look beyond that and look at the offender’s conduct and antecedents to assess whether in fact it is aberrant behaviour or conduct into which the offender will readily and easily fall, requiring the application of the principles stated from  
        R v Veen (No. 2) 
         to which I have referred. Even if it be the case that this is something of an aberration that the offender has suffered no more than a relapse along the road to rehabilitation that commenced with her release on parole following her last robbery offence, in my assessment, It would be counter-productive to that continued rehabilitation to permit her release to the community at this stage or within the immediate or foreseeable future. I do not believe there has been any sufficient demonstration by the offender that she has reached the point where she can be safely released into the community without the risk of further offending. 
        
       
       
        
        I am of the view that the discipline of a custodial sentence is essential to this offender at this stage of her life. She has demonstrated that when left to her own devices, she has not had the capacity to maintain a lifestyle that will facilitate her abstinence from drugs or the commission of crimes to support their use.” 
        
       
      
    30 These passages have some difficulties. The offence is bluntly found to be “not an uncharacteristic aberration”, then an initial response to the contrary is expressed, and ultimately whether “application of the principles stated from R v Veen (No 2)” is required is rather left up in the air. On the assumption that the offence was an aberration, the applicant’s rehabilitation was seen to be promoted by “the discipline of a custodial sentence” because she “has not had the capacity to maintain a lifestyle that will facilitate her abstinence from drugs or the commission of crimes to support their use”. This seems to refer to the earlier statements that the inability to pay for the Buprenorphine was “something of her own doing” and that the applicant “allowed herself to mismanage funds sufficiently to consequently lose access to the alternative and legitimate substance”. The sentencing in the end appears to have involved some kind of “application of the principles stated from R v Veen (No 2)”, on the basis that the re-offending through incapacity to maintain a drug and crime free lifestyle warranted greater severity of sentence. 
     
      
    31 It is not necessary to explore the validity of this beyond saying that in our view it proceeded on a flawed apprehension of the evidence. 
     
      
    32 The applicant’s evidence was that she was paying a private clinic for her Buprenorphine. She was not coping financially upon the death of her child and with the need to pay for the funeral, and the doctor gave her scripts to obtain it from a public hospital without payment. She was unexpectedly required to pay for the Buprenorphine when “something got confused with the scripts”. When the judge said to the effect that the applicant had demonstrated that when left to her own devices she had not had the capacity to maintain a drug and crime free lifestyle, the incapacity material to the offending was not truly one of lifestyle. The applicant must have had to pay for heroin, hence the offence in order to get money, but there was no evidence of comparative costs or exploration of mismanagement of funds resulting in resort to heroin rather than Buprenorphine. To say that the applicant mismanaged her funds and that the inability to pay for the Buprenorphine was something of her own doing does not seem to us correctly to state the position. 
     
      
    33 The difficulties with the judge’s remarks on sentence do not mean that the sentence was erroneous. It is necessary that this Court consider that some other less severe sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. 
     
      
    34 In our opinion, and with regard to the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, the sentence was excessive. There was reason to give rehabilitation prominence in the sentencing considerations, in that the applicant had completed her parole and had not offended for a further six months, and until the confusion with the scripts had legitimately used Buprenorphine without resort to heroin. That had to be tempered by the re-offending, but the re-offending was in circumstances which left rehabilitation of importance. The applicant was not a young offender with little or no criminal history, and she did not plead guilty (although the contest was over possession of a knife rather than the robbery itself). These features tending to a more severe sentence were balanced against the importance of rehabilitation, and on a balance of features in our opinion a sentence in the four to five year range indicated in R v Henry was appropriate.  
     
      
    35 With a view to any re-sentencing, there was read on the applicant’s behalf an affidavit from her and one from her solicitor annexing copies of reports made by gaol authorities as to the applicant. The latter contains a number of complimentary references to the applicant’s working in prison. There are two incidents where she has been found in possession of medication not prescribed for her but, given the absence of any evidence that she has been disciplined for these events, we do not regard them as of more than moderate weight. We have also taken into account as s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires be done, such of the matters referred to in that section as are known to the Court. However, given the issues as they were presented during the appeal, we do not regard it as necessary to refer to these seriatim. 
     
      
    36 The special circumstances found by the judge should be maintained. The orders of the Court are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2 Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      3. Sentence quashed and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a non parole period of three years commencing on 18 March 2006 and expiring on 17 March 2009 with a balance of term of one year six months to commence on 18 March 2009 and expire on 17 September 2010. The applicant will be eligible for release to parole on 17 March 2009.

     Commonwealth of Australia v John Henry Griffiths & Anor 
     
     
      
     
     
     Headnote 
     
     
     The New South Wales State police seized a quantity of substances from industrial premises operated by the first respondent, Mr Griffiths. Thereafter, Mr Griffiths was arrested and charged under s 24 of the  
     Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
     1985 with being knowingly concerned in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, methcathinone. The seized substances were provided to the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL), which is conducted by the appellant, the Commonwealth, for analysis. A Mr Ballard, who was employed by AGAL and an authorised analyst under s 37A of the  
     Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 
     , undertook a number of analyses of the seized substance and subsequently provided a certificate of analysis stating the substance was methcathinone. 
      
     Mr Griffiths stood trial and was found guilty. He appealed to the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal. The appeal was upheld and a verdict of acquittal was entered. The basis for the acquittal was that Mr Ballard had manipulated the testing of the substance so as to produce an analysis that the substance was methcathinone. 
      
     Mr Griffiths commenced proceedings against, relevantly, the Commonwealth and Mr Ballard, alleging that each had breached a duty of care owed to him, by the issue of the certificate of analysis. Mr Griffiths also brought a claim under the  
     Trade Practices Act  
     (Cth) 1974 alleging the Commonwealth and Mr Ballard had contravened s 52 of the Act. Proceedings were brought before Master Harrison (as her Honour then was) for summary dismissal or strike out. Her Honour dismissed the statement of claim finding there was no reasonable cause of action as the defendants were protected by witness immunity. Mr Griffiths appealed from her Honour’s decision. On appeal, Justice Rothman dismissed the proceedings against Mr Ballard but left in place the proceedings brought against the Commonwealth finding there was an arguable case, both, that witness immunity did not apply to the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth contravened s 52 of the  
     Trade Practices Act 
     . 
      
     The Commonwealth appealed against the decision of Rothman J. Mr Griffiths filed a cross-appeal alleging his Honour erred in dismissing the proceedings against Mr Ballard.  
      
     Held per BEAZLEY JA (MASON P and YOUNG CJ in Eq agreeing): 
      
      Summary disposal of proceedings 
       
      (1) If it is demonstrated that there is a real question to be tried, the matter is inappropriate for the entry of summary judgment: [11]-[12]

      Is Mr Ballard protected by witness immunity? 
       
       
      (2) Witness immunity protects persons from being sued as a result of evidence the person gives in proceedings and in respect of out of court conduct, provided that that conduct is sufficiently connected with the proceedings: [42], [84]

      (3) Witness immunity is founded ultimately in consideration of the finality of judgments: [43]-[49]

      (4) Mr Ballard gave evidence about all of the tests he conducted and there was no suggestion that the certificate of analysis was prepared other than as part of the steps preparatory to trial. There was no possible basis to suggest his earlier or later testing was carried out for any other purpose unassociated with the prosecution of Mr Griffiths: [92] 
       
       
      (5) A trial based upon the negligent performance of Mr Ballard would involve the retrial, not only of the evidence given at trial but also of the preparatory steps taken in the issue of the certificate of analysis. This would be inconsistent with the underlying basis of witness immunity: [93]-[94]

      Is AGAL protected from vicarious liability by Mr Ballard’s immunity? 
       
      (6) A person who is vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of another is protected by any immunity that is available to the actual wrongdoer. Therefore, AGAL is protected from suit in respect of its vicarious liability for Mr Ballard’s conduct: [115]-[116]

      Is AGAL protected from suit for its direct liability? 
       
      (7) To allow the matter to proceed against AGAL on the basis that it failed to have in place proper procedures and protocols to ensure testing was carried out correctly would require the adducing of evidence in court to support the allegation against AGAL. This would offend the underlying rationale of witness immunity: [120]

      (8)  
      Witness immunity is absolute unless 
        
      a matter falls within one of the recognised exceptions or there is a clear statutory provision that excludes the immunity. There is nothing in the  
      Trade Practices Act 
       that provides a basis for excluding the immunity such that AGAL and Mr Ballard are immune from the provisions of the Act: [121]

      Mr Ballard and AGAL’s alleged duty of care 
       
      (9) AGAL, by the employment of analysts who are appointed by the Minister under the  
      Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 
      , 
        
      plays an integral role in law enforcement. To impose a duty of care would place conflicting claims or obligations on the carrying out of their functions and would potentially give rise to indeterminate liability. The same considerations apply to Mr Ballard such that he also did not owe a duty of care to Mr Griffiths: [127]-[131]

      Whether certificate of analysis issued in trade or commerce 
       
      (10) It would be unusual for the content of a statutory certificate to have the incidents of a commercial activity. In addition, where the conduct relied upon is related to the giving of evidence as a witness, such conduct does not have the necessary connection to fall within the concept of trade or commerce: [141]-[142]

     Commonwealth of Australia v John Henry Griffiths & Anor 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MASON P: I agree with Beazley JA. 
     
      
    2 BEAZLEY JA: This appeal arises out of a motion brought pursuant to Pt 13 r 5 and Pt 15 r 26 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 to dismiss or strike out, respectively, the first respondent’s (Mr Griffiths) statement of claim. Mr Griffiths has claimed damages against Peter Ballard, the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of New South Wales, for injury and loss he alleges he sustained arising out of a false or misleading statement in a certificate of analysis prepared and signed by Mr Ballard, an analyst appointed pursuant to s 37A of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act).  
     
      
    3 The certificate of analysis identified a substance which had been seized by police on or about 2 or 3 July 1999 from premises operated by Mr Griffiths as a laboratory, as the prohibited substance methcathinone notwithstanding that the tests conducted by Mr Ballard gave inconclusive results for methcathinone. Mr Griffiths was prosecuted and found guilty of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. However, the conviction was overturned on appeal and an acquittal entered by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal: R v Piggott, Griffiths & Simeon [2002] NSWCCA 218.  
     
      
    4 The essential issue which arises on the appeal is whether the Commonwealth and Mr Ballard are amenable to suit, or whether they are protected by the operation of the principles of witness immunity. 
     
      
       
      The background to the appeal 
       
      
    5 The appeal with which this Court is concerned is an appeal from orders made by Rothman J on 10 April 2006: Griffiths v Ballard [2006] NSWSC 245. His Honour’s reasons are contained in his judgment dated 22 December 2005: Griffiths v Ballard [2005] NSWSC 1350. The proceedings before his Honour involved an appeal from the decision of Master Harrison (as her Honour then was) of 25 August 2004, in which her Honour made orders dismissing the proceedings brought by Mr Griffiths against Mr Ballard and the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL), which was conducted by the Commonwealth: Griffiths v Ballard & 2 Ors [2004] NSWSC 763. 
     
      
    6 The effect of Rothman J’s orders was to dismiss the proceedings against Mr Ballard, but to leave in place the proceedings brought against AGAL. The appeal, (in respect of which leave to appeal has been granted) is against his Honour’s refusal, in effect, to strike out the statement of claim as against AGAL.  
     
      
    7 Mr Griffiths has brought a cross-appeal challenging the dismissal of the proceedings against Mr Ballard.  
     
      
    8 The State of New South Wales has filed a submitting appearance, save as to costs. 
     
      
    9 As the proceedings came before the court for summary dismissal or strike out, the relevant facts for consideration are those pleaded in the statement of claim, together with the additional facts indisputably established by the evidence adduced by the parties. The parties have agreed that the relevant pleading is a proposed second further amended statement of claim (the amended pleading), which was the pleading upon which the trial judge considered the motion.  
     
      
    10 Part 13 r 5 of the Supreme Court Rules (as then in force) provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Where in any proceedings it appears to the Court that in relation to the proceedings generally or in relation to any claim for relief in the proceedings: 
         
         
        (a) no reasonable cause of action is disclosed, 
         
         
        (b) the proceedings are frivolous or vexatious, or

      Part 15 r 26 provided:

    11 The general principles relating to the summary disposal of proceedings are well-known: see General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) & Ors [1964] HCA 69; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 129. If it is demonstrated that there is a real question to be tried, the matter is inappropriate for the entry of summary judgment: Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners [1949] HCA 1; (1949) 78 CLR 62. The tests stated in the authorities as to whether it is appropriate that a case be disposed of by the entry of summary judgment include statements such as that the matter is “so obviously untenable that it cannot possibly succeed”; “manifestly groundless” or “would involve useless expense”: see General Steel Industries at 129. 
     
      
    12 The summary disposal of proceedings or part thereof deprives a party of the right to a contested hearing. For that reason it is said that the requirement for establishing that there is no triable issue is demanding: Air Services Australia v Zarb (Court of Appeal, 26 August 1998, unreported). In Webster & Anor v Lampard [1993] HCA 57; (1993) 177 CLR 598, Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said at 602: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the issue before the learned Master on the application for summary judgment was not whether [the plaintiffs] would probably succeed in their action against [the defendant]. It was whether the material before the Master demonstrated that that action should not be permitted to go to trial in the ordinary way because it was apparent that it must fail. The power to order summary judgment must be exercised with ‘exceptional caution’ and ‘should never be exercised unless it is clear that there is no real question to be tried.” (Citations omitted) 
        
       
       
      Background facts 
       
      
    13 The appellant, the Commonwealth of Australia, conducts the analytical laboratories, AGAL, and within the auspices of AGAL conducts a unit known as the Australian Forensic Drug Laboratory. I will refer to the appellant as AGAL. 
     
      
    14 Mr Griffiths is a qualified pharmacist whose work relevantly involved the development of pharmaceuticals for potential sale, both within Australia and overseas. On about 2 or 3 July 1999, the New South Wales State police seized a quantity of substances from industrial premises at Castle Hill that were operated by Mr Griffiths. Thereafter, on 7 July 1999, Mr Griffiths was arrested and charged under s 24 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act) with being knowingly concerned in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely, methcathinone.  
     
      
    15 The seized substances were provided to the Australian Forensic Drug Laboratory of AGAL for analysis. Mr Ballard was the analyst assigned to undertake the analysis of the seized substances. He is an authorised analyst under s 37A of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act. He is also authorised to provide certificates of analysis under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. He was employed as an analyst by AGAL and thus was an employee of the Commonwealth.  
     
      
    16 Mr Ballard undertook the analysis of the seized substance at some time between 6 July and 5 August 1999 and on 7 September 1999 issued a certificate of analysis pursuant to s 43 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (the certificate of analysis) that stated that the seized substance was methcathinone. The certificate of analysis was used by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) in the prosecution of Mr Griffiths.  
     
      
    17 Mr Griffiths stood trial and was found guilty by a jury on 15 June 2001 and remained in custody until 26 October 2001. Mr Griffiths appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The appeal was upheld and a verdict of acquittal was entered. Putting the matter in general terms, which is sufficient for present purposes, the basis for the acquittal was that Mr Ballard had manipulated the testing of the substance so as to produce an analysis that the substance was methcathinone. It is not contended in these proceedings that he did so intentionally or fraudulently. 
     
      
    18 Mr Griffiths commenced proceedings against, relevantly, the Commonwealth and Mr Ballard, alleging that each had breached a duty of care that each owed to him, by the issue of the certificate of analysis which was false or wrong and that he had suffered loss and damage as a result. Mr Griffiths also brought a claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the Trade Practices Act) and a claim for conversion of the seized substance and for misfeasance in public office. The claims for conversion and for misfeasance in public office have been withdrawn. 
     
      
    19 In pleading the existence of a duty of care, Mr Griffiths alleged that AGAL knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the information, and relevantly, the certificate of analysis, that AGAL provided to the police or the DPP would be relied upon by the DPP in determining whether or not to prosecute or to continue to prosecute the criminal proceedings against him. It was also alleged that AGAL knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the DPP relied on AGAL to exercise all reasonable care in the conduct of its analyses so as to correctly identify the seized substance and to fully and accurately advise the police or the DPP of the method and results of those analyses. 
     
      
    20 A similar allegation of the existence of a duty of care was made against Mr Ballard. 
     
      
    21 In the particulars to the statement of claim, it was alleged that AGAL had a duty to exercise reasonable supervision and control over its employees in order to ensure the accuracy of any analysis undertaken and of any certificate of analysis that was issued based upon such analysis. It was also alleged that there was a duty to provide an effective system of checking that its protocols or standard operational procedures were consistently applied in the conduct of analyses and an effective system of checking the accuracy of the results of any analysis that was undertaken. 
     
      
    22 Contrary to the statement in the certificate of analysis, the seized substance was not methcathinone. It followed that the certificate was false, either because the substance was not methcathinone, or because it had not been qualified in any way so as to indicate that there was an anomaly in the test results. Mr Ballard did not disclose the falsity of the statement or the anomalous results to the DPP.  
     
      
    23 Mr Griffiths further alleged that AGAL and Mr Ballard, by the issue of the certificate of analysis and by the failure to disclose the discrepancy in the testing procedures, made a misleading representation to the police and the DPP. 
     
      
    24 The pleading as to causation is to be found in paras 38 and 39 of the amended pleading. In brief terms, it was alleged that but for the breach of duty, Mr Ballard and AGAL would have analysed the substances as not being methcathinone and reported that to the police and the DPP, or alternatively, would have reported that it was not possible to identify the substances as methcathinone. It was alleged that the failure to do so had caused loss and damage. 
     
      
    25 The pleading under the Trade Practices Act was based upon the issue of the false certificate of analysis and the representations as alleged in paras 24, 25, 27, 28, and 35 of the amended pleading, to which reference has been made above. It was alleged that that conduct was engaged in during the course of trade or commerce within the meaning of the Trade Practices Act and was in contravention of s 52 of that Act. 
     
      
       
      Issues on the appeal 
       
      
    26 Three issues are raised on the appeal and the cross-appeal and they may conveniently be dealt with together. The first issue is whether AGAL and Mr Ballard are immune from suit on the basis of the application of the principles of witness immunity. If either is immune from suit, then that is a complete answer to Mr Griffiths’ proceedings against that party. The second issue is whether either AGAL or Mr Ballard owed a duty of care to Mr Griffiths. The third issue is whether AGAL and Mr Ballard are liable to Mr Griffiths for damages as a consequence of a contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act. (The pleading against Mr Ballard was that he was knowingly concerned in the contravention.) 
     
      
       
      Statutory context 
       
      
    27 Both the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act and the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act are relevant to the issues presently under consideration.  
     
      
    28 The Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act is  
     
      
       
        
        “An Act relating to the regulation, control and prohibition of the supply and use of poisons, restricted substances, drugs of addiction, certain dangerous drugs and certain therapeutic goods …” 
        
       
      
    29 As is stated above, Mr Ballard was appointed as an analyst under s 37A, which is contained within Pt 5 Div 2 of the Act. Part 5 is headed “Offences”. Division 2 of Pt 5 is headed “Analysts and analysis”. Section 37A provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Appointment of analysts 
         
         
        (1) The Minister may appoint particular persons or a class of persons to be analysts for the purposes of this Act. 
         
         
        (2) The appointment of a particular person as an analyst is to be by a document of appointment given to the person. 
         
         
        (3) The appointment of a class of persons to be analysts is to be by means of a notice published in the Gazette. 
         
         
        (4) Persons may be appointed as analysts whether or not they are employed under Part 2 of the  
        Public Sector Management Act 1988 
        .” 
        
       
      
    30 Section 37B provides for the conduct of analyses. Relevantly, it provides 
     
      
       
        
        “Conduct of analyses 
         
         
        (1) An inspector may submit for analysis under this section any substance or goods seized under this Act. 
         
         
        (2) An analyst is required to carry out or personally supervise the carrying out of an analysis of a substance or goods submitted to the analyst for analysis. 
         
         
        (3) An analyst who has carried out or personally supervised the carrying out of an analysis of any such substance or goods may, and must on request, issue a certificate of analysis setting out the results of the analysis. 
         
         
        (4) The owner of any such substance or goods, or the person in whose possession or under whose control the substance or goods were when they were seized, is entitled to be provided with a copy of the certificate of analysis relating to the substance or goods on payment of the fee (if any) prescribed by the regulations.” 
        
       
      
    31 Division 3 of Pt 5 relates to “Evidentiary matters”.  
     
      
    32 Mr Griffiths was charged with an offence under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act s 24. That section provides, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “Manufacture and production of prohibited drugs 
         
         
        (1) A person who manufactures or produces, or who knowingly takes part in the manufacture or production of, a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.” 
        
       
      
    33 The certificate of analysis was provided under s 43 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. That section provides, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “43 Certificate evidence 
         
         
        (1) Any analyst analysing any plant or substance submitted to the analyst or under whose supervision the analysis of any plant or substance submitted to the analyst is carried out may give a certificate of the result of the analysis. 
         
         
        (2) In any legal proceedings under this Act, the production of a certificate, purporting to be signed by an analyst, shall be prima facie evidence of the identity of the plant or substance analysed, the quantity or mass of the plant or substance analysed and of the result of the analysis, without proof of the signature, employment or appointment of the person appearing to have signed the certificate.” 
        
       
       
      Further relevant facts 
       
      
    34 I have set out the essential factual basis upon which Mr Griffiths based his claim. Senior counsel for Mr Griffiths contends that the factual matrix is more complex and when the full background is taken into account, this is not a case where it could be said that the there was no reasonable cause of action disclosed on the pleadings. The additional facts principally relate to the steps that were taken prior to the issuing of the certificate of analysis. It was submitted that these steps undertaken by Mr Ballard must be viewed, not only in the context of the time at which they were performed, but also by reference to the purposes for which they were performed.  
     
      
    35 Senior counsel contended that a construction of these preliminary steps reveal, at least at a prima facie level, that, save for one analysis, none of the other analyses were undertaken for the purposes of providing a certificate of analysis under s 43 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. It was further submitted that even the one analysis that did lead to the production of the certificate of analysis was not so “intimately connected” with the giving of evidence in court as to be protected by witness immunity. 
     
      
    36 It is necessary, therefore, to consider the additional material to see whether, on the facts alleged in the pleading and on the additional facts that were before the Court on the notice of motion, AGAL and Mr Ballard had established that there was no reasonable cause of action disclosed on the pleadings.  
     
      
    37 The written submissions filed on behalf of Mr Griffiths contain a detailed summary of the additional facts and the following is drawn from those written submissions. The source of the facts is fully referenced and there was no dispute as to their accuracy. 
     
      
       
      1. The search of Mr Griffiths’ premises occurred on 29 June 1999. The search was undertaken by the New South Wales police, accompanied by Mr Murtagh, a forensic analytical chemist who was also an employee of AGAL. Samples of substances found on the premises were taken by the police for examination. On 1 July 1999, two persons working at the premises were arrested and the police seized seven plastic bags containing a substance that was made the subject of the charge.  
       
       
      2. Three analytical tests were available to identify the nature of the substance that had been seized: the Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry test (GCMS); the Thin Layer Chromatography test (TLC); and the Infra-red Spectrography test (IR). The expert evidence (that had been given in the criminal proceedings) was to the effect that the most reliable test was the GCMS. There were three ways in which that test could be conducted and without dealing with them in detail, they may be identified as ‘the curator’s standard’; ‘the library standard’; and ‘the literature standard’. The expert evidence was that the literature standard was inferior to the curator’s standard. 
       
       
      3. On 6 July 1999, Mr Ballard undertook the IR (‘the first analysis’) and TLC test (‘the second analysis’) of samples from each of the seven plastic bags. He visually compared a spectrum to results published in a journal to which he was directed by Mr Murtagh. That analysis did not conform to National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) standards. Mr Ballard reached a conclusion, subject to further testing, that the samples were methcathinone, however did not regard the results as settling that the substance was methcathinone. 
       
       
      4. Mr Griffiths was arrested on 7 July 1999.  
       
       
      5. On 12 July 1999, Mr Ballard undertook a second analysis of the substances. 
       
       
      6. On 14 July 1999, the police asked Mr Ballard for a certificate of analysis (preliminary). 
       
       
      7. On 15 July 1999, Mr Ballard carried out a GCMS test on one sample and by a visual comparison with the literature standard concluded that the substance was methcathinone (‘the third analysis’). There was a remarkable discrepancy between the ion intensity of the results of the samples and those contained in the literature. The Court of Criminal Appeal took the view that the conclusion ought to have been treated as tentative at best. 
       
       
      8. On 25 August 1999, Mr Ballard conducted the GCMS test using the ‘curator’s sample’ method. AGAL had received the curator’s standard on 5 August 1999. Mr Ballard ran the test, he said, “ 
      to establish that the substance was methcathinone 
      ” (‘the fourth analysis’).  
       
       
      9. On 8 August 1999, Mr Ballard issued a certificate of analysis (preliminary). 
       
       
      10. In calibrating the machine, Mr Ballard keyed in a “ 
      retention time 
      ” of 9.8 minutes with a permissible tolerance margin of 0.2 minutes, called the “ 
      window 
      ”: ie, if a retention time of 9.8 minutes, plus or minus 0.2 minutes, was found, then the substance would be described by the machine as methcathinone.  
       
       
      11. After the results of the test yielded a result which did not match methcathinone, Mr Ballard recalibrated the ‘window’ to make it wider so that a result of methcathinone would be returned. 
       
       
      12. On 7 September 1999, Mr Ballard issued the certificate of analysis. The certificate was issued on AGAL letterhead. Mr Ballard stated that he was an authorised analyst under s 37A of the  
      Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 
       and employed by the AGAL. 
       
       
      13. On 15 September 1999, Mr Ballard carried out further GCMS tests on one sample (‘the fifth analysis’). 
       
       
      14. On 23 May 2000, the committal hearing of Mr Griffiths occurred over four days, the last of which was on 24 August 2000. 
       
       
      15. On 16 August 2000, Mr Ballard conducted a FTIR analysis on one sample only (‘the sixth analysis’). 
       
       
      16. On 18 August 2000, AGAL carried out a further GCMS test on another sample (‘the seventh analysis’). 
       
       
      17. On 18 January 2001, AGAL carried out a further GCMS test on the remaining samples (‘the final analysis’). 
       
       
      18. All of the fifth to seventh analyses yielded results not consistent with methcathinone.  
       
       
      19. On 29 January 2001, Mr Griffiths’ criminal trial commenced. 
       
       
      20. On 10 April 2001, Mr Ballard was called as a witness and gave evidence until 3 May 2001. 
       
       
      21. In his evidence-in-chief, Mr Ballard gave details of the manner in which the tests were conducted. During the course of that evidence it became apparent that Mr Ballard had ‘interacted’ with the machines during the course of their run. The ‘change’ of the window had never previously been mentioned in any document, but came to light during the course of cross-examination. 
       
       
      22. On 15 June 2001, Mr Griffiths was found guilty. 
       
       
      23. On 18 July 2001, Mr Griffiths was convicted and sentenced. 
       
       
      24. On 26 October 2001, his Honour Justice Wood granted Mr Griffiths appeal bail. 
       
       
      25. On 7 June 2002, Mr Griffiths was successful in his appeal and the conviction was quashed. 
       
       
      26. It is alleged in these proceedings that at all material times Mr Ballard and AGAL knew (or would have reasonably expected) that information relating to the substances and their analysis would be passed on to the police and the DPP and relied on by them in determining whether to prosecute, or continue to prosecute Mr Griffiths. 
       
       
      Basis of AGAL’s alleged liability 
       
      
    38 Mr Griffiths alleged that Mr Ballard was employed by AGAL and that in carrying out the tests, he was acting in the course of and within the scope of his authority in providing his services to AGAL. The pleading against AGAL is twofold. First, it alleges that it is vicariously liable for the conduct of Mr Ballard. Secondly, in the particulars of AGAL’s duty of care in para 17, it is pleaded that AGAL had a:  
     
      
       
        
        “… duty to exercise reasonable supervision and control over its employees in order to ensure that the accuracy of analyses and any certificate of analysis and a duty to provide an effective system of checking that AGAL’s protocols or standard operation procedures were consistently applied in the conduct of analyses and an effective system of checking the accuracy of the results of analyses …”  
        
       
       
      Particularised in that way, the pleading alleges that AGAL had an independent duty to have in place a system to ensure that analyses undertaken and certificates issued by its analysts, were accurate. I will refer to this as AGAL’s direct liability. 
       
      
    39 An employer may be vicariously liable for the actions of its employees. The law in that area is well established and does not need to be restated. The question whether a person who is vicariously liable for the conduct of another is protected by an immunity that applies to the conduct of that person, is a different question, and is at the heart of the issue on the appeal.  
     
      
    40 Mr Griffiths contends that the immunity attaches to witnesses and does not extend beyond that to protect other parties who may owe a legal liability arising out of the conduct of the witness, regardless of whether the liability is vicarious or direct. AGAL contends that it is protected in respect of both aspects of liability.  
     
      
       
      Witness immunity 
       
      
    41 The principle of immunity from suit was explained by Lord Mansfield in R v Skinner (1772) Lofft 54 at 56; (1772) 98 ER 529 at 530 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… neither party, witness, counsel, the jury, or Judge can be put to answer, civilly or criminally, for words spoken in office.” 
        
       
      
    42 The existence of the general immunity is not in dispute. The issue in this case is the reach of its application. There is no doubt that the immunity protects a person from being sued as a result of evidence the person gives in proceedings. There is also no doubt that the immunity extends to protect persons from being sued in respect of out of court conduct, provided that that conduct is sufficiently connected with the proceedings. The swearing of an affidavit is an easily identifiable example: see D’Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid & Anor [2005] HCA 12; (2005) 223 CLR 1; Ollis v New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] NSWCA 311. The question here is whether it extends to protect a person in respect of acts that are preparatory to trial. That question, in turn, raises the question as to what matters are properly considered as being preparatory to trial, as opposed to being part of the investigative process, or at least that part of the investigative process which is not protected. 
     
      
    43 The rationale for witness immunity is generally stated as being founded in the promotion of two objectives: first, ensuring that witnesses are able to give evidence freely in an atmosphere avoid of threats of suit from disappointed litigants; and secondly, to avoid multiplicity of actions in which the evidence would be tried over again: see D’Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid at 17-20 [37]-[42]; Meadow v General Medical Council [2007] QB 462 at 476 [14].  
     
      
    44 The immunity operates even if the evidence given by a witness is false: Cabassi v Vila [1940] HCA 41; (1940) 64 CLR 130. In that case, Ms Cabassi had brought proceedings against a Mr Ferrando, alleging assault. The proceedings were defended and Mr Ferrando called a number of witnesses to explain the circumstances in which Ms Cabassi had received the injuries of which she complained. The assault proceedings were dismissed. Subsequently, Ms Cabassi brought an action against Mr Ferrando and two of the witnesses in the assault proceedings, claiming they had conspired together for the purposes of injuring her by the giving of false evidence.  
     
      
    45 In dismissing the appeal, Rich ACJ explained the rationale underlying witness immunity at 139: 
     
      
       
        
        “An action by the defeated party cannot … be maintained against a witness or witnesses for giving false testimony in favour of his opponent. Public policy and the safe administration of justice require that witnesses, who are a necessary part of the judicial machinery, be privileged against any restraint, excepting that imposed by the penalty for perjury. Though not a party to the former suit and judgment, the merits of that judgment cannot be re-examined by a trial of the witness' testimony in a suit against him. The procedure, if permitted, would encourage and multiply vexatious suits, and lead to interminable litigation.” (Citations omitted) 
        
       
       
      Starke J, commenting on this point, said at 140-141: 
       
       
        
        “No action lies in respect of evidence given by witnesses in the course of judicial proceedings, however false and malicious it may be ... the rule of law is that no action lies against witnesses in respect of evidence prepared, given, adduced or procured by them in the course of legal proceedings. The law protects witnesses and others, not for their benefit, but for a higher interest, namely, the advancement of public justice. The remedy against a witness who has given or procured false evidence is by means of the criminal law or by the punitive process of contempt of court.” (Citations omitted ) 
        
       
       
      McTiernan J stated at 144-145: 
       
       
        
        “It is a rule of law that no civil action lies at the suit of any person for any statement made by a witness in the course of giving evidence in a judicial proceeding. The rule, which is founded on public policy, is not confined to actions for defamation but applies to any form of action. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        In spite of all that can be said against it, we find the rule acted upon from the earliest times. The mischief would be immense if the person aggrieved, instead of preferring an indictment for perjury, could turn his complaint into a civil action. By universal assent it appears that in this country no such action lies.” 
        
       
      
    46 There are well recognised exceptions to the immunity, including prosecutions for perjury, contempt of court and for perverting the course of justice: see Cabassi v Vila; and in the case of any clear statutory provision to the contrary: Jamieson and Brugmans v R [1993] HCA 48; (1993) 177 CLR 574 per Deane and Dawson JJ at 582.  
     
      
    47 The High Court recently considered the rationale underlying the immunity in D’Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid. The issue in D’Orta-Ekenaike was the immunity of advocates. However, in considering that question, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ, at 18-19 [39]-[40], stated in respect of witness immunity: 
     
      
       
        
        “From as early as the sixteenth century, a disappointed litigant could not sue those who had given evidence in the case. That is, the disappointed litigant could not seek to demonstrate that witnesses had given, or parties had suborned, perjured evidence or that witnesses or parties had conspired together to injure that litigant. Nor could the disappointed litigant seek to demonstrate that what was said by the witnesses had defamed that litigant. All such actions were precluded or answered by an absolute privilege. It mattered not how the action was framed. And it mattered not whether the disappointed litigant alleged that the witness had acted deliberately or maliciously. No action lay, or now lies, against a witness for what is said or done in court. It does not matter whether what is done is alleged to have been done negligently or even done deliberately and maliciously with  
        the intention that it harm the person who would complain of it.  
        The witness is immune from suit and the immunity extends to preparatory steps. 
         That the immunity must be pleaded as a defence makes it nonetheless an immunity from suit.” 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        What is important to notice for present purposes is not the history of development of this immunity, but that  
        both judicial immunity and the immunity of witnesses were, and are, ultimately, although not solely, founded in considerations of the finality of judgments 
        .” (Citations omitted) (Emphases added) 
        
       
      
    48 Their Honours continued at 19-20 [41]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Statements can be found in the cases that the immunity of witnesses serves to encourage ‘freedom of expression’ or ‘freedom of speech’ so that the court will have full information about the issues in the case. Statements also can be found that place the immunity of those who participate in court proceedings on the desirability of avoiding baseless actions being brought against those who were merely discharging their duty, but these considerations are advanced in answer to another kind of argument. As Fry LJ said in  
        Munster v Lamb 
        : 
         
         
          
          ‘Why is it that a judge who disgraces his office, and speaks from the bench words of defamation, falsely and maliciously, and without reasonable or probable cause, is not liable to an action? Is not such conduct of the worst description, and does it not produce great injury to the person affected by it? Why should a witness be able to avail himself of his position in the box and to make without fear of civil consequences a false statement, which in many cases is perjured, and which is malicious and affects the character of another?’ 
          
         
         
        The answer proffered (that it is more necessary to prevent the baseless action than provide for the kind of case described) may well suffice to meet the point.  
        But the deeper consideration that lies beneath the principle is that determining whether the complaint made is baseless or not requires re-litigation of the matter out of which the complaint arises 
        .” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    49 Their Honours considered that the notion of finality of litigation was “a fundamental and pervading tenet of the judicial system, reflecting the role played by the judicial process in the government of society”: at 21 [45].  
     
      
    50 In the joint judgment, their Honours, at 18 [39], stated that the immunity extends to “preparatory steps”. McHugh J, at 36 [99], said that the immunity “extends even to out-of-court conduct that is intimately connected with the giving of evidence in court”. Both judgments cited the case of Watson v M’Ewan as authority for that proposition.  
     
      
    51 In Watson v M’Ewan [1905] AC 480 Jessie M’Ewan brought proceedings against Sir Patrick Watson alleging that statements made by him while being examined as a witness were slanderous. Mrs M’Ewan alleged that the statements made by Sir Watson in evidence had been communicated to her husband, his agent and counsel, prior to the trial as part of the preparation for trial. The main question on the appeal was whether the statements previously communicated to Mrs M’Ewan’s husband, agent and legal counsel prior to giving evidence in the witness box, could be the basis of an action in slander, or whether witness immunity extended to the prior communication.  
     
      
    52 The Earl of Halsbury LC (Lord Justices James and Robertson agreeing) in dismissing the “ingenious suggestion” of Mrs M’Ewan, stated at 487: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is very obvious that the public policy which renders the protection of witnesses necessary for the administration of justice must as a necessary consequence involve that which is a step towards and is part of the administration of justice –  
        namely, the preliminary examination of witnesses to find out what they can prove 
        .” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    53 That the immunity extends that far is now well accepted. In Marrinan v Vibart & Anor [1963] 1 QB 528, the Court stated that the immunity extended to protect witnesses in the preparation of their evidence which was to be given in court.  
     
      
    54 The question remains however, as to how far back into the preparation stage the immunity reaches.  
     
      
    55 In Evans v London Hospital Medical College & Ors [1981] 1 All ER 715, the plaintiff had been arrested and charged with the murder of her infant son. The death was alleged to have been caused by morphine poisoning. The plaintiff’s arrest followed the results of toxicology tests that confirmed concentrations of morphine in the deceased’s organs. The toxicology reports confirming the presence of morphine were prepared by three of the defendants who were employed by the Hospital and which were given to the police and/or the DPP. Subsequent toxicological tests conducted by a pathologist acting for the plaintiff showed the organs to be free from morphine. 
     
      
    56 The plaintiff brought a claim for damages against the London Hospital Medical College and three individual defendants employed by the Hospital. The defendants brought motions to strike out the proceedings. Whilst conceding that the defendants had immunity in respect of any negligence after the criminal proceedings had commenced, the plaintiff argued that the negligent acts or omissions relied on occurred prior to the prosecution being commenced and were thus not protected by the immunity. 
     
      
    57 Drake J accepted that the cases established that a witness in criminal proceedings enjoys absolute immunity from any form of civil action in respect of evidence given during those proceedings and that such immunity extended to cover statements made in preparing a proof for trial or in a report to the DPP. The question for his Honour thereafter became whether the immunity extended to cover the acts or omissions of a witness or potential witness during the stage that material was being collected or considered with a view to its possible use in criminal proceedings.  
     
      
    58 His Honour, after stating that the immunity exists for the benefit of the public and the effective administration of justice, stated at 721: 
     
      
       
        
        “If this object is to be achieved I think it essential that the immunity given to a witness should also extend to cover statements he makes prior to the issue of a writ or commencement of a prosecution, provided that the statement is made for the purpose of a possible action or prosecution and at a time when a possible action or prosecution is being considered. In a large number of criminal cases the police have collected statements from witnesses before anyone is charged with an offence; indeed sometimes before it is known whether or not  
        any 
         criminal offence has been committed. 
         
         
        If immunity did not extend to such statements it would mean that the immunity attaching to the giving of evidence in court or the formal statements made in preparation for the court hearing could easily be outflanked and rendered of little use.  
        For the same reason I think that the immunity must extend also to the acts of the witness in collecting or considering material on which he may later be called to give evidence 
        .” 
          
        (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    59 Drake J considered that when the Court of Appeal in Marrinan v Vibart stated that the immunity extended to protect witnesses in the preparation of their evidence which was to be given in court, it intended to cover the collection and analysis of material to the offence or possible offence and was not confined to the formal proofs of a witness’ evidence.  
     
      
    60 Drake J held, therefore, that each of the defendants, at the time of preparation of the toxicology reports, was engaged in conduct which was part of the process of investigating a crime or a possible crime with a view to prosecution or possible prosecution. As a result, the defendants were protected by the immunity and accordingly no reasonable cause of action was shown to exist against them. In dismissing the appeal, his Honour did not give any separate consideration as to the basis upon which the immunity applied to the Hospital as compared to the individual defendants. This has some relevance to this case as the plaintiff separately pleaded against the Hospital that it owed a duty of care to ensure that the individual defendants carried out a proper analysis of the removed organs.  
     
      
    61 If Evans v London Hospital Medical College correctly states the law then it is likely that both AGAL and Mr Ballard would be protected by witness immunity, at least so far as it is invoked to protect the work done by Mr Ballard in analysing the seized substances. The question whether it does correctly state the law was examined by the House of Lords in Darker & Ors v Chief Constable of the West Midlands police [2001] 1 AC 435 with which I deal in detail below.  
     
      
    62 In X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council [1995] 2 AC 633, the House of Lords was concerned with a number of cases involving claims against a number of statutory authorities. The case relevant for the purposes of this case is M v Newham Borough Council. In that case, a psychiatrist, in the presence of a social worker, examined a child to ascertain whether the child had been sexually abused and if so, by whom. The psychiatrist produced a report which was tendered in evidence and used in proceedings for the removal of the child from the custody of her mother. It was subsequently discovered that the abuser was mistakenly identifed and the child was returned to the mother’s care. The mother brought a claim for damages for personal injury against the defendants, the local authority, the area health authority and the psychiatrist employed by the area health authority. The claims against the authorities were brought in their capacity as employers, such that if the psychiatrist was negligent it was alleged that they would be vicariously liable for the actions of the psychiatrist. 
     
      
    63 Lord Browne-Wilkinson (Lords Jauncey of Tullichettle, Lane, Ackner and Nolan agreeing), in considering witness immunity in relation to the conduct of the psychiatrist in providing the report, cited with approval the statements of Drake J outlined above at [58] in relation to the investigation and preparation of evidence in criminal proceedings. His Lordship stated at 755: 
     
      
       
        
        “… exactly similar considerations apply where, in performance of a public duty, the local authority is investigating whether or not there is evidence on which to bring proceedings for the protection of the child from abuse, such abuse frequently being a criminal offence … 
         
         
        In the present case, the psychiatrist was instructed to carry out the examination of the child for the specific purpose of discovering whether the child had been sexually abused and (if possible) the identity of the abuser. The psychiatrist must have known that, if such abuse were discovered, proceedings by the local authority for the protection of the child would ensue and that her findings would be the evidence on which those proceedings would be based. It follows in my judgment that such investigations having such an immediate link with possible proceedings in pursuance of a statutory duty cannot be made the basis of subsequent claims.” 
        
       
      
    64 As a result, his Lordship found there was no claim in damages available against the psychiatrist and it followed on his Lordship’s reasons, the local authority. This case also supports the immunity appying in this case.  
     
      
    65 Senior counsel for Mr Griffiths submitted, however, that the trial judge failed to properly distinguish between actions undertaken as part of the investigative phase, which is not protected by the immunity, and actions undertaken as part of the forensic phase, which are protected. Senior counsel’s focus in this regard was, as it had to be, specifically upon the case pleaded. It was submitted that the case pleaded included allegations directed at the investigative stage.  
     
      
    66 Evans v London Hospital Medical College and X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council were considered in Hillman v Black & Ors (1996) 67 SASR 490. That case involved a claim brought by a father against two doctors and the Department of Community Welfare alleging each had breached a duty of care in the examination of his child, whom, it had been alleged, he had sexually assaulted. 
     
      
    67 Matheson J accepted as correct the statement of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council set out at [63] above. His Honour considered that in the case before him, there was such immediacy with possible proceedings in pursuance of the Department’s statutory duty that the investigation of the two doctors could not be made the basis of civil proceedings at the suit of the father. In reaching this conclusion, his Honour examined the basis upon which each doctor had undertaken the examination of the child. The examination that was more remote from the institution of any proceedings was that undertaken by a Dr Black, who examined the child upon the request of the Department. His Honour noted, at 504, that 
     
      
       
        
        “The Department is charged under the Act with the responsibility of providing support services for children and with the care and protection of children. It is the Government agency to which certain persons, including medical practitioners, must notify their suspicions of abuse pursuant to the provisions of s 91. [Evidence was given] that it was a matter of departmental practice to inform the police if it was thought that sexual abuse might have occurred. Dr Black must have known that if sexual abuse was substantiated, and the identity of the abuser discovered, proceedings by the mother or the Department or both for the protection of the child, or criminal proceedings against the alleged abuser, or both Departmental and criminal proceedings, would ensue. Further, she must have known that her findings would be the evidence upon which such proceedings would be based … [Dr Black] must have been aware of the likelihood of Family Court proceedings, and the use for which her written reports would be used, either by the mother or by the Department.” 
        
       
      
    68 Prior J did not consider that the immunity applied on the basis that the doctors owed no duty of care because they were not within a relationship of proximity with the alleged perpetrator of the sexual abuse (cf now Sullivan v Moody [2001] HCA 59; (2001) 207 CLR 562, discussed below). Perry J did not find it necessary to consider that question. 
     
      
    69 In the present case, it was conceded that Mr Ballard was immune from suit in respect of the evidence he gave in the criminal proceedings. Senior counsel for Mr Griffiths submitted, however, that the evidence upon which the Court was acting did not permit a conclusion that all the steps taken by Mr Ballard, either before the issue of the certificate of analysis or after issuing the certificate, were steps taken as part of the steps preparatory to the evidence likely to be given at trial. Accordingly, the matter was not one that was appropriate for summary dismissal. In this regard, it was submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to analyse how the processes properly considered to be preparatory to trial related to earlier investigative processes, which may not be protected. It was submitted that his Honour failed to understand the fundamental distinction made in Darker & Ors v Chief Constable of the West Midlands police between these two processes.  
     
      
    70 In Darker & Ors v Chief Constable of the West Midlands police, the plaintiffs brought an action against the defendant claiming damages for conspiracy to injure and misfeasance in public office, alleging, inter alia, that the police officers had fabricated evidence against them. The defendant applied for the statement of claim to be struck out, claiming that the acts fell within the ambit of the immunity. There was no dispute that police officers who participated as witnesses in the course of proceedings were entitled to the benefit of the immunity. The question for determination related to the extent of the immunity and where the boundaries of its application were to be drawn.  
     
      
    71 Lord Hope of Craighead examined the existence of what he termed the “core immunity”, that is, the immunity that attaches to evidence given in the witness box, and recognised its extension to statements made by witnesses as part of the pre-trial preparation. His Lordship then stated at 448: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial process would be inhibited if police witnesses and potential police witnesses were to be exposed to action for things said or done by them during the preparatory stage when they are undergoing this preliminary examination.  
        The same approach can properly be taken to the preparation of technical reports by police officers with expertise in such matters as ballistics, explosives or fingerprinting 
        . As in the case of other expert witnesses, it would unduly inhibit the trial process if they did not have the protection of the immunity in regard to the  
        content of the reports  
        which they had prepared with a view to giving evidence should the matter come to trial. 
         
         
        But there is a crucial difference  
        between statements made by police officers prior to giving evidence and things said or done in the ordinary course of preparing reports for use in evidence,  
        where the functions that they are performing can be said to be those of witnesses or potential witnesses as they are related directly to what requires to be done to enable them to give evidence, and their conduct at earlier stages in the case when they are performing their functions as enforcers of the law or as investigators 
        .” (Emphases added). 
        
       
      
    72 His Lordship added that the question of immunity should not be confused with the question whether in particular circumstances a duty of care was owed by, for example, police or prosecutors. This latter question is, of course, discussed by the High Court in Sullivan v Moody, a matter to which it will be necessary to return.  
     
      
    73 His Lordship continued at 449: 
     
      
       
        
        “The purpose of the immunity rule is to protect the witness in respect of statements made or things done when giving or preparing to give evidence.  
        The acts of the witness in collecting material on which he may later be called to give evidence are not protected by the immunity 
        . The immunity extends only to the content of the evidence which the witness gives or is preparing to give based on that material.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    74 His Lordship accepted that the decision in Evans was correct on its own facts but he did not accept the statement of Drake J as being correct for all purposes. 
     
      
    75 His Lordship concluded that in these circumstances, where the allegations made in the statement of claim related not only to the content of the evidence that police officers might give, but also related, in part, to things done by them during the initial stage when they were acting as investigators, without hearing the evidence, it could not be confidently determined whether the allegations in the statement of claim fell within the boundaries of the immunity. Accordingly, his Lordship concluded that the question whether the immunity applied ought to be determined in the light of the facts as they emerged at the trial.  
     
      
    76 Lord Mackay of Clashfern at 452 stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The essential character of the immunity … limits the application of the immunity to conduct which can be called in question only by a founding on a statement in court or a statement which is part of the preparation of evidence for court proceedings.” 
        
       
       
      His Lordship held that the immunity did not apply on the facts of the case before the House. His Lordship then made reference to the decision of Drake J in 
       Evans 
       and concluded, at 452, that the decision did not extend the immunity to alleged negligent conduct not reflected in a written report or statement. His Lordship expressly rejected the statement of Simon Brown LJ in  
      Silcott v Commissioner of police of the Metropolis 
       (1996) 8 Admin LR 633, in which Simon Brown LJ accepted that Drake J was correct in holding that the immunity “ 
      covers all conduct that can fairly be said to be part of the investigatory … process 
      ”. It should be noted that Simon Brown LJ also considered that that conduct that properly could be described as part of the preparatory process also fell within the immunity. 
       
      
    77 It will be remembered that Darker involved the fabrication of evidence by police. That was a matter of significance in the approach taken by Lord Cooke of Thorndon. As his Lordship pointed out, at 453, none of the conduct alleged against the police as the basis upon which the plaintiff’s claim was brought, could fairly be described as part of the process of investigating a crime. As his Lordship said, the fabrication of evidence is “almost the antithesis of investigation; it is creation”. He endorsed Sir Thaddeus McCarthy P’s statement in Rees v Sinclair [1974] 1 NZLR 180 at 187, that the protection afforded by the immunity “should not be given any wider application than is absolutely necessary in the interests of the administration of justice …”. 
     
      
    78 Lord Cooke acknowledged that allegations of conspiracy to give false evidence fell within the immunity and referred to Marrinan v Vibart. See also Cabassi, which is discussed above at [44]-[45]. His Lordship recognised that there may be borderline cases where it is not easy to draw the line as to the precise extent of witness immunity. His Lordship considered, at 453-454, that in such cases, the determination of the question as to whether immunity applied: 
     
      
       
        
        “… may be helped to some extent by bearing in mind that witness immunity is a general doctrine applying to all persons called upon to give evidence, whereas the function of official investigation is limited to the police and various other public officials.  
        Conduct which is primarily and naturally to be seen as belonging to the investigatory function, even though it may have some ultimate link with the giving of evidence, should not be within the general protection 
        .” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    79 Lord Clyde, at 458, also confirmed the existence of the immunity in its traditional sense but went on to observe that the immunity would be worthless if it was confined to evidence given in court. He considered, therefore, that it extended to a statement of the evidence that a witness was going to give in court, regardless of whether the person was called as a witness. His Lordship was of the view that the same consideration, namely that the immunity should not be rendered worthless, applied to justify the application of the immunity to early stages of litigation or a prosecution where evidence was being collected with a view to proceedings being brought, or a prosecution being conducted. As his Lordship said at 459:  
     
      
       
        
        “It is then not enough that there be an investigation; the investigation must also be with a view to an action or to a prosecution which is already under consideration. Before that stage is reached it would be very difficult to justify the grant of an immunity. Even after that stage, if proceedings are commenced, it does not necessarily follow that all that is said or done in connection with the proceedings will be immune.” 
        
       
      
    80 Earlier, his Lordship had emphasised that the distinction between when the immunity applied and when it did not was whether the material in question was or was not provided with a view to court proceedings. His Lordship then considered the approach that should be taken in drawing the line between what was protected by the immunity and what was not. At 460, his Lordship indicated that it may be necessary to examine precisely what was being done and how closely it was linked with the proceedings in court. He stated that the immunity should not attach to things said or done which would not form part of the evidence to be given in the anticipated proceedings. His Lordship considered that the approach that he had formulated in determining what matters fell within or outside the immunity was underpinned by the purpose that the immunity was intended to serve, namely, the prevention of collateral attack on the witness and the circumvention of the immunity that that person might have within the court. Importantly, his Lordship added that the immunity did not protect against a charge of perjury, nor did it protect conduct that was designed to defeat the ends of justice, rather than to serve those ends. 
     
      
    81 Lord Hutton, at 466, referred to the statement of Lord Hoffman in Taylor v Director of the Serious Fraud Office [1999] 2 AC 177: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would be an incoherent rule which gave a potential witness immunity in respect of the statements which he made to an investigator but offered no similar immunity to the investigator if he passed that information to a colleague engaged in the investigation or put it to another potential witness. In my view it is necessary for the administration of justice that investigators should be able to exchange information, theories and hypotheses among themselves and to put them to other persons assisting in the inquiry without fear of being sued if such statements are disclosed in the course of the proceedings. I therefore agree with the test proposed by Drake J in  
        Evans v London Hospital Medical College (University of London) 
         [1981] 1 WLR 184, 192: ‘the protection exists only where the statement or conduct is such that it can fairly be said to be part of the process of investigating a crime or a possible crime with a view to a prosecution or a possible prosecution in respect of the matter being investigated.’ This formulation excludes statements which are wholly extraneous to the investigation – irrelevant and gratuitous libels – but applies equally to statements made by persons assisting the inquiry to investigators and by investigators to those persons or to each other.” 
        
       
      
    82 His Lordship stated at 469: 
     
      
       
        
        “The underlying rationale for the immunity given to a witness is to ensure that persons who may be witnesses in other cases in the future will not be deterred from giving evidence by fear of being sued for what they say in court. This immunity has been extended … to proofs of evidence and to prevent witnesses being sued for conspiracy to give false evidence.  
        But the immunity in essence relates  
        to the giving of evidence 
        . There is, in my opinion, a distinction in principle between what a witness says in court (or what in a proof of evidence a prospective witness states he will say in court) and the fabrication of evidence, such as the forging of a suspect's signature to a confession or a police officer writing down in his notebook words which a suspect did not say or a police officer planting a brick or drugs on a suspect. In practice the distinction may appear to be a fine one, as, for example, between the police officer who does not claim to have made a note, but falsely says in the witness box that the suspect made a verbal confession to him (for which statement the police officer has immunity), and a police officer who, to support the evidence he will give in court, fabricates a note containing an admission which the suspect never made. But I consider that the distinction is a real one and that the first example comes within the proper ambit of the immunity and the other does not.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    83 Lord Hutton’s judgment draws a distinction between fabricated evidence and a case where evidence was not fabricated. His Lordship also appears to distinguish Evans, as he commented at 466 that in Taylor’s case the House considered the test stated by Drake J in Evans in relation to statements, and not in relation to conduct, and no question arose as to the fabrication of evidence or the planting of evidence.  
     
      
    84 This review demonstrates that there are differences in the reasoning of the Lordships as to the extent of the application of the immunity. It is not appropriate for me to state for what the decision authoritatively stands. However, it appears to me that the following, at least, can be discerned. First, there is no doubt that the immunity extends beyond giving evidence in court. However, for the immunity to apply, there must remain a connection with the evidence that is to be given in court (regardless whether evidence is, in fact given). That latter proposition emerges from the reasoning of Lord Hope of Craighead. 
     
      
    85 Insofar as the various views expressed by their Lordships might be seen to apply to this case, no clear picture emerges. It is arguable that the reasoning of Lord Hope of Craighead may not protect Mr Ballard from suit, if the analyses undertaken (other than those upon which the certificate of analysis was based) are properly characterised as the collection of evidence. However, the better view of the early analyses and in particular, Mr Ballard’s analysis undertaken on 6 July 2003, the day before Mr Griffiths was charged, was part of what he was required to undertake to enable him to give evidence at the trial. It is possible that under Lord Hutton’s formulation the immunity would apply, provided that all of the analytical testing undertaken by Mr Ballard related to the giving of evidence. I consider this further below.  
     
      
    86 It is difficult to determine whether the immunity would apply on Lord Cooke’s reasoning, as it is unclear from his Lordship’s reasoning whether the early testing undertaken by Mr Ballard was part of the investigative phase. It is likely, subject to what I say below, that the immunity would apply on the basis of the approach taken by Lord Clyde, if the work Mr Ballard undertook from the beginning was undertaken with a view to a prosecution that was already under consideration. The immunity would not apply on the basis of Lord Mackay’s formulation of the extent of the application of the immunity.  
     
      
    87 However, senior counsel for Mr Griffiths placed particular emphasis on Lord Clyde’s observation that in circumstances such as here, where the immunity is sought to protect from suit in respect of conduct that occurred, at least, arguably, at the investigative stage, an investigation of all the facts is required to determine on which side of the “immunity” line a case falls. It was submitted that it was not so apparent that this case fell within the immunity such that it ought to have been summarily dismissed.  
     
      
    88 Senior counsel for Mr Griffiths reinforced this submission by reminding the Court that initially, a Mr Murtagh was involved in the process of determining the nature of the seized substance, so that it could not be assumed that Mr Ballard had been requested to undertake the analysis for the purposes of providing evidence in court. It was hypothesised that Mr Ballard may, for example, have been requested to provide confirmatory evidence as to the nature of the substance. 
     
      
    89 The difficulty with this submission is that it flies in the face of such evidence as there was before the Court which indicated that Mr Ballard was at all times providing certificates of analysis, albeit preliminary, of the substance to the police, and finally provided the certificate of analysis that was ultimately demonstrated to be inaccurate. Mr Ballard undertook his first analysis after the substances had been seized. Mr Griffiths was arrested the following day. His co-accused had already been arrested. It is apparent that the arrest, both of the co-accused and Mr Griffiths, was not a chance event. Rather, it may be inferred that it was as a result of an investigative process which was sufficiently advanced to enable the police to obtain warrants to undertake a search of the premises. The search was undertaken in the presence of Mr Murtagh. The police returned shortly after the original search and made the initial arrest of the co-accused. It may be inferred that in doing so, they had a reasonable suspicion that the seized substances were prohibited drugs. Whatever basis they had for that suspicion was not because of any testing undertaken by Mr Ballard.  
     
      
    90 Further, Mr Ballard was not in the process of investigating the commission of a crime. He was performing his task as an analyst for the purposes of providing an analyasis of the seized substances which had led to the arrest of Mr Griffiths and more significantly, to the earlier arrests of the co-accused. 
     
      
    91 In my opinion, Mr Ballard was not ‘investigating’ the crime alleged against Mr Griffiths. He was analysing a sample of a substance that had been seized from Mr Griffiths’ premises and which was to have been used in furtherance of a prosecution, if the substance was a prohibited substance. Lord Hope of Craighead’s remarks cited above at [73] make particular mention of people in Mr Ballard’s position and states they would be protected by the immunity.  
     
      
    92 The matter may be tested by considering it in this way. It seems that the certificate of analysis was not tendered in Mr Griffiths’ trial. Rather, he was called to give evidence and gave evidence of all of the tests that he conducted and the manner in which he conducted those tests. The action against Mr Ballard is based upon the manner he conducted those tests. Although Mr Griffiths has advanced a number of possible arguments as to why those tests may not have been carried out with a view to, or in furtherance of, the prosecution case, the fact is, Mr Ballard gave evidence of all of them. Nor was there any suggestion that the certificate of analysis was prepared other than as part of the steps preparatory to trial. And, in my opinion, there is no possible basis to suggest that his earlier or later testing was carried out for any other purpose unassociated with the prosecution. 
     
      
    93 The matter may then be tested further by having regard to the underlying rationale for the immunity. As was stated by the High Court in D’Orta-Ekenaike the immunity is founded ultimately in consideration of the finality of judgments. If this matter were to proceed to trial, it would involve a suit based upon negligent conduct of a series of tests carried out. Those tests were relied upon by the Crown for the purpose of proving that the substance found in Mr Griffiths’ possession was methcathinone. Mr Ballard gave evidence of all of the testing that he undertook. That could only have been relevant and admissible evidence if the whole of the testing was relied upon as proof that the substance was methcathinone. Accordingly, a trial based upon the negligent performance of that testing would involve the retrial, not only of the evidence given at trial but also of the preparatory steps taken to prove an essential ingredient of the charge brought against Mr Griffiths, namely, that the substance was the prohibited substance methcathinone.  
     
      
    94 It follows in my opinion, that even without resort to the English authorities, this case falls within the principle stated by the High Court as to the application of the immunity. When regard is had to the English authorities, then, on balance, the claim against Mr Ballard would have the protection of the immunity, on the basis of the principles discussed in those cases. 
     
      
    95 Before departing from this topic, I should mention that senior counsel for Mr Griffiths also relied upon a statement in the majority judgment in Mann v O’Neill [1997] HCA 28; (1997) 191 CLR 204 at 215, where their Honours held that it was not necessary that statements made to prosecuting authorities be absolutely privileged for the purposes of the law of defamation. Their Honours pointed out that the function of a prosecuting authority was not to determine the truth and justice of a particular matter, but to ascertain whether the circumstances were such that the institution of proceedings to ascertain the truth of the matter were warranted. It was held that absolute privilege was not required for the effective discharge of that function.  
     
      
    96 It was submitted that this approach was similar to the approach that had been taken in Darker, namely, that just as the defence of absolute privilege was not necessary to protect statements made to prosecuting authorities, likewise, the immunity was not necessary to protect steps taken during the investigative stage of proceedings. In taking that approach to the availability of absolute privilege in the law of defamation, the High Court in Mann v O’Neill emphasised, at 213, that the privilege should not be extended to statements that were said to be analogous to statements in judicial proceedings, unless there was a demonstrated necessity of the kind that dictated that judicial proceedings be absolutely privileged. 
     
      
    97 Mention should also be made at this stage to Meadow v General Medical Council where the question arose as to whether witness immunity, in whole or in part, operated so as to preclude disciplinary proceedings being taken against Professor Meadow in respect of evidence he had given in criminal proceedings refuting the proposition that the children of the accused (the mother of the victims) might have died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The English Court of Appeal remarked upon the reluctance of the courts to extend the immunity, noting at 477 [17] that when it did operate, the immunity is absolute. Sir Anthony Clarke MR (Auld and Thorpe LLJ agreeing) held that the immunity did not extend to the disciplinary proceedings that had been instituted against Professor Meadow: see also Scanlon v Director-General, Department of the Arts, Sport & Recreation [2007] NSWCA 204.  
     
      
    98 Accepting that the courts have been keen to ensure that the immunity is not unnecessarily or inappropriately extended, the application of the immunity to the claim against Mr Ballard does not offend that principle. For the reasons I have given, I consider that the claim falls within the normal application of the principle, so that Mr Ballard is not amenable to suit.  
     
      
    99 Having concluded that Mr Ballard is protected by witness immunity, the question then arises whether AGAL is protected by the immunity. I propose to consider that question in the first instance on the basis that AGAL, as his employer, is vicariously liable for his actions.  
     
      
       
      Witness immunity and vicarious liability 
       
      
    100 There has been significant judicial discussion as to the jurisprudential basis for the imposition of vicarious liability and as to whether an immunity extends to protect a person who is otherwise vicariously liable. In Darling Island Stevedoring and Lighterage Company Limited v Long [1957] HCA 26; (1957) 97 CLR 36, Fullagar J, at 57-58, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The rule is, in my opinion, rightly stated, as it always is, in terms of liability and not in terms of duty. The liability is a true vicarious liability: that is to say, the master is liable not for a breach of a duty resting on him and broken by him but for a breach of duty resting on another and broken by another. The notion of liability without breach of personal duty is not a legal impossibility. 
         
        
       
       … 
       
        
         
        The true position is, I think, finally made clear by the House of Lords in the important case of  
        Stavely Iron & Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Jones 
        . In that case Lord Morton of Henryton said: ‘My Lords, what the court has to decide in the present case is: Was the crane driver negligent? If the answer is ‘Yes', the employer is liable vicariously for the negligence of his servant. If the answer is ‘No', the employer is surely under no liability at all. Cases such as this, where an employer's liability is vicarious, are wholly distinct from cases where an employer is under a personal liability to carry out a duty imposed upon him as an employer by common law or statute. In the latter type of case the employer cannot discharge himself by saying: ‘I delegated the carrying out of this duty to a servant, and he failed to carry it out by a mistake or error of judgment not amounting to negligence'. To such a case one may well apply the words of Denning L.J.: ‘(The employer) remains responsible even though the servant may, for some reason, be immune'.  
        These words, however, are, in my view, incorrect as applied to a case where the liability of the employer is not personal but vicarious. In such a case if the servant is ‘immune’, so is the employer 
        .’” (Citations omitted) (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    101 Kitto J took a different view and stated at 60-61: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that ‘vicarious liability’ should be recognised as an example of transferred epithet, and as referring to a liability for vicarious acts: see per Denning and Hodson L.JJ. in  
        Broom v. Morgan 
        . The master's liability, when it exists, is not a liability substituted for that of the servant. It exists, I think, not because the servant is liable, but because of what the servant has done. It is a separate and independent liability, resulting from attributing to the master the conduct of the servant, with all its objective qualities, but not with the quality of wrongfulness which, in an action against the servant, it may be held to have because of considerations personal to the servant. The master ‘is to answer for the act as if it were his own’:  
        Dansey v. Richardson 
        . He is not to answer for the servant's liability, but for his act; and to say that one man must ‘answer’ for another's act implies that it was a wrongful act for the former to do.” (Citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    102 The position of Fullagar J has been subsequently endorsed by the High Court and followed in other courts. In Parker v The Commonwealth [1965] HCA 12; (1965) 112 CLR 295, the widow of Horace Stanley Parker, whose life was lost in the collision between the HMAS Melbourne and HMAS Voyager, brought an action on behalf of herself and a child, against the Commonwealth, claiming damages on the basis that her husband’s death was caused by the negligence of the officers and crew of the two ships and of other servants of the Commonwealth.  
     
      
    103 It was accepted in that case that members of the armed forces were not liable at the suit of another member of the armed services officers for negligent conduct engaged in during peacetime. However, that principle did not operate to preclude the bringing of a suit by a civilian. In the course of considering the vicarious liability of the Commonwealth in that circumstance, reference was made to the application of an immunity to a person whose liability was vicarious only.  
     
      
    104 Windeyer J at 300-301 stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whether the so-called ‘vicarious’ liability of a master for the tortious acts of his servant arises because the master is answerable for his servant's torts, or because the acts of his servant are imputed to him so as to make him himself liable in tort, has been much discussed and has provoked differing views, judicial and academic…however the principle of liability should be expressed, I think that the Commonwealth is only liable for the acts or omissions of a servant if the servant would himself be liable. In the recent case of  
        Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. v. Shatwell 
        , Lord  
        Pearce 
         said: ‘Unless the servant is liable the master is not liable for his acts; subject only to this, that  
        the master cannot take advantage of an immunity from suit conferred on the servant  
        ( 
        Broom v. Morgan 
        ).’ To the exception which his Lordship there mentions I shall refer later. (Citations omitted) (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    105 His Honour, at 303, rejected the statement of Lord Pearce (emphasised in the preceding quote) as to the application of an immunity where a party was vicariously liable. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I should add that I have considered whether the question of the liability of the Commonwealth can be separated from that of the liability of a member of the forces at the suit of a fellow member. Is the case one in which an immunity of the servant can co-exist with a liability of his master, the Commonwealth, thus bringing the topic into the same category as the much discussed case of  
        Broom v. Morgan 
          
        to which Lord  
        Pearce 
         referred in the passage I have quoted above?  
        I think not.  
        I recognise that there may to-day be grounds in social policy for allowing an immunity to Crown servants while subjecting the Crown to liability … But, as the law stands, that is not so.” (Citations omitted) (Emphasis added)  
        
       
      
    106 In Cowell v Corrective Services Commission of New South Wales & Anor (1988) 13 NSWLR 714 a former prisoner brought proceedings for false imprisonment against the Corrective Services Commission of New South Wales and a nominal defendant representing the Government of New South Wales. One of the questions that arose was whether the immunity of the prison’s governor destroyed the claim against the Commission where that claim was based on vicarious liability. 
     
      
    107 Clarke JA (Priestley JA agreeing) first referred to Darling Island Stevedoring and the continuing debate surrounding the theory of vicarious liability. His Honour then stated at 733: 
     
      
       
        
        “If there is no right to take action against the agent in respect of the conduct complained of then it seems to me to follow as a matter of principle that there is no right to take action against the principal in respect of that conduct … In the present case there never was a liability in the gaol governor in respect of the detention of the appellant and accordingly no basis for holding his principal liable for his acts. To conclude otherwise would be to undermine the very foundation of the traditional principle of vicarious liability.” 
        
       
      
    108 In De Bruyn v South Australia (1990) 54 SASR 231 the appellant brought proceedings against the respondent claiming damages for injury when she fell into an open culvert. The respondent sought to rely on s 29(1) of the Highways Act 1926 (SA), which provided  
     
      
       
        
        “No matter or thing done by the Commissioner or any inspector or other officer in good faith for the purpose of executing this Act shall subject the Commissioner, or such inspector or officer, to any liability in respect thereof”.  
        
       
      
    109 King CJ, in dealing with the question of whether the State could be vicariously liable notwithstanding s 29(1), stated at 235: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the law does not impose liability in tort upon the person perpetrating the act or omission said to constitute the tort, the State is not liable. This follows from the principles considered by Windeyer J in  
        Parker v Commonwealth  
        (1965) 112 CLR 295 at 300-302”. 
        
       
      
    110 In relation to whether s 29(1) operated to prevent what would otherwise be tortious conduct from amounting to a tort or merely protected persons from legal liability, the Chief Justice stated at 236: 
     
      
       
        
        “I see no relevant distinction between saying that a matter or thing done by a person in the postulated circumstances does not subject the person to any liability, including of course liability in tort, and saying that such matter or thing done by that person in those circumstances does not amount to a tort.” 
        
       
      
    111 However on this point, Legoe J at 245 stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “I would expressly disassociate myself with any suggestion that the availability of the limited defence to the Crown goes beyond the conferral of immunity from suit and operates to render the conduct non-tortious. Once the plaintiff has established the negligence alleged as a fact then her rights pursuant to s 10(1) of the  
        Crown Proceedings Act  
        permits her access to the courts. There is still ‘a tort’ established. The question (argued simply on the pleadings in these proceedings so far) then becomes a question as to whether the Crown is subject to any ‘liability in respect thereof’.” 
        
       
      
    112 In Bell v The State of Western Australia [2004] WASCA 205, one of the questions for the Court was whether, if an official was immune from liability, in that case by virtue of s 124 of the Western Australian Marine Act 1982 (WA), the State of Western Australia could nonetheless be vicariously liable for the official’s conduct. McClure J (Le Miere J agreeing) stated at [34]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The weight of authority as well as the general rejection of the master tort theory of vicarious liability supports the conclusion that an employer is not vicariously liable for the conduct of an employee in the exercise of his employment if the employee is immune from liability. Of course that outcome can be altered by statute.” 
        
       
      
    113 In contrast, EM Heenan J referred to the judgments of Kitto and Taylor JJ in Darling Island Stevedoring and stated at [68]: 
     
      
       
        
        “These observations in  
        Darling Island Stevedoring and Lighterage Company Limited v Long  
        are, strictly speaking  
        obiter  
        … Nevertheless, they constitute high persuasive authority for the proposition that a master may be vicariously liable for the actions or omissions, of his or her employee occurring in the course of employment independently of whether or not the employee is personally liable at law in respect of that same conduct.” 
        
       
      
    114 However, his Honour stated at [76]-[77]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The determination of the vital issue in this appeal therefore depends upon the resolution of highly persuasive  
        dicta 
         in the High Court coupled with established approaches to the strict construction of statutory provisions removing or reducing common law rights, on the one hand, and at least three decisions of intermediate courts of appeal which adopt and apply the proposition that the immunity of the employee results in the elimination of vicarious liability for the employer, unless expressly preserved. All this is against a background where those conclusions appear to depend, to a significant degree, upon the identification of an acceptable rationale for the doctrine of vicarious liability - a doctrine which is now regarded as being, if not opaque, at least not fully developed. 
         
         
        In such a situation, in spite of the uncertainties, I consider that I should follow the approaches established in  
        Cowell v Corrective Services Commission of New South Wales 
        ,  
        Robertson v R 
        , even if the conclusion in that latter case was based on a concession by counsel, and, most particularly, by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in  
        De Bruyn v South Australia 
        , notwithstanding the qualification expressed in that regard by Legoe J as already mentioned. Having made the choice to follow and apply those three authorities, it follows that this appeal should be dismissed.” 
        
       
      
    115 Contrary to the submission advanced on behalf of Mr Griffiths, there is a long line of authority (in which I include the obiter comments of Fullagar J in Darling Island Stevedoring and the statements made in Parker v The Commonwealth) that a person who is vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of another is protected by any immunity that is available to the actual wrongdoer.  
     
      
    116 It follows, therefore, based on this authority, that AGAL is protected from suit in respect of its vicarious liability for Mr Ballard’s conduct.  
     
      
       
      Witness immunity and direct liability 
       
      
    117 Mr Griffiths has alleged in his amended pleading that AGAL was negligent for failing to have in place proper procedures and protocols to ensure that testing was carried out accurately. AGAL contends that witness immunity protects it from suit in respect of such direct liability.  
     
      
    118 I am not aware of any authority directly on point, and so it is necessary to find the answer in the underlying rationale for the existence of the immunity, as discussed by the High Court in D’orta-Ekenaike, whilst keeping an eye to the injunction that the immunity is not to be readily extended. I have discussed that underlying rationale of the immunity in some detail above. It is fundamentally, although not solely, to ensure that there be finality of litigation. Having regard to that underlying rationale, what is the position in respect of the separately pleaded case against AGAL, that it failed to exercise reasonable supervision and control to ensure the accuracy of the analyses that were undertaken, and failed to provide an effective system of checking to ensure that AGAL’s protocols and standard operation procedures were consistently applied?  
     
      
    119 Mr Griffiths had two responses to this question. The first is that to which I have referred above, namely, that the immunity is one that attaches to witnesses, not parties. Secondly, it was submitted that because of the uncertainty surrounding the question, it was not one that should be determined summarily. AGAL contends that the immunity is not limited to witnesses and applies to its alleged direct liability.  
     
      
    120 The question whether the immunity does operate requires a consideration of what underlies Mr Griffiths’ case of alleged direct liability. If such a case was allowed to proceed to trial, it would be necessary for Mr Griffiths to prove that some or all of the analytical testing undertaken by Mr Ballard was conducted and/or reported upon negligently. It would then be necessary to adduce evidence to support the particular allegation made against AGAL in respect of its operational procedures and protocols. The first part of that exercise, namely proof of Mr Ballard’s conduct, was a matter that was the subject of the evidence in the criminal trial. The second part of that exercise has no independent existence. It would be an irrelevant enquiry if not related to the first stage. Accordingly, to allow the matter to proceed on the specific basis pleaded against AGAL would, in my opinion, offend the underlying rationale of the immunity. It follows that on this reasoning the immunity also applies to the specific case pleaded against AGAL in the particulars to para 17. It should also be noted that the separate case pleaded against AGAL was in similar terms to that pleaded in Evans, and which was dismissed on the basis that the immunity applies. Whilst that decision supports the conclusion that I have reached, I have preferred to reach my conclusion on the basis of the principles as they have been stated by the High Court, especially in D’Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid.  
     
      
    121 Thus far, I have been considering AGAL and Mr Ballard’s immunity from suit in respect of the pleaded claims in negligence. Mr Griffiths has also pleaded that AGAL engaged in conduct in breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and that Mr Ballard was knowingly concerned in that conduct. In my opinion, the immunity extends to those claims. There is nothing in the Trade Practices Act that provides a basis for excluding the immunity, and as the authorities have repeatedly emphasised, the immunity is absolute unless a matter falls within one of the recognised exceptions, or there is a clear statutory provision that excludes the immunity: see Jamieson and Brugmans at [46] above. There is no such clear statutory exception here.  
     
      
    122 These conclusions, namely, that the immunity applies to protect both Mr Ballard and AGAL from suit, mean that the appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed. However, as other issues were argued, and as my determination traverses virgin country, it is appropriate that I deal with those other issues.  
     
      
       
      Alleged Duty of care of AGAL: the  
      Sullivan v Moody 
       issue 
       
      
    123 Mr Griffiths alleges that AGAL owed a duty to exercise reasonable care: 
     
      
       
        
        “i. In the conduct of his analyses of, and so as to identify, the substance; and 
         
         
        ii. To fully and accurately advise the police or the DPP of the method and results of those analyses.”  
        
       
       
      The same duty was alleged against Mr Ballard. 
       
      
    124 The duty alleged to be owed by AGAL was particularised in para 17 to include a duty to exercise reasonable supervision and to have appropriate protocols to ensure the accuracy on the testing that was undertaken. 
     
      
    125 Mr Griffiths’ primary argument in respect of the question whether AGAL and Mr Ballard owed a duty of care was that that question could not be determined summarily. It was submitted that the relationship and the nature of the arrangements made between AGAL and the New South Wales police needed to be examined to determine whether the work undertaken by AGAL in relation to the analyses conducted by Mr Ballard was such as to give rise to a duty of care and if so, what the scope of that duty was. As Gummow J remarked in Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales v Dederer [2007] HCA 42; (2007) 81 ALJR 1773 at 1784 [43]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… duties of care are not owed in the abstract. Rather, they are obligations of a particular scope, and that scope may be more or less expansive depending on the relationship in question.” 
        
       
      
    126 AGAL contends that it owed no duty of care to Mr Griffiths. It was submitted that the duty of care as alleged against it was, properly characterised, a duty to control Mr Ballard’s exercise of the statutory power given to him under s 43 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act to undertake analysis of the seized substances and to issue a certificate of analysis. It was submitted that no such duty existed: see Sullivan v Moody, especially at 580-582 [60]-[62].  
     
      
    127 In Sullivan v Moody the High Court stated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[60] The circumstance that a defendant owes a duty of care to a third party, or is subject to statutory obligations which constrain the manner in which powers or discretions may be exercised, does not of itself rule out the possibility that a duty of care is owed to a plaintiff. People may be subject to a number of duties, at least provided they are not irreconcilable. A medical practitioner who examines, and reports upon the condition of, an individual, might owe a duty of care to more than one person. But if a suggested duty of care would give rise to inconsistent obligations, that would ordinarily be a reason for denying that the duty exists.  
        Similarly, when public authorities, or their officers, are charged with the responsibility of conducting investigations, or exercising powers, in the public interest, or in the interests of a specified class of persons, the law would not ordinarily subject them to a duty to have regard to the interests of another class of persons where that would impose upon them conflicting claims or obligations 
        .  
         
         
        [61] There is also a question as to the extent, and potential indeterminacy, of liability. In the case of a medical practitioner, the range of people who might foreseeably (in the sense earlier mentioned) suffer some kind of harm, as a consequence of careless diagnosis or treatment of a patient, is extensive.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    128 It was further submitted that the existence of such a duty owed to Mr Griffiths was inconsistent with the duty that AGAL owed to the prosecuting authorities, that duty arising out of the contractual relationship between AGAL and the New South Wales police. In particular, it was submitted that the duty was inconsistent with a duty to control what might be said about Mr Griffiths and the substances that he had manufactured, it being contended that such control was the proper provenance of the law of defamation. 
     
      
    129 In my opinion, no such duty of care arises. I have referred at [*27] to the long name of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act. The long name is instructive in understanding the purpose and object of the Act. The Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act is an act to prohibit the manufacture, supply, possession and use of certain drugs. A number of summary and indictable offences are created under the Act. Proof of the nature of any substance in respect of which an offence is alleged is a fundamental aspect in any prosecution brought under the Act. In that sense, AGAL, by the employment of analysts who are appointed by the Minister under the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act play an integral role in law enforcement. The emphasised portion of Sullivan v Moody at [60] quoted above is thus directly apt. Were it otherwise, law enforcement and prosecuting authorities would be liable for errors, including errors of judgment, or for malfunctioning equipment used for the purposes of carrying out their functions, including statutory functions. That would not only be contrary to the considerations stated by the High Court at [60], but is also likely to offend the notion that the recognition of a duty of care in such a circumstance would potentially give rise to indeterminate liability. 
     
      
    130 Further, in making the comment in the emphasised portion of [60], the High Court had examined a series of analogous cases: see the discussion at 581 [57]-[59] of Sullivan v Moody, pointing out that those decisions, although not determinative of whether a duty of care existed, were instructive. I do not propose in this judgment to set out those paragraphs, nor to separately analyse the decisions. It is sufficient, in my opinion, to note that the duty of care alleged here is sufficiently analogous to that which was alleged in those cases, to indicate that no duty of care is owed.  
     
      
    131 The same considerations apply to the duty of care alleged against Mr Ballard and for the same reasons Mr Ballard did not owe a duty of care to Mr Griffiths. 
     
      
       
      The Trade Practices issue 
       
      
    132 Mr Griffiths alleges that AGAL carried on the business of providing forensic services, including scientific and chemical testing, analysis and advice as to the results of those testing and analyses. He alleges that the giving of the certificate of analysis certifying that the analysed substance had been identified as methcathinone was misleading within the meaning of the Trade Practices Act, was conduct engaged in during the course of trade or commerce within the meaning of the Act and was in contravention of s 52 of the Act. Mr Griffiths has alleged as against Mr Ballard that he was knowingly concerned in the contravention. 
     
      
    133 AGAL contends that the representation made in the certificate of analysis as to the nature of the substance was not made in trade or commerce. It otherwise accepted that it was arguable (which was sufficient for the purposes of the application before the Court) that in providing the certificate of analysis by way of, or as part of a service provided to the police, that it was carrying on a business within the meaning of s 2A of the Trade Practices Act. It was also accepted, for the purposes of the application before the Court, that the giving of the certificate of analysis was within trade or commerce (on the basis that the provision of the certificate would have been for a fee). The question, therefore, is whether the contents of the certificate of analysis, that is the representation contained in the certificate of analysis that the substance was methcathinone, was made in trade or commerce. AGAL relied on the decision in Plimer v Roberts & Anor (1997) 80 FCR 303 in support of this opinion. I will turn to that decision shortly. Before doing so, it is convenient to turn to the High Court’s decision in Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Limited v Nelson [1990] HCA 17; (1990) 169 CLR 594.  
     
      
    134 In Concrete Constructions, the respondent, a construction worker, alleged that whilst employed by the appellant, a foreman instructed him to remove certain grates and informed him that each grate was secured by bolts. It was alleged that that was not so, and the respondent fell when one of the grates gave way, suffering serious injuries. He claimed damages against his employer on the basis that its foreman's untrue statement concerning the bolts was conduct which was misleading or deceptive or liable to mislead or deceive contrary to s 52 of the Trade Practices Act.  
     
      
    135 The majority (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ) held at 603-604 that s 52 was not intended 
     
      
       
        
        “… to extend to all conduct, regardless of its nature, in which a corporation might engage in the course of, or for the purposes of, its overall trading or commercial business … What the section is concerned with is the conduct of a corporation towards persons, be they consumers or not, with whom it (or those whose interests it represents or is seeking to promote) has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character … In some areas, the dividing line between what is and what is not conduct ‘in trade or commerce’ may be less clear and may require the identification of what imports a trading or commercial character to an activity which is not, without more, of that character. The point can be illustrated by reference to the examples mentioned above. The driving of a truck for the delivery of goods to a consumer and the construction of a building for another pursuant to a building contract are, no doubt, trade or commerce in so far as the relationship between supplier and actual or potential customer or between builder and building owner is concerned. That being so, to drive a truck with a competitor’s name upon it in order to mislead the customer or to conceal a defect in a building for the purpose of deceiving the building owner may well constitute misleading or deceptive conduct ‘in trade or commerce’ for the purposes of s. 52. On the other hand, the mere driving of a truck or construction of a building is not, without more, trade or commerce and to engage in conduct in the course of those activities which is divorced from any relevant actual or potential trading or commercial relationship or dealing will not, of itself, constitute conduct ""in trade or commerce"" for the purposes of that section. That being so, the giving of a misleading handsignal by the driver of one of its trucks is not, in the relevant sense, conduct by a corporation ""in trade or commerce"". Nor, without more, is a misleading statement by one of a building company's own employees to another employee in the course of their ordinary activities.” 
        
       
      
    136 That brings me back to Plimer, upon which AGAL specifically relied. In that case, the Court was concerned with a number of representations made by Dr Roberts in the course of public lectures given throughout Australia, as to the existence of the remnants of Noah’s Ark at a site in eastern Turkey. Dr Roberts believed this provided tangible evidence of the literal truth of the account of the great flood in the book of Genesis. Professor Plimer, geologist, claimed to be affronted by these claims, which he said were misleading or deceptive. The question arose whether the representations made in the public meeting were made in trade or commerce within the meaning of the Trade Practices Act. 
     
      
    137 Davies J, at 305, considered that the subject matter of the lectures in which the misleading and deceptive statements occurred, was not in trade or commerce. His Honour considered that the subject matter itself was non-commercial in character and although there were monetary incidents to the lectures, such as entry fees and the sale of videos, the lectures were not concerned with commerce, but rather with the promotion of a creationist view of history and the investigation of a matter of great historical interest. Relevantly, the lectures were not given for the purpose of financial gain but for the achievement of other objectives. The lectures had been arranged by volunteers and his Honour considered that the audience would have attended because of an historical or religious interest in the matter. Further, Dr Roberts received no payment for the lectures and it was not suggested that in giving the lectures he was carrying on the profession of author or speaker. 
     
      
    138 Branson J, after referring to the High Court decision in Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Limited v Nelson [1990] HCA 17; (1990) 169 CLR 594 considered that the phrase “trade or commerce” indicated, at 311, that s 52 was concerned with “commercial activity”, that is, the provision of goods and services for reward.  
     
      
    139 Lindgren J, at 327, considered that the delivery of the lectures was not inherently a trading or commercial activity. His Honour accepted that there could be features of a lecture or address which could impart to the making of a representation in the course of doing so, the quality of being “in trade or commerce”. His Honour gave, by way of example, a case where the misrepresentation was characterised as directed to promoting the sale of goods or services. However, that was not the case in the matter before him. 
     
      
    140 Plimer v Roberts was referred to in Monroe Topple & Associates Pty Ltd v Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia (2002) 122 FCR 110, where Heerey J observed that the Full Court in Plimer v Roberts noted the distinction between the selling of door tickets, videotapes and the like in relation to the lectures on the one hand, and the content of what was said in the lectures. His Honour remarked that the former was accepted to be conduct in trade or commerce, the latter was not. 
     
      
    141 The demarcation in this case is not so immediately obvious. The provision of the certificate of analysis was the service, or part of the service, provided to the prosecuting authorities. The certificate, of course, has no significance unless it has a content. In that way, it might arguably be said that the provision of the certificate, including its content, was conduct engaged in trade or commerce. However, there are at least two indications to the contrary which lead me to conclude that the conduct involved in the issue of the certificate was not conduct engaged in trade or commerce. The first consideration derives from the statutory force of the certificate, namely, that it may be used in evidence in legal proceedings, including criminal proceedings, and as such, has prima facie evidentiary effect. It would be unusual for the content of such a certificate to have the incidents of a commercial activity. The second (which I recognise may be related to the first and may merely be a different expression of it) is that where the conduct which is relied upon involves what I will describe as ‘witness conduct’ and that conduct is the very matter about which a person may be required to give evidence as a witness, then such conduct does not have the necessary connection with ‘commercial activity’ as to fall within the concept of ‘trade or commerce’ within the meaning of the Trade Practices Act. 
     
      
    142 I would conclude, therefore, that the representation made in the certificate of analysis was not made in trade or commerce. For that reason also, the claim under the Trade Practices Act ought to be dismissed. 
     
      
    143 I would therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      2. Cross-appeal dismissed; 
       
       
      3. Set aside the following orders made by Rothman J: 
       
       
       (i) order (a); 
       
        
        (ii) order (b) insofar as Rothman J quashed the orders of Master Harrison made on 25 August 2004; 
         
        (iii) order (d) dismissing the application of the second defendant (the Commonwealth of Australia) for a stay of proceedings; 
         
        (iv) order (e) ordering the second defendant (the Commonwealth of Australia) to pay one third of the costs of the plaintiff (Mr Griffiths) on the motion before Master Harrison and on appeal to Rothman J; 
        
       
       
      4. (a) vary order (1) made by Master Harrison so that the order now made is that the proceedings against the first and second defendants (Mr Ballard and the Commonwealth of Australia) are dismissed; 
       
        
        (b) confirm order (2) (in respect of costs) made by Master Harrison; 
        
       
       
      5. Order that the plaintiff (Mr Griffiths) pay the costs of the first and second defendants (Mr Ballard and the Commonwealth of Australia) on the appeal before Rothman J; 
       
       
      6. Order that the plaintiff (Mr Griffiths) pay the costs of the second defendant (the Commonwealth of Australia) on the appeal and of the first defendant (Mr Ballard) on the cross-appeal. 
       
      
    144 YOUNG CJ in Eq: I have read the reasons of Beazley JA in draft and agree with her Honour and with the orders she proposes. I should, however, add a few comments of my own. 
     
      
    145 I have been greatly disturbed by this case as it would seem to the man or woman in the street that if an employee of the Commonwealth whom the community relies on for scientific accuracy, deliberately tampers with his or her scientific instruments to produce a false result knowing that such result may have drastic consequences for a person, that person should be able to sue. 
     
      
    146 In the instant case, such tampering is suggested on one version of the respondent’s case. I hasten to point out that, if the matter were able to go to trial, the tribunal of fact might reach the result that there was no tampering. 
     
      
    147 The consequences for the respondent in the present case were severe. A person in his seventies with health problems, and a person who apparently has an unblemished character was imprisoned for two and a quarter years in respect of an offence of which he was ultimately acquitted. 
     
      
    148 There is a clear public policy that witnesses in curial proceedings have immunity in respect of their evidence and in respect of what they did in preparing to give evidence. The immunity is in place primarily to protect the court system from abuse, rather than to confer a benefit on the witness, Cabassi v Vila (1940) 64 CLR 130, 141. 
     
      
    149 There are dicta in some of the English cases that fabrication of evidence lies outside the immunity, see eg per Lord Hutton in Darker v Chief Constable of West Midlands [2001] 1 AC 435, 469 and per Clarke MR in Meadow v General Medical Council [2007] QB 462,475-6. 
     
      
    150 However, in Cabassi, it was made clear that the policy was that subsequent action for fabrication of evidence or perjury was to be left to the criminal law and that all conduct of witnesses was covered by the immunity. In D’Orta-Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid (2005) 223 CLR 1 at 18 and 36 the High Court affirmed this approach. 
     
      
    151 As her Honour has said, the authority in this country makes us reach the conclusion that Mr Ballard has immunity. 
     
      
    152 As to the suggested vicarious liability of the Commonwealth for the acts of Mr Ballard, the authorities do not speak with one voice. However, the preponderance of them is that an employer cannot be vicariously liable for an employee’s action where the employee is not liable. This must be so in the case where the employee is not liable because, by statute or otherwise, he or she is deemed not to have sinned. 
     
      
    153 The exception is where there is some personal factor which protects the employee. The prime example is Broom v Morgan [1957] 1 QB 597 (and see the discussion of this case by Windeyer J in Parker v The Commonwealth (1965) 112 CLR 295, 301-3) where under the then law in England, a wife, injured by the negligence of her husband, could not sue the husband, but could sue his employer. 
     
      
    154 The present case is not in the personal factor category as the authorities cited by her Honour demonstrate. I would add to these Prince v Attorney-General [1996] 3 NZLR 733, 741, a case involving a situation not too dissimilar to the present. 
     
      
    155 The only other comment I need to make is that whilst I agree that the present claim should be struck out under the traditional test laid down in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (1964) 112 CLR 125, 129, I wish to reserve the position I tentatively took during argument that the overriding purpose stated in s 56 of the Civil Procedure Act, 2005 may well warrant courts striking out proceedings on less substantial grounds than those stated in General Steel.

    The applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to import 20 times the minimum commercial quantity of ecstasy tablets. After discounts for his plea and for assistance given to the authorities he was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 7 years 3 months. The principal argument in support of his application for leave to appeal was that he had been given an inadequate discount for his assistance to the authorities. The sentencing Judge found that his assistance was significant but not major and he was not likely to give further assistance in the future. These findings were based on the Crown's decision that his evidence at committal exculpating two of his co-accused was not reliable and he would not be called to give evidence in the Crown case against them. The applicant argued that his evidence exculpating two of his co-accused was reliable and that the Court should delay giving judgment until the result of the appeal of one of the co-accused from his conviction had been determined.Held: (1) The Court would not defer judgment to await the outcome of the other appeal; 
     
      
       
      (2) The discount for assistance to the authorities should be determined on an objective and pragmatic basis; 
       
       
      (3) If the authorities reject proffered assistance then, to that extent, there is no basis for a discount; 
       
       
      (4) The Court cannot be expected to undertake collateral inquiries into the guilt or innocence of third parties in order to evaluate assistance offered by the prisoner but rejected by the authorities; 
       
       
      (5) The outcome of the appeal by the co-accused against his conviction, even if successful, would not support the applicant's case for a greater discount for assistance offered to the authorities.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY AJA: This is an application for leave to appeal from the sentence imposed by Woods DCJ on the applicant who pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to import narcotic goods being a commercial quantity of ecstasy contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and s 11.5 of the Criminal Code (Cth). The goods comprised 164,462 tablets weighing 31.95 kilograms containing 10.44 kilograms of pure ecstasy. This was 20 times the minimum commercial quantity. The tablets had a potential retail value of up to $11.4 million.  
     
      
    2 The tablets were hidden in the insulation of six refrigerators in a consignment of 54 in a container which left the United Kingdom by sea in November 2003. The container was unloaded in Melbourne in December and transferred to a warehouse. Customs, who had been alerted to the shipment, removed the drugs and replaced them with harmless tablets before allowing the importation to proceed. The container was taken by road to Sydney and delivered on 17 December 2003 to a warehouse in Botany that had been leased for this purpose.  
     
      
    3 The applicant’s associates were removing the supposed drugs from the relevant refrigerators when the Federal Police intervened and they were arrested. The applicant who had left the area shortly before was then arrested. The principal in the whole affair was a Mr King who lived in the United Kingdom. His deputy in Sydney, Mr Henry, was arrested shortly afterwards. 
     
      
    4 The applicant pleaded guilty at committal on 14 May 2004 and despite some later equivocation, maintained his plea. The Judge imposed a sentence of 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and 3 months to date from 17 December 2003 when the applicant was taken into custody. The maximum was imprisonment for life. The sentence was moderate given the applicant's knowledge and managerial role, and the quantity and value of the narcotic goods involved.  
     
      
    5 The Judge took as his starting point a sentence of 18 years imprisonment but allowed a discount of 20 per cent for what he said was relevantly an early plea. The applicant had given significant assistance to the authorities, including giving evidence at the committal proceedings against his co-conspirators, and swearing affidavits for the extradition proceedings against Messrs King and Salhani, the conspirators resident in the United Kingdom. The Judge had the benefit of a confidential exhibit detailing the assistance given to the authorities which has been made available to this Court. He concluded that the applicant’s assistance, although significant, was not major and he was not likely to give further assistance in the future.  
     
      
    6 In his evidence at committal and at trial the applicant attempted to exculpate Messrs Swansson and Alkarim, who he had recruited for the importation, because, as he said, they were not aware that illegal drugs were involved. The Crown decided that this evidence was not truthful. It did not call him to give evidence at the trials of his co-conspirators but tendered him for cross-examination. 
     
      
    7 The Crown cross-examined the applicant as an adverse witness at the trial of those accused. The jury convicted them and must have rejected his evidence. An appeal by Swansson to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the ground that his conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory has not yet been heard. Alkarim has not challenged his conviction.  
     
      
    8 The Judge allowed a discount of six years or 33⅓ per cent for the plea of guilty and the assistance to the authorities. Counsel for the applicant submitted that the allowance for assistance of 13⅓ per cent was appellably inadequate and the combined figure should have been of the order of 40 per cent or more. Counsel for the Crown was correct in submitting that the discount for assistance can be assessed as a fraction or proportion of the sentence discounted for the plea of guilty and on this basis the discount was 16⅔ per cent. This approach is supported by R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 para [70] per Howie J and the case there cited.  
     
      
    9 The applicant gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence as well as at the trial of his co-accused before the same Judge. The sentencing Judge was therefore in a position of advantage in evaluating the Crown’s decision that the applicant was not a reliable witness and should not be called in future to give evidence for the Crown.  
     
      
    10 The considerations which are relevant when fixing the discount for a plea of guilty, such as the presence of genuine contrition, are also relevant when fixing the discount for the provision of assistance, and care has to be taken to prevent this overlap leading to double counting when fixing the discounts: R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220, 227-8 per Gleeson CJ and R v El Hani [2004] NSWCCA 162 paras [66] - [68] per Howie J.  
     
      
    11 The applicant also argued that the Judge had failed to take into account or give sufficient weight to the evidence in report form from a psychiatrist Dr Allnutt. The Judge said that he had taken into account the applicant's mental condition (remarks p13) and had considered Dr Allnutt's report. He was satisfied that the applicant had a history of depressive illness ""not amounting to a major mental illness"", and that it was probable that at the time of the offence he was ""somewhat affected by depressive mood disorder"".  
     
      
    12 He appeared at the time to be quite rational and the Judge considered that his nervousness was due to an awareness of the risks he was running. In these circumstances any moderation called for was modest: R v Wright (1997) 93 ACR 48. There is nothing in the sentence to indicate that the Judge failed to give this matter proper weight.  
     
      
    13 The Judge found that the applicant's role was limited to arranging the importation and organising the warehouse where the tablets would be removed from the refrigerators. However these acts were at the heart of the offence, and the fact that he was to have no role in the marketing did not diminish his criminality for the offence charged.  
     
      
    14 The applicant relied on the sentence subsequently imposed by the Judge on the co-conspirator Henry to support a parity argument. The Judge said that although their roles were quite different they were comparable. Henry’s role was to arrange the marketing, and the telephone transcripts showed his managerial involvement in the conspiracy. He said that the intended marketing was “merely an aspect of the conspiracy to import”.  
     
      
    15 The Judge said he had been careful to confine the sentence imposed on Henry to the offence for which he had been found guilty by the jury. His ultimate conclusion in Henry’s case was that the criminality of the applicant and Henry was approximately the same. 
     
      
    16 In sentencing Henry the Judge took as his starting point a sentence of 18 years which was the same as that for the applicant. As the Judge said, Henry had pleaded not guilty, in the face of overwhelming evidence, had not cooperated with the authorities, and was not entitled to the discounts allowed to the applicant. However he was a UK citizen who would be serving his sentence in a foreign gaol a long way from home and for this reason his non-parole period was reduced from 12 to 11 years. This Court set aside Henry's conviction on technical grounds and ordered a new trial and the sentence which was the foundation for this argument no longer exists.  
     
      
    17 There was no breach of the parity principle, given the finding that the overall criminality of the applicant and his co-accused were comparable. Each had a managerial role. The Court is not entitled to disturb those findings.  
     
      
    18 There remains for consideration the applicant's challenge to the adequacy of the discount for his assistance to the authorities. The Judge rejected the Crown's submission that his assistance should be rated as only moderate. He held, as has been noted, that it was significant although not major and the applicant was not likely to give further assistance in the future.  
     
      
    19 The applicant's principle submission was that his evidence exculpating Swansson and Alkarim was truthful. The Judge was therefore in error in devaluing his assistance and in finding that there would be none in the future.  
     
      
    20 The Judge said (remarks p 11): 
     
      
       
        
        ""Because of various stories that he has told, a mere reading of the telephone conversations themselves, not to mention the offender's own admission of inventing false names and using false names and so on, gives a flavour to his evidence which the Crown would no doubt find unhelpful were he to be called upon as a prosecution witness in any future proceedings."" 
        
       
      
    21 The applicant's evidence about his association with Alkarim and Swansson given during his cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor (T 14/9/05 pp 1126-1167 AB 719-760) shows that the Crown had good reasons for not relying on his evidence. He was cross-examined at the trial after he was sentenced but the transcript was before us without objection.  
     
      
    22 At the conclusion of the oral hearing on 5 April this year the Court intimated that it would defer giving judgment until the decision of this Court, differently constituted, in the appeal by Swansson. This had been fixed for hearing on 1 June. This date and a subsequent hearing date were vacated and the appeal is now fixed for hearing on 13 February 2009. 
     
      
    23 Although the applicant is not responsible for the delays this Court has decided that further delay is unacceptable and judgment should now be given without waiting any longer for the decision in Swansson. 
     
      
    24 At the time, and without the benefit of argument or reflection, the result in Swansson's appeal was thought to be arguably relevant to the applicant's challenge to the adequacy of the discount for his assistance to the authorities.  
     
      
    25 The discount allowed for assistance to the authorities is for assistance that is accepted and used by them. The value of that assistance, and the discount to be allowed, are to be determined on objective and pragmatic grounds. If the authorities reject the proffered assistance, and it is not used, the prisoner will have given no assistance in the result and will not be entitled to any discount on that basis. In such a case the prisoner may be entitled to a greater discount for his plea of guilty but only if the sentencing Judge is able to find on the civil onus that his proffered assistance was honest and truthful.  
     
      
    26 If the prisoner is prepared to give evidence that X is guilty but Y is not and the Crown believe that both are guilty and decide not to call the prisoner he will not, to that extent, have given assistance to the authorities. In such a case the Court cannot be expected to undertake a mini trial of the guilt of Y in the course of the sentencing proceedings in order to fix a discount for assistance where, rightly or wrongly, there was none in fact.  
     
      
    27 A decision by this Court that Swansson's conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory, and that he should be acquitted would not necessarily establish that he was in fact innocent. Nor would it necessarily establish that the applicant's evidence which exculpated him was truthful. The acquittal could be the result of evidence by the applicant which was false.  
     
      
    28 For these reasons the result in Swansson's appeal, even if successful, should not affect the present application which otherwise fails. Accordingly I propose that the following orders be made: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal granted; 
         
         
        2. Appeal dismissed.

    3 HARRISON J: The appellant was found guilty by a jury on 13 May 2004 on a charge that he imported into Australia a prohibited import consisting of a quantity of cocaine not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to cocaine contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901. The appellant has appealed against that conviction and applies in advance of his appeal for an extension of time within which to do so. 
     
      
    Background 
     
      
    4 On Friday 27 December 2002 the appellant arrived at Sydney airport on Emirates flight EK 410 from Dubai. He passed through the immigration primary line and collected his baggage. He was subsequently escorted to a baggage examination area for the purpose of conducting a baggage search. The appellant was asked some questions about his luggage and the answers given by him to questions on the Incoming Passenger Card (“the IPC""). The appellant admitted completing the IPC and said that he was fully aware of the contents of his luggage. The appellant gave an address in Bondi on the IPC as his residential address in Australia. 
     
      
    5 As part of his search the Customs officer searched a black toiletries bag that contained a plastic shampoo bottle. He noticed that the bottle was harder than he had expected. He asked another Customs officer to test the bottle while he continued to search the appellant's luggage. He then took the appellant's suitcase to a nearby x-ray machine for scanning. 
     
      
    6 The officer examined the contents of the appellant’s wallet, which the appellant had taken from his pocket. He located receipts from two pawnbrokers in Colombia. He put these aside for further examination and they were subsequently photocopied by another Customs officer. Preliminary tests were conducted showing a positive result for the presence of cocaine in the shampoo bottle. The appellant was then taken to an interview room adjacent to the baggage search area. 
     
      
    7 During the events in the interview room, which were recorded on videotape, the original Colombian receipts were returned to the appellant. The Australian Federal Police were contacted and requested to attend the interview room to take the appellant into custody. During this time, on the Crown case, the appellant secreted the original Colombian receipts under the table in the interview room where they were discovered by another Customs officer four days later. 
     
      
    8 The appellant was subsequently arrested and charged with the offence for which he was ultimately convicted. 
     
      
    9 The shampoo bottle was later examined and dismantled on 30 December 2002. It was found to contain three plastic bags within which was located 415g of a white powder. An analysis by the Australian Forensic Drug Laboratory revealed that the purity of the cocaine was 72.4 per cent amounting in weight to a total of 300.4g of pure cocaine. The wholesale value of the cocaine in Australia was estimated at $30,000. The street value was estimated at $120,000. 
     
      
    10 The address in Bondi given by the appellant was subsequently discovered to be false. The tenant had been living at the address since October 2002 and did not know the appellant. One of the owners of the property informed the police that the appellant had leased the premises in April 1999 for a term of 12 months but vacated them in February 2000. 
     
      
    11 Ceyhun Kucuk had been in custody with the appellant following his arrest. Mr Kucuk and the appellant spoke to each other in Turkish over a period of about five to six months. Their conversations included discussion of the charges against the appellant. The appellant told Mr Kucuk that he had gone to Turkey with lots of cash and that he wanted to buy drugs there but that they were too expensive. Accordingly the appellant had travelled to Colombia in order to purchase cocaine there. He told Mr Kucuk that the price of cocaine in Colombia was between $500 and $1000 per kilo compared to US $30,000 per kilo in Turkey. The appellant had taken cocaine back to Turkey and used some of it there. He had wanted to bring half a kilo of cocaine to Australia with him. He brought it in a shampoo bottle. 
     
      
    12 The appellant described to Mr Kucuk how he had cut the bottle, emptied it, put the cocaine in a plastic bag, put the cocaine into the bottle with the shampoo on top and then glued the bottle back together. The appellant also said that he had arranged for a poor person who needed the money in Turkey to take the blame if he got caught. That person in Turkey was to receive $20,000 - $10,000 when he gave evidence to the police and $10,000 for his family. Mr Kucuk said that the appellant had told him, however, that something had happened to that person and that he had to organise another person in his stead. As a result the appellant had asked Mr Kucuk to ask someone to make a call to his parents to organise that. 
     
      
    Grounds of appeal 
     
      
    13 The appellant relied upon eight grounds of appeal. Ground 1:  
     
      
      A miscarriage of justice has occurred with the failure of the Crown to call crucial and relevant witnesses (which will prove [the appellant's] innocence):- 
       
        
         
        (a) Mr Fikri Akar (this person has confessed to Turkish authorities and taken full blame for the crime [the appellant] has been charged with; 
         
         
        (b) Mrs Semra Bulut (eyewitness, she seen [sic] Mr Akar's friend, Glodya, who switched the shampoo bottle in [the appellant's] luggage; 
        
       
        
       
        
         
        (c) Mr Ilhan Akca (privy to alleged conversation between Mr Ceyhun Kucuk and [the appellant]; 
        
       
        
       
        
         
        (d) Mr Kennedy (prison guard in reference to the letter from Mr Kucuk). 
        
       
      
    14 Mr Akar is alleged to have told foreign authorities that he was responsible for placing the cocaine in the appellant's bag. According to the appellant's submission, he has been charged and sentenced in Turkey for that crime. 
     
      
    15 Ms Semra Bulut was a witness to Glodya Evalina allegedly switching the shampoo bottle that contained the shampoo with the appellant’s own Pantene shampoo bottle that had been in his luggage the day before he left Turkey. Ms Bulut gave a statement that was read into evidence by the defence at the trial. 
     
      
    16 The existence of each of these people and the proposition that each could have given evidence relevant to the trial of the appellant in fact formed the basis of the appellant's stay application on 29 April 2004. That application was based upon an affidavit of his then solicitor. The affidavit and the documents that are annexed to it tended to show that Mr Akar had initially told Turkish prosecuting authorities in May 2003 that he had given 450 g of cocaine to a Romanian woman and that he ""later found out that she put it in the bag of a man by the name of Vural Can who was caught in Australia”. The appellant's father had made this allegation to Turkish authorities, which in turn sought to detain Mr Akar for interrogation. By the time of the trial Australian Federal Police enquiries had confirmed Mr Akar's apprehension but not much else. This is discussed in more detail below. 
     
      
    17 Prior to the appellant's first trial, which resulted in a hung jury, there had been correspondence between the parties in which the Crown had declined to meet the costs of a video link to take evidence from witnesses in Turkey. This obviously included Mr Akar and Ms Bulut. The Crown contended that such witnesses ought properly to be regarded as defence witnesses. The attitude of Legal Aid to meeting the costs of a video link had fluctuated before it ultimately declined to fund the appearance of witnesses from Turkey. 
     
      
    18 In argument about the prosecution's refusal to call such witnesses in its case in the stay application, the trial judge indicated her view that the ""evidence"" in question, even if it were available, was ""fanciful"", ""unreliable"" and ""inherently incredible"". In her Honour's judgment on the stay application, she concluded that almost all the evidence that might be given by these witnesses amounted to hearsay, with the exception of the observations allegedly made by Ms Bulut about what she saw Glodya Evalina doing with the appellant's suitcase. Her Honour also concluded that the Crown's decision that it lacked any obligation to call the witnesses was well founded: see R v Kneebone [1999] NSWCCA 279; (1999) 47 NSWLR 450. The Crown's obligation did not extend to the investigation of every potential witness or theory raised by the defence. 
     
      
    19 Her Honour concluded that s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 provided a mechanism by which the evidence of Ms Bulut and Mr Akar might have been made available in the defence case in any event. In due course a revised statement of Ms Bulut dated 7 May 2004 was admitted as exhibit 4. The statement of Mr Akar was rejected on various grounds that are not presently contested by the appellant. 
     
      
    20 The appellant made the following submissions in support of his criticism of the prosecution’s failure to call Mr Akar and Ms Bulut: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am expressly adopting the contention that the witnesses and their statements were relevant to my defence, furthermore my submission is that there was no "" 
        basis 
        "" for the non-disclosure of the witnesses and their statements. 
         
         
        The Crown cannot and should not by law use the doctrine as a device to avoid calling witnesses when they are available, the makers of the statements. Thus to deprive the defence of the opportunity to cross-examine them would not be consistent with the fundamental duty of the prosecution to place all relevant material and facts before the Court, so as to ensure that justice is done properly in accordance with the law. 
         
         
        However the Court did not deal with this evidence suggesting that I was being set up or framed. It is submitted that the failure to deal with this issue is a "" 
        denial 
        "" of procedural fairness to the defence."" 
        
       
      
    21 At the heart of the appellant's submission in support of this ground is the statement, contained in the appellant's written submissions, that Mr Akar had stated to foreign (presumably Turkish) authorities that he was mainly responsible for placing the cocaine in the appellant's bag without the appellant's knowledge. The appellant states further that Mr Akar had been charged and sentenced in Turkey for that matter. I discuss below what may be the significance of those matters if established. However, it should be noted for present purposes that the evidence did not establish either of these things. 
     
      
    22 The relevant material in this respect is the statement of Mr Akar which the appellant attempted to get into evidence and which her Honour rejected. It is instructive to set out the relevant portions of that statement which are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""2. On 30 May 2003, I gave an interview at the Sincan Public Prosecutors Office in Sincan, Turkey. . .  
         
         
        3. During that interview, I confessed to being involved in a conspiracy with Glodya Evalina to place cocaine in the luggage of Vural Can before he returned to Australia in December 2002. 
         
         
        4. Glodya provided me with money, and told me where I could buy the cocaine. I then went and purchased the cocaine from where she told me. This was in Taksim in Istanbul. The man I bought the cocaine from was a shoe polisher near the Taksim Post Office, in other words, at the park across from the Marmara Hotel. The cocaine cost three billion liras. I paid the money in three instalments over one month. The first payment was five hundred million liras. 
         
         
        5. I saw Glodya a few days before Vural was due to leave for Australia. At this time, I gave her the cocaine. 
         
         
        6. I have now been charged with being an accomplice in the offence of trafficking and possessing drugs under s 403/5 of the  
        Turkish Criminal Law. 
          
         
         
        7. I am not in custody at the moment, but when my case is finalised I expect to go to gaol."" 
        
       
      
    23 That statement does not in terms establish or even imply that Mr Akar was “mainly” responsible for placing the cocaine in the appellant's bag, or indeed that he was responsible for doing so at all. Moreover, the statement makes it clear that Mr Akar had not been sentenced, and presumably also not convicted, prior to the date of the appellant's trial when the admissibility of the statement was being considered by her Honour. 
     
      
    24 I am unable in the circumstances to discern any error that occurred at the trial, or any associated miscarriage of justice, that may have flowed from a failure by the Crown to call either Mr Akar or Ms Bulut.25 The appellant's submissions concerning Mr Akca arose in the following way. It was part of the Crown case at the trial that the appellant had admitted his guilt to Mr Kucuk, a fellow inmate with him in gaol, and that part of the admission included the statement by the appellant that someone had been paid $20,000 to confess to the crime in Turkey: see par [12] above. The Crown argued, therefore, relying on Mr Kucuk’s evidence, that the suggestion by the appellant that someone in Turkey had been convicted of ""loading him up"" could be disregarded. On the contrary, the appellant contended that the Crown refused to call Mr Akca, an inmate in Parklea Prison with both Mr Kucuk and the appellant, who had overheard what had allegedly been said by the appellant to Mr Kucuk, and whose evidence would have demonstrated that Mr Kucuk's evidence of the appellant’s admissions was false. According to the appellant's case, this would then mean that the conviction of Mr Akar in Turkey (if that is what occurred) was genuine, thus showing that the appellant had been wrongly convicted. 
     
      
    26 Apart from the circularity of the reasoning, there are at least four problems with this. First, there is no evidence to establish that Mr Akar had in fact been convicted of anything at all, let alone of an offence allegedly related to the circumstances leading to the appellant's ultimate conviction. The appellant drew the attention of this Court to a series of documents, translated from Turkish, which can be accepted as records of criminal proceedings from time to time in that country. However, none of these documents is particularly helpful and, most importantly, none appears to be conclusive of any of the matters for which the appellant presently contends.  
     
      
    27 Secondly, even if it could be established that Mr Akar had been convicted in a Turkish court, whether with or without the assistance of the translated documents, Mr Akar's guilt was not necessarily co-extensive either with the appellant's innocence or a miscarriage of justice at his trial. There is no evidence that any part of Mr Akar's “conviction”, or any ""confession"" allegedly given by him upon which his conviction may have been based, goes as far as to exculpate the appellant or to demonstrate that he was set up as a result of some criminal conspiracy in Turkey before he left.  
     
      
    28 Thirdly, the appellant's sister Serpil Can gave evidence in the Sincan Criminal Court in Turkey on 31 October 2005 suggesting that Mr Akar was ""definitely not the person before the court”. She said:  
     
      
       
        
        “I have never seen the accused that is before the court. Fikri Akar (had earlier) told me, by giving another name that he is an acquaintance of my brother and I gave evidence in Mugla Criminal Court in this regard but the person who is before the court at present is not the person who spoke with me. But my father Huseyin Can knew most of my brother Vural Can’s friends. When he saw the person before the court in Sincan as my brother's friend and when he established that he stays in a hotel, he reportedly lodged a complaint in the Office of the Prosecutor, saying ‘this is the person who framed up my son’, this person was reportedly apprehended. But the person who came to me was not this person. My father has passed away. He was suffering from Alzheimer's disease therefore could not recognize the people that much therefore he might have made a mistake. (He was) definitely not the person before the court, because the eyes of the person who spoke with me and was saddened by my brother's situation, and was my brother's friend, were green. I wish he was, so we could tender the statements of the accused to the court in order to get my brother released"". 
        
       
      
    29 Although there was some dispute as to precisely what this evidence meant, it appears to cast doubt upon the identity of the person ""arrested"" or ""convicted"" in Turkey in the way contended for by the appellant. 
     
      
    30 Fourthly, and perhaps most significantly, a statement given by Mr Ilhan Akca on 18 November 2005 (which for present purposes can be accepted as a statement of evidence that he would have been prepared to give at the trial) does not on its face mean that the evidence given by Mr Kucuk was false. It may mean that the evidence given by Mr Kucuk about the presence of Mr Akca was false. However, the very terms of the statement given by Mr Akca indicate that his evidence, taken at its highest, could only have availed the appellant at his trial to the extent that it may have contradicted Mr Kucuk’s evidence that Mr Akca was present when the appellant made the relevant admissions to Mr Kucuk. Mr Kucuk did not say that he had only ever had conversations with the appellant at times when Mr Akca had been present. His evidence would have left on foot the possibility that the appellant had made the admissions to Mr Kucuk about which Mr Kucuk gave evidence, in Mr Akca’s absence. In the words of the Crown's submission, ""Mr Akca's apparent denial of having heard [the appellant] say the things attributed to [him] by Mr Kucuk does not advance consideration of whether the conversations between the two men occurred in the terms of which Mr Kucuk gave evidence”. 
     
      
    31 Finally, with respect to Mr Kennedy, the appellant did not identify what evidence Mr Kennedy could have given that may have been relevant to the issues in his trial. Mr Kennedy was apparently a Corrective Services officer to whom the appellant referred in his evidence at transcript 239-240. It was Mr Kennedy who gave the appellant the retraction letter purporting to be from Mr Kucuk, which became exhibit 3 in the appellant's case at trial. The appellant received this letter in an envelope from Mr Kennedy. The envelope had no stamp; it was what was described as ""inter-gaol"" mail. Mr Kennedy's name appears in handwriting on the bottom of the letter but it is not suggested that he witnessed it. There was no issue in the trial about the circumstances in which the letter came to be in the possession of the appellant. There was no reference to Mr Kennedy other than in the evidence referred to above, and no direction was sought at the trial in relation to his absence or his failure to give evidence. In the circumstances it is unsurprising that Mr Kennedy was not called as a witness at the trial. 
     
      
    Ground 2:  
     
      
      Failure of the judge to grant a permanent stay due to (a) inadequate funding and (b) inadequate disclosure of materials, evidence and witnesses. 
       
      
    32 The appellant's stay application was based partly on the ultimate refusal of Legal Aid to pay for the attendance of the Turkish witnesses. The appellant argued by analogy with the reasoning in Dietrich v The Queen [1992] HCA 57; (1992) 177 CLR 292 that ""an accused person is denied a fair trial if relevant witnesses, through no fault of the accused, not giving evidence in the trial"": see par [13] of the applicant’s submissions in support of his application for a stay of proceedings. 
     
      
    33 The Crown argued before her Honour and reiterated in this Court that there was no authority for any such proposition. In any event, her Honour concluded that s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 provided a mechanism for the admission of otherwise admissible material from the Turkish witnesses which ultimately led to the admission of Ms Bulut’s statement as exhibit 4 in the appellant's case at the trial. The first limb of this ground is not made out. 
     
      
    34 During the course of submissions in this Court, the appellant acknowledged that the second limb of this ground of appeal was not an allegation of a failure by the Crown adequately to disclose its case but rather a reiteration of an allegation of failure by the Crown to lead evidence from the Turkish witnesses. This was, in effect, a re-agitation of Ground 1. It is unnecessary to deal further with this aspect.Ground 3: 
     
      
      An unfair trial occurred by virtue of inadequate disclosure of material evidence by Crown and/or abuse of process when the Crown intentionally and deliberately withheld material evidence that was consistent with the (defence) thereby denying the accused the opportunity to put this material before to [sic] the jury, resulting in a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      
    35 This ground of appeal is also a repetition of Grounds 1 and 2(b). It requires no further consideration in the light of the acknowledgement referred to earlier.Ground 4:  
     
      
      Judge's failure to give proper  
      Jones v Dunkel 
       direction in regard to the witnesses: 
       
        
         
          
         
         
        (a) Mr Ilhan Akca 
         
         
        (b) Mr Kennedy 
         
        
       
      
    36 As has been discussed above, Mr Akca was in custody for a period at the same time as the appellant and Mr Kucuk. Mr Kucuk gave evidence in cross-examination that in his statement to police he had said that Mr Akca was present when he was having ""these conversations"" with the appellant. Part of that evidence was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. And in that statement do you agree that you said that there was another person present when you were having these conversations with [the appellant]? 
         
        A Yes sir. 
         
         
        Q. That was Mr Akca, is that right? 
         
        A Yes. Ilhan Akca. 
         
         
        Q. And when you say present, obviously you mean that he was there and he would have heard the conversations wouldn't he? 
         
        A Not all the time. 
         
         
        Q. Well he was there enough to hear enough of the conversations to know what you were talking about wasn't he? 
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q. He should be able to corroborate what you say shouldn't he? Do you understand what I'm saying? 
         
        A Yes. He should, because [the appellant] and Ilhan Akca was standing in the same cell. They were cellmates."" 
        
       
      
    37 The appellant's evidence was that he shared a cell for a period with Mr Akca. In the context of denying that he had made any admissions to Mr Kucuk, the appellant said that he ""was mostly talking to Mr Akca”. 
     
      
    38 Earlier in the case Federal Agent Ferreira had agreed in cross-examination that Mr Kucuk had said that Mr Akca was present while the allegedly incriminating conversations with the appellant had taken place in gaol. Mr Ferreira agreed that he had not spoken to Mr Akca, that he believed him no longer to be in custody, that Probation and Parole would have been able to tell him where Mr Akca was, but that he had not asked that service to track him down. 
     
      
    39 In his closing address, counsel for the appellant, apparently referring to this issue, said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""There hasn't been a proper investigation. Inquiries haven't been responded to or they haven't been followed up. Witnesses who, even the officer-in-charge has conceded, would be worth talking to haven't been spoken to and apparently in one case they're still intending to talk to a person. Apparently the Australian Federal Police are telling you, ""Oh yeah, there is a witness out there we intend talking to, but we haven't done that yet. We'll do it sometime in the future"". I mean, the trial is concluding, the trial finishing now. What does that make you feel about the level of the quality of the investigation in this matter?"" 
        
       
      
    40 Counsel for the appellant at the trial made no submission about any inference to be drawn from the failure to call Mr Akca. 
     
      
    41 When her Honour came to this issue in her summing up she dealt with the absence of any supporting evidence for Mr Kucuk in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""To the extent that there is no supportive evidence, then to that extent you would be less likely to accept the evidence that he has given. In this case there is no such supportive evidence available. You know that it is Mr Kucuk's evidence that there was one other prisoner present when the admissions were being made, but you also know from the evidence of Federal Agent Ferreira that the police have not interviewed that person and no such evidence from that person has been called. 
         
         
        You are not entitled to speculate about what that person might have said if they were called to give evidence. The accused puts to you in relation to this aspect of the Crown case, that the fact that the Federal Police have not interviewed that person, is an example of sloppy investigation, and that has meant a degree of unfairness to the accused has arisen, because that person's evidence may have been useful.  
        If you agree with that argument and you agree that there is some unfairness to the accused, you are entitled to take that into account overall in assessing the Crown case 
        , but you are not entitled to speculate about what may or may not have been the evidence of this person in looking at the reliability of Mr Kucuk's evidence."" 
        
       
      
    42 The Crown complained to her Honour about her use of the italicised words in the quote from her summing up. This led to an argument, which included some reference to Jones v Dunkel, but which was resolved by the Crown suggesting a form of words which would inform the jury that it could take the fact that Mr Akca was not called into account in assessing Mr Kucuk's evidence. Counsel for the appellant initially accepted the Crown's suggested form of words but later qualified that, eventually saying, ""I’ve just indicated my preference is to leave it, for it to be left so as not to draw any further attention to it and perhaps give it greater significance"". 
     
      
    43 Her Honour indicated that she would use a form of words similar to those suggested by the Crown. Therefore, later in her summing up, in reference to the failure by the police to interview Mr Akca, her Honour said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""But you are entitled to take into account the fact that that person has not been interviewed and is not here to give you evidence in assessing whether or not you accept Mr Kucuk as being a witness of truth beyond reasonable doubt."" 
        
       
      
    44 Although these words were consistent with what the Crown had suggested, they were on one view overly favourable to the appellant. The Crown submitted that this was not the case in which a Jones v Dunkel comment adverse to the Crown should have been made: see Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45; (2002) 210 CLR 285 per Gaudron and Hayne JJ at [6], [17] and [18]; Chahine v R [2006] NSWCCA 179 at [48]-[49]. There had been no relevant enquiry. In any event, the Crown submitted that this was a case in which Rule 4 should apply. 
     
      
    45 In my opinion, no miscarriage of justice has taken place. The relevant issue was whether or not the jury might reasonably have accepted as truthful the evidence given by Mr Kucuk in the absence of an explanation of a failure by the Crown to call someone who was apparently present at the time. Mr Akca’s presence or absence as a witness was irrelevant to the substance of the evidence given by Mr Kucuk that inculpated the appellant. Mr Akca's presence or absence as a witness was confined narrowly to the question of whether or not the appellant and Mr Kucuk could have had an opportunity to speak without him being present. The significance of Mr Akca (if any) would not even have been apparent if it had not been for the fact that Mr Kucuk himself had made reference to him. Furthermore, the evidence of Mr Kucuk revealed that the relevant conversations that he allegedly had with the appellant could have taken place in the absence of Mr Akca: he was not there ""all the time"". Finally, her Honour’s summing up in my opinion wholly neutralised any possible injustice to which the appellant could point in this Court. 
     
      
    46 Nor am I able to identify any injustice to the appellant as the result of an omission by the trial judge to comment upon an alleged failure by the Crown to call Mr Kennedy as a witness at the trial. 
     
      
    Ground 5:  
     
      
      Failure of the judge to give adequate direction: re prison informer’s evidence (Mr Kucuk). 
       
      
    47 No specific failure has been identified by the appellant in his submissions. Her Honour dealt comprehensively with Mr Kucuk's evidence. Her Honour gave warnings required by s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 and in accordance with the issues raised with respect to prison informers in Pollitt v The Queen [1992] HCA 35; (1991-2) 174 CLR 558 and R v Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396 at 405-407. Counsel for the appellant raised no complaint with her Honour at the time. The appellant has demonstrated no error. This ground of appeal fails.Ground 6:  
     
      
      Unfair and bias [sic] summing up. 
      
    48 Similarly, no specific failure has been identified by the appellant in his submissions. Counsel for the appellant raised no complaint with her Honour at the time. The appellant has demonstrated no error. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    Ground 7: 
     
      
      Judge’s allowing evidence of consciousness of guilt re: invoices found under the table. 
       
      
    49 The evidence at the trial revealed that after a search of the appellant's baggage, two receipts were found in his wallet. The receipts were from Colombian pawnshops, one in the sum of US $800 and one in an amount, which was the equivalent of approximately US $200. Later, in the interview room at the airport, the receipts that had been taken from the appellant were returned to him and he placed them in his wallet. The appellant was subsequently taken from the airport and charged. 
     
      
    50 Four days later another customs officer found the receipts stuck under the table in the interview room. It was the Crown case at the trial that the only way that the receipts could have come to be in that position was if the appellant had put them there. A video recording of what took place in the interview room showed that the appellant had the opportunity to do so after the receipts had been returned to him and that he must have done so out of a consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    51 The appellant gave evidence about the receipts, saying that one in his name was obtained when he pawned a bracelet for US $800 in order to obtain money to permit him to continue gambling at a Bogotá casino. The appellant said that the second receipt was written in the name of a woman whom he had met at the casino and who had lent him US $150, also to permit him to continue to gamble. The appellant said that he gave the woman his ring, in effect as security for the debt, which she had subsequently pawned, returning the receipt to him before he left Colombia. 
     
      
    52 The appellant said in cross-examination that the bracelet was worth about US $1400 - US $1500 and that the ring was worth about AUD $500. He agreed that there was a shortfall between the money he had obtained for these items and their true value, which he did not seek to recover before leaving Colombia leaving both items in hock. When asked by his counsel at the trial whether he had put the receipts under the table in the interview room, he replied: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I can't exactly recall I might have done it but I can't recall I probably chucked it in there because they took the photocopy of all of them and give it back to me and I didn't need that receipt any more. So I probably chucked it there. I don't remember specifically sticking it under the table but I probably chucked it there or dropped there, I can't exactly remember."" 
        
       
      
    53 In cross-examination the appellant repeated that he had probably dropped the receipts there but could not remember doing so. The Crown submitted that the applicant did not offer any sensible explanation for how the receipts came to be found under the table. The Crown relied upon the hiding of the receipts as evidencing a consciousness of guilt. The Crown submitted in this Court that it was appropriate for her Honour to direct the jury in relation to these events in accordance with Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 210-211. 
     
      
    54 No complaint was made on behalf of the appellant about this evidence at the trial. I was initially attracted to the proposition that her Honour's direction concerning it may have been suspect, in the sense that the facts did not support a finding of a consciousness of guilt, for the reason that it made no sense for the appellant to seek to dispose of the receipts when he did, having regard to the fact that they had been taken from his possession at the airport and photocopied. However, it seems clear that the appellant was not made aware of the fact that the receipts had been photocopied until much later and, relevantly, at a time after he had left the interview room. Disposal of the receipts by the appellant in circumstances that may well then have appeared to the appellant to amount to their loss or destruction for all purposes is significantly different to a disposal of the receipts for what would have amounted to no good purpose. 
     
      
    55 In my opinion the evidence was not wrongly admitted and no miscarriage of justice has been identified.Ground 8:  
     
      
      Failing to refer to the evidence given by the accused. 
      
    56 The appellant makes no particular submissions in support of this ground. No complaint was made on behalf of the appellant at the trial that would support this ground of appeal. This ground of appeal also fails.  
     
      
    Application for extension of time to appeal 
     
      
    57 The appellant filed a notice of intention to appeal on 8 June 2004 and received an extension of time in which to file his notice of appeal and other documents, which expired on 20 December 2004. From that time until a lodgement of the current application dated 11 May 2007, there was no contact with the Court. 
     
      
    58 A letter from the appellant accompanying his application contained the following paragraphs: 
     
      
       
        
        ""As you can appreciate and understand quite a substantial amount of time has elapsed almost 3 years, since my notice of intention to Appeal was lodged on the 7th June 2004. 
         
         
        The time delay was a situation beyond my control, mainly, the inactions of my then legal counsel in them not preparing and lodging my Appeal, therefore and under the circumstances your consideration for an expedient date for call over and hearing would be greatly appreciated."" 
        
       
      
    59 The Notice of Application for Extension of Time for Notice of Appeal dated 11 May 2007 contained the following explanation of the delay: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Firstly, a notice of intention to appeal was lodged by me on the 7th June 2004 and I was advised by CCA that it had been listed, with a 6 month time limit. I was also advised by my then lawyers that an extension application had been forwarded, but I have since found out this was not the case, therefore I have been put at a significant disadvantage and I should not be held responsible for my then lawyers failures; then secondly, due to my lawyers inaction from the beginning and the run around I was given by my then lawyers in reference to the Turkish Authorities has also contributed to the delays. 
         
         
        I am an innocent man and I, as a matter of Justice seek the Court courtesy in granting special leave and an extension of time so I can have the opportunity to put my case before the Court."" 
        
       
      
    60 It becomes necessary from time to time for this Court to give consideration to applications for extensions of time in various contexts. Such applications should be, and are, considered on their merits having regard to the nature and extent of the delay, the explanation proffered by the applicant for the delay and any other matters which appear to be relevant. I would not, by the granting of an extension of time to the present applicant, wish to be taken as endorsing the proposition that an application as sparsely supported as the present one would be sufficient or adequate for the purposes of this Court in considering whether or not to grant it. In my opinion, the applicant has not demonstrated why in the circumstances of the present case the extension of time that he seeks should be granted. It will in any event be apparent from my consideration of the various grounds of appeal that if an extension of time were granted, I would have dismissed the appeal. 
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    61 The application for extension of time to appeal is refused.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CL at CL: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    2 HALL J: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    3 PRICE J: Andre Carvahlo was found guilty by a jury following a trial in the District Court of a single count of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61 I of the Crimes Act 1900. On 14 December 2006 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 8 years to date from 13 October 2006 and to expire on 12 October 2014. A non-parole period of 5 years 4 months which expires on 12 February 2012 was fixed. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence.  
     
      
    4 An offence contrary to s 61 I of the Crimes Act is punishable by imprisonment of up to 10 years. A standard non-parole period of 7 years has been prescribed.  
     
      
    5 The notice of appeal identifies two grounds each of which complains that the sentence is excessive. During oral argument, Mr Conomos confined the appeal to the length of the non-parole period. The feature of the case upon which this contention is founded is the evidence of Dr Neville Howard, a senior specialist in endocrinology and senior physician in diabetes.  
     
      
    6 The applicant had been diagnosed with type one diabetes at the age of nine. Dr Howard informed the sentencing Judge that the applicant had suffered frontal lobe damage during a severe hypoglycaemic episode in 1994. He was then fourteen years old. He had permanently lost some of the frontal lobe functions and as a consequence had intellectual and behavioural difficulties. The doctor suggested that the applicant would have difficulty understanding what is right and wrong. There was nothing that could be done by way of surgery or medication or a combination of both, Dr Howard said, which could correct the frontal lobe damage. However, he suggested that there might be room for him to have a current psychiatric assessment by an expert in that field. 
     
      
    7 Following Dr Howard’s evidence, Mr Conomos conferred with him and then informed the sentencing Judge that the doctor felt (POS 14/12/06 p 21 L19-25): 
     
      
       
        
        “One, that there should be a direction that the offender seek and receive treatment from the psychiatrist dealing with frontal lobe syndrome with a view to appropriate management strategies. And two, that upon release the offender should either report at the Young Adult Diabetes Centre at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital or the Young Adult Diabetes Centre at Westmead.” 
        
       
      
    8 Mr Conomos argues before this Court that the sentencing Judge in fixing the non-parole period did not give Dr Howard’s evidence the emphasis that it deserved and a lesser non-parole period should have been imposed to permit the applicant to have treatment in the terms recommended by the doctor. 
     
      
    9 It is appropriate to observe that the sentencing Judge did not accept Dr Howard’s evidence that the applicant would have difficulty in understanding what is right and wrong. There was before his Honour evidence in the form of reports from a forensic psychiatrist Professor David Greenberg that the applicant did not suffer any mental disability and from Dr Olav Nielssen a psychiatrist that it was unlikely that the applicant suffered from, or was affected by, a hypoglycaemic attack around the time of the alleged offence. In particular, what occurred was inconsistent with confusion surrounding a hypoglycaemic episode. The sentencing Judge said (ROS at 16): 
     
      
       
        
        “What was of particular concern to me was Dr Howard’s evidence that in his view, he, the offender, would have difficulty in understanding or differentiating right from wrong. My concern about that is, notwithstanding the expertise that Dr Howard brings to his evidence, that expertise is in the context of somebody who is not a psychiatrist. I am left with the clear evidence from both Dr Nielssen and Professor Greenberg as to the situation of the offender’s mental capacity which was the basis on which the trial proceeded and indeed these sentencing proceedings took place.” 
        
       
      
    10 At an earlier stage in his sentencing remarks, the Judge had considered the evidence of Dr Jane Holmes-Walker, an endocrinologist and specialist in diabetes, who had expressed the view that the applicant was not hypoglycaemic at the time of the commission of the offence.  
     
      
    11 Where the evidence of witnesses conflict it is a matter for the Judge at first instance to determine which evidence is to be preferred. The applicant does not submit that there is error by his Honour in the preference expressed for the evidence of the psychiatrists. His Honour did accept Dr Howard’s evidence that the applicant had sustained permanent damage to the front lobe area of his brain.  
     
      
    12 It has long been established that the existence of a mental illness may be of relevance in the sentencing task in a number of ways. Where mental illness is causally related to the offence committed the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced: R v Hamid (2006) 164 A Crim R 179 at [94]; Apps v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 290 at [53]. It may also be a factor which reduces the weight to be given to general deterrence: R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81 at [86]; R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at [71]; or the need for personal deterrence of the offender: Scognamiglio at [85]. 
     
      
    13 The existence of a disability, falling short of mental illness, which impacts upon the cognitive or behavioural functioning of an offender may give rise to similar considerations in the sentencing process. In the present appeal, however, the applicant does not contend that the sentencing Judge failed to appropriately assess the applicant’s moral culpability for the offence nor the need for general deterrence and the consideration does not arise.  
     
      
    14 The question, as confined by Mr Conomos, for this Court to determine is whether there was any error in the weight given by the sentencing Judge to the applicant’s need for treatment and hence his rehabilitation in the light of the acceptance that the applicant had frontal lobe damage.  
     
      
    15 His Honour, it is clear, assiduously considered Dr Howard’s evidence and the applicant’s need for treatment and rehabilitation. It is evident that his Honour took these matters into account in the exercise of his discretion as to the overall sentence to be imposed (ROS at 17) and in finding special circumstances (ROS at 22-23). The conditions upon which the applicant is to be released on parole are fashioned in accordance with the recommendations made by Dr Howard as they include compliance “with any psychiatric treatment as may be directed in relation to frontal lobe syndrome for appropriate management strategies” and reporting to “the Young Adult Diabetes Centre at either Westmead or the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital with the aim of modification of your diabetes for the management of your problems” (ROS at 25).  
     
      
    16 As special circumstances were found, the balance of the term of the sentence amounts to one half of the non-parole period.  
     
      
    17 The facts of the offence are serious. The applicant had met the victim, a 19-year-old English tourist, in the Darlington Hotel. He and a companion had been drinking with her for about twenty to thirty minutes when the victim went into the ladies toilet near where they were sitting. She was in a locked toilet cubicle when the applicant knocked on the door. When she opened the door, the applicant was standing in front of her and said words to the effect “I want you now, I want you tonight”. The victim said “No” and tried to get out of the toilet. The applicant started pulling at her skirt which came down and at her underwear. The victim was upset and screaming and the applicant told her to shut up or she would be killed. After pushing and hitting her, the applicant pushed her flat on the toilet seat. He then had penile intercourse with her without consent. 
     
      
    18 The sentencing Judge found that there was a degree of planning and clear premeditation as to what the applicant wanted to do. It was his intention to have a sexual encounter with a woman in the toilets. He and his companion had positioned themselves where women going to the toilets had to pass them by. He had carried out that plan notwithstanding the protestations of the victim whom he had only just met and with whom he had been engaged in conversations of a non-sexual nature. The offence was assessed by his Honour to be above the low range and just below the mid range level of criminality. The harm done to the victim by the crime was recognised by the sentencing Judge who further observed that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The squalid circumstances in which the events took place would also have been a physical and emotional affront to her as it would have been indeed to anybody in those circumstances having to endure that kind of experience having recently arrived in a foreign country” (ROS at 18).  
        
       
      
    19 At the time of the offending the applicant was 26 years old being the only child of a hard working Portuguese family who had emigrated to Australia. His Honour noted that “if there are any prospects of rehabilitation… it will be in the context of the family support and parental support available to [him]” (ROS at 10). He has a criminal history which was described by the sentencing Judge as “significant”. Although the applicant has no previous matters for sexual assault, he has a conviction for assault in November 1999 as well as convictions for matters involving the theft of vehicles and break and enter. He has been previously sentenced to terms of imprisonment. When the present offence was committed, he was on parole. His Honour observed that the applicant’s criminal involvement had “probably been exacerbated by his illicit drug use” (ROS at 11). He had a history of cannabis and then heroin usage, which commenced about the age of 18.  
     
      
    20 His Honour was required to balance rehabilitation with the other purposes of sentencing which are set out in s 3A of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 3A is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         “ 
        Purposes of sentencing  
        
       
       
        
        3A  
        The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows: 
         
          
          (a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
           
          (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
          
         
        
       
      
     (c) to protect the community from the offender, (d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
          
         
        
       
      
     (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.”  
          
         
        
       
      
     21 This was a serious crime. In a careful and well-reasoned judgment, the sentencing Judge balanced the competing purposes of sentencing appropriately. He gave sufficient weight to the evidence of Dr Howard and the applicant’s need for future treatment and rehabilitation. I am not persuaded that the non-parole period is excessive. In my opinion, the sentence passed cannot be properly stigmatised as manifestly excessive. For these reasons, I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HALL J: The offender has been referred to throughout the proceedings by the initials RHB, in consequence of an order I made pursuant to s.72 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Act 2005 on the first day of the trial on the application of senior counsel for the offender. That order was made for the reason recorded in the transcript in order to prevent disclosure of the name of two persons, given their ages, and the fact that it was anticipated they would be called to give evidence. I will refer to him throughout these remarks on sentence as “the offender”. He was charged by way of indictment that:- 
     
      
       
      (a) On 28 January 1993 at St Helen’s Park in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Caleb Paull. 
       
       
      (b) On 16 February 2004 at Peakhurst in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Isaac Schoer. 
       
      
    2 The offender pleaded not guilty to each charge and on 23 October 2007 the jury, whilst returning a verdict of not guilty of murder in respect of the first count, returned a verdict of guilty of manslaughter. In respect of the second count, the jury found the offender guilty of murder. 
     
      
    3 On 23 October 2007, the offender was stood over for sentence. 
     
      
    4 The offender was born on 7 November 1966 and is, accordingly, presently 41 years of age. He was aged 25 years as at the date of the first offence and was aged 37 years as at the date of the second offence. 
     
      
    5 The particular means by which the traumatic injury was inflicted on Caleb and Isaac were not revealed in the course of evidence at the trial. In both cases, each child had, at the relevant times, been in the care of the offender. The offender did not give evidence. There is, accordingly, no evidence from him which explains issues of his intent or motivation. I will, accordingly, in these remarks refer to the evidence including the medical evidence, which shed some light upon how the injuries were sustained. 
     
      
    6 In these remarks, I will refer to both crimes involving the two children, Caleb and Isaac. I will necessarily refer to both counts in respect of the death of each child. The offence of murder in the case of Isaac will necessarily require that I devote a somewhat greater period of time discussing the issue of his death. That is in no way to detract from the tragic manslaughter of Caleb. His death, like Isaac’s death, has left an unimaginable trail of grief and tragedy. The loss of life of both Caleb and Isaac is equally tragic. The legal consequences of each, however, raises different issues on sentence. 
     
      
    7 The two offences occurred some 10 years apart. The nature of the injuries sustained was remarkably similar. The jury’s verdicts, however, reflect its conclusion that the level of culpability between the two offences differed. In particular, the verdict on the first count concerning the death of Caleb shows that the offender may not be dealt with as having intended to kill Caleb or to do him really serious harm. 
     
      
       
      (1) Caleb Paull 
       
      
    8 The evidence established that the offender had known the mother of Caleb Paull, Tania Paull, for about six months before they were married on 4 December 1992. The offender and Tania Paull had two children together during the period of their marriage. Caleb was aged 14 months as at the date of his death on 28 January 1993. 
     
      
    9 On 26 January 1993, Australia Day, the child was alone with the offender for a time in the morning and again later in the afternoon. Tania Paull said in evidence that the child had been in his room. The offender had been somewhere in the house. She said he carried the child to her. Prior to that time, he had been well and eaten normally that day. She described his general health as “pretty good”. She said that when the child was brought to her it was apparent that Caleb needed medical attention. He was unconscious and was “limp”. When leaving for the hospital, the child was struck on the right side of the head when the offender swung open the car door. 
     
      
    10 Whatever the precise sequence of events, it is clear on the evidence which the jury must be taken to have accepted, that:- 
     
      
       
      (a) Caleb had, prior to the afternoon on 26 January 1993, been in good health. 
       
       
      (b) The accused, at some point on that afternoon when alone with the child, by some means inflicted traumatic injury to the child’s head. 
       
       
      (c) That the nature of the trauma involved sufficient force to give rise to a blunt force head injury as described in the medical evidence. 
       
      
    11 The Campbelltown Hospital records dated 26 January 1993 recorded that the child was found to be unwell around 4.00 pm, had a large vomit, went to sleep, woke at 5.30 pm, was reported as appearing to have a problem with vision, vomited several times, was noted as making “funny noises”, could barely open his eyes and was barely moving. Examination revealed signs of intra-cranial pressure and that there were spasms of his arms and legs. A CT scan revealed brain swelling and haemorrhage together with a fracture over the right occipital bone, described as a thick bone that does not fracture easily. 
     
      
    12 A post-mortem examination was carried out by Dr Nabila Haikal. Dr Haikal’s findings included:- 
     
      
       
      (a) Multiple bruising to the forehead, temple, scalp, left ear, right occipital scalp, left chin, right submandibular region. 
       
       
      (b) Small laceration to the labial frenulum. 
       
       
      (c) Bruising to the outside tissues to the skull. 
       
       
      (d) Diffuse swelling of the brain. 
       
       
      (e) Haemorrhages in the retinal areas of both eyes. 
       
      
    13 Dr Moran’s evidence was that the retinal injuries were indicative of a high force injury. Such injuries are known as angular acceleration forces which refer to movement of the brain around itself, pivoting on the brain stem. He said “shaking in small babies, in particular, shaking forces tend to cause rotational angular forces within the head” (t.454). 
     
      
    14 Dr Rodriguez, a neuropathologist, confirmed that the retinal haemorrhages throughout the layers of both eyes were associated with non-accidental injury. He observed on examination of the brain a recent haemorrhage underneath the dura. Lack of oxygen and blood supply had been associated with swelling of the brain. Dr Rodriguez identified the similarities in brain injuries and pathology and in the retinal haemorrhages in the cases of Caleb and Isaac. One of the notable facts of the trial was that there was very little dispute about the observations, diagnoses and conclusions as to internal traumatic (non-accidental) head injury made in both cases. 
     
      
       
      (2) Isaac Schoer 
       
      
    15 Isaac Schoer was born on 13 February 2002. He was the son of Karen Paull and Dean Schoer.  
     
      
    16 Isaac was born a healthy child. Approximately a year after Isaac’s birth, Karen Paull ceased living with Mr Schoer and lived with her parents. She said she and Mr Schoer remained friends and whenever he could Mr Schoer through mutual access arrangements would take the child. 
     
      
    17 Karen Paull, of course, had known the offender as her brother in law since the end of 1992. 
     
      
    18 Karen Paull said in evidence that the relationship between the offender and her sister broke up after Isaac was born, ie, after approximately 2001. After that separation, she continued to see the offender, he having left the previous matrimonial home at Menai, taking up residence in Peakhurst. 
     
      
    19 At some point, Karen Paull entered into an intimate relationship with the offender. 
     
      
    20 Karen Paull said that Isaac was a healthy child prior to him being taken to hospital. He would generally have a daytime sleep around lunch time. He would occasionally wake up at night. She stated that he was an active child and there was no particular occasion requiring the need to seek medical assistance for him. 
     
      
    21 Karen Paull said she and Mr Schoer remained very good friends. When asked whether the offender said anything about her visits to Mr Schoer, she stated “he would just make comments like how much he hated me going over there and spending time with Dean”. He made that statement on more than one occasion. Asked as to whether the offender ever made any comments about Isaac in connection with Mr Schoer, Karen Paull said that he would make comments like “I wish this child was mine so you wouldn’t have to go over and see Dean”. She said that that statement was made on more than one occasion. 
     
      
    22 Karen Paull gave evidence about the relationship between the offender and Isaac. She stated that initially when she commenced to go to the offender’s home in Peakhurst, Isaac “loved Ron and then it slowly deteriorated”. When asked to describe the deterioration she observed, she said that Isaac started to cry “any time I would drive or start to drive over to Peakhurst” and “he did not like getting picked up by Ron or getting held by him”. She observed bad behaviour in the child on several occasions. She said the offender commented upon it by saying something to the effect “I don’t understand why he’s changed towards me”. She said he made that statement because “I would ask him why”. 
     
      
    23 Karen Paull stated that when at her parents’ home, Isaac would wake and make “like baby noises”. When asked as to Isaac’s behaviour when he woke up when they were staying at the offender’s house, she said “he was very quiet. Wouldn’t make very much noise at all”. She confirmed that as at 13 February 2004, Isaac was “happy and healthy”. 
     
      
    24 At the time of Isaac’s death, the offender’s two children were aged approximately six and nine years. 
     
      
    25 Karen Paull picked up Isaac from Mr Schoer’s home the day after his birthday, 14 February 2004 and returned to the offender’s place at Peakhurst at about lunchtime. She said Isaac was perfectly well and she and was sitting with him in the loungeroom during the afternoon and that the offender was laying some carpet in the main bedroom of the house. At about 5.00 pm, she left to go to the shops. She said that, when she was in the loungeroom, Isaac was “playing with the boys” on the floor of the loungeroom. 
     
      
    26 Prior to leaving the house, she said she had a discussion with the offender as to whether she should take Isaac to the shops with her or whether they would all go or if she would just go by herself. She said she thought it would be best “if Isaac would play with his cousins”. When she left the house, Isaac was lying on a chair with a bottle of chocolate milk which she had prepared, that being his favourite and “because he hated me to go”. She knew that it was likely that he would start crying when she left. She said when this occurred other people were able to settle the child, but when asked as to whether the offender could settle him, she said “no”. 
     
      
    27 Karen Paull said she received the call from the offender just as she was driving away from the supermarket. He said, “hurry up and get back. Your son is unconscious. He’s blacked out”. She said she responded “What happened?” and the offender responded, “I don’t know what happened”. She said that at the time of his telephone call and during the earlier calls she could not hear the voice of any person other than the offender. In particular, she did not hear in the background either Isaac or the other boys during those calls. 
     
      
    28 Upon returning to the Peakhurst house, the offender was sitting on the lounge holding her son who “was lifeless”. Ms Paull said that the offender had said that the child was “throwing up and he went and washed him in the bath and was trying to calm him down and he said he didn’t know what happened”.  
     
      
    29 After the ambulance arrived, she heard the offender say to the ambulance officers that Isaac had “just blacked out”. Isaac was then taken to St George Hospital. 
     
      
    30 After they got to the hospital, she said the doctor said “do you realise this child has a lump on the back of his head?”. She had not previously noted it before. 
     
      
       
      Karen Paull’s relationship with the offender 
       
      
    31 Karen Paull said that about two months before Isaac passed away, she spoke to the offender about their relationship. She said “I told him we were going to revert back to being friends”. She said the offender didn’t like it and responded by saying, “I have no control over you”. She said his attitude changed towards her after she said that to him. She said “he was very quiet all the time and looking very grumpy all the time”. 
     
      
    32 During that two months, she was seeing Dean Schoer practically every week. She said that the relationship between her and Mr Schoer had become closer over time and that Mr Schoer had wanted to get back with her. She said “I was just thinking about it, but just wasn’t quite sure at that stage”. She said that she told the offender “I was thinking about it”. 
     
      
    33 Ms Paull said that, although Mr Schoer had visited the offender’s house before and after his motor accident in 2003, later there was a change, she stating “he wasn’t allowed to visit as much”, referring to the offender not allowing Mr Schoer to visit as frequently. 
     
      
    34 A month after Isaac’s death, she said she asked the offender why she hadn’t heard Isaac crying over the phone. He responded to the effect, “he was happy at that stage”. She agreed that she then said “I spoke to you twice on the phone and I didn’t hear Isaac at all”. The offender then said “I know, it doesn’t add up, but that’s what happened”. She said words to the effect “this is pointless”. The offender said, “I can’t tell you anything else, my only witness has gone. I am telling you the truth”. 
     
      
    35 Dr Mobbs, who was a neurosurgery registrar at St George Public Hospital tended to Isaac on the evening of 14 February 2004. When first examined, Isaac had a Glasgow coma score of four. A score of seven or less, by definition, means that a person is in coma. He noted the child had poor respiratory effort and a lower heart rate which he said was a fairly sinister feature and very abnormal for a child of that age, with a pulse rate of 50 adding “so he was in trouble”. 
     
      
    36 A CT scan was performed which revealed that the child had an acute subdural bleeding on the right hand side, the bleeding being so acute that there was a shift in the position of the mid-line of his brain within the skull case. Consequently, a decompressive craniotomy was performed to reduce the brain pressure. 
     
      
    37 Dr Mobbs explained that the pattern of injury was consistent with either a blunt force impact or with rotatory sudden jerky movements of the head and neck. He said he could not really say but believed that it was more the latter, rather than a singular one off blunt impact to the head – more from a combination of acceleration/deceleration injuries to the head. He said that the evidence of a chronic haematoma as well as an acute haematoma would lead him to believe that it occurred from more than one event. He, however, could not say when the chronic subdural haemorrhage had occurred, but it would have been within a short period such as weeks. 
     
      
    38 Dr Tzoumi, paediatrician, examined Isaac Shoer on 15 February 2004 in the intensive care unit. The clinical findings were right skull fracture, subdural haematoma, brain swelling, bruises to the skull and retinal haemorrhages. She said that the injuries were consistent “with a severe impact injury to the head, to the back on the right side of the head”. She said a severe impact would require “a lot of force to cause a fracture to the skull and the underlying haemorrhage and the surrounding brain injury that we saw in this child, that is the severe end, and at presentation he was very sick but it also indicates severity” (t.253). She said she had seen such injuries in motor vehicle accident cases which provides some idea of the severity involved – that there were large forces. She said that these sort of injuries are not seen from accidents where children tumble over from falls, but from falls from significant heights. 
     
      
    39 In reference to the eye haemorrhages, she said the mechanism required either what is called torsion or tearing. She stated that the backwards and forward motion of which she spoke affecting the brain could be due to shaking but it also could be due to any injury that involved that sort of movement of the head. Shaking was not the only thing that causes those type of haemorrhages. 
     
      
       
      Evidence: psychological and medical examinations 
       
      
    40 The offender did not give evidence at the hearing on sentence. There was tendered a psychological report on the offender by W John Taylor dated 27 June 2005 (Exhibit 1) a report from Dr William Lucas, consultant psychiatrist dated 16 July 2007 (Exhibit 3) and a report of Dr Dan G Milder, consultant neurologist, dated 25 May 2006 (Exhibit 2). 
     
      
    41 The employment history reveals that he initially obtained employment at the age of 17 years as an apprentice printer and thereafter he has worked primarily in the printing industry. 
     
      
    42 In terms of his health, he gave a history of having suffered epileptic fits since the age of 15 years. He still takes medication and had only had three or four seizures, the last seizure having occurred 10 year ago. 
     
      
    43 Mr Taylor stated that the offender had “stable personality functioning” and there was no indication of any personality or emotional disturbance. 
     
      
    44 In terms of assessed personality characteristics, there was no indication of any impairment with impulse control and no indication of any proneness to experiencing episodes of aggressive behaviour. There were no significant anti-social characteristics. 
     
      
    45 In terms of cognition, Mr Taylor stated that he did not suggest that he had any thought process problems and that he was capable of being introspective and insightful. 
     
      
    46 Mr Taylor did not record any conclusions indicating the existence of any psychological or cognitive problems. 
     
      
    47 Dr Lucas interviewed the offender on 11 April 2007. When asked about the history relevant to the charges, the offender told Dr Lucas that he could not remember anything specific about the day when Caleb Paull was taken to hospital. He gave a short history of Tania Paull giving Caleb to him and the next thing she coming in and saying that Caleb was not right and rushed to hospital. He referred to the incident of the child’s head being hit by the car door. 
     
      
    48 The offender gave a more detailed history in relation to the day Isaac Schoer was taken to hospital. In referring to the period after Karen Paull went to the shops later in the afternoon, he gave a history as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “[RHB] said Isaac was whinging as he always did when his mother was away. She had put him on the lounge where he was resting with a bottle while she when to the shop. [RHB] thinks that his sons [named] were playing with Isaac. 
        
       
       
        
        Isaac continued to be miserable and whining, so they took him to see a dog and rabbit in the yard, but this did not help. 
        
       
       
        
        [RHB] was sitting on the lounge and Isaac was standing in front of him. He became red in the face and angry and screamed for his mother. He went blue in the face, put his arms up and locked his fists and fell backwards. He did not strike the floor as [RHB] caught him. Isaac began to vomit. [RHB] took him to the bathroom, telephoned the ambulance and also Karen Paull who hurried back.” 
         (pp.5 to 6) 
        
       
      
    49 The offender told Dr Lucas that he understood from the medical evidence the severity of the injuries “but did not know how to explain them. However, he was there and saw what happened …” (p.6). 
     
      
    50 Dr Lucas concluded that there were no signs of psychiatric disorder evident and no indications of cognitive dysfunction. He did not relate his epilepsy to the events in question or describe himself as losing control at the relevant times. Dr Lucas concluded that there was no diagnosis of mood or psychotic disorder and no history suggesting personality disorder. 
     
      
       
      Prior criminal history 
       
      
    51 The offender’s criminal history (Exhibit A) records only two offences said to have occurred on 24 November 1994, the first being an improper use of telecommunications and the second an offence of making a false statement with intent to cause fear. There was no criminal history indicating any criminal violence associated with the offender. 
     
      
       
      Crown submissions: Count 1: manslaughter 
       
      
    52 The offender, having been found guilty of manslaughter on Count 1, the jury must be taken to have determined that he occasioned the death of Caleb by reason of his acts in having inflicted unlawful and dangerous acts upon a 14 month old child. The medical evidence permits the inference to be drawn that the force involved in occasioning blunt head injury to Caleb was a significant force or sufficient to cause rotational head injury or injury caused by impact. The offender’s motive is unknown. There was, presumably, an element of uncontrolled anger by the offender. 
     
      
    53 The mechanisms of injury were the same or similar to those that caused injury to Isaac. The jury’s finding of manslaughter, of course, necessarily means that the jury were not satisfied that the offender acted with the intent required for the offence of murder, namely, an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. Accordingly, the objective seriousness of the offence involving Caleb, though significant, of course, cannot and does not equate to the objective seriousness of the offence of murder. 
     
      
    54 It is also necessary in sentencing for two offences to have regard to matters of totality and considerations of concurrency and accumulation of sentences imposed. 
     
      
       
      Crown submissions: Count 2: murder 
       
      
    55 The Crown’s submission was that in relation to the jury’s verdict of guilty of murder in respect of Isaac, that the objective culpability associated with that defence is such as would cause me to consider the life sentence provisions of the legislation. 
     
      
    56 There are a number of provisions in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 relevant to sentencing on Count 2. I will refer to the Act in these remarks as the “Sentencing Procedure Act”. Section 61 provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “61.  
        Mandatory life sentences for certain offences 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Nothing in sub-section (1) affects s.21(1).” 
        
       
      
    57 The provisions of s.19A of the Crimes Act 1900 makes provision for the imposition of a term of imprisonment for life on a person who commits the crime of murder. However, s.19A(3) provides that nothing in that section effects the operation of s.21(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life). 
     
      
    58 It is sufficient also to note the general power to reduce penalties provided for in s.21 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 
     
      
    59 These provisions have been the subject of analysis by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Harris [2000] NSWCCA 469 and in Regina v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19. The provisions have been more recently considered by that Court in Knight v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 292. 
     
      
    60 In support of the submission made by the Crown in respect of the life sentence provisions, a number of matters were relied upon including the following:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The two homicides in this case were separated by 11 years. 
       
       
      (b) The offender had been spared prosecution in respect of the first homicide for some 11 years. 
       
       
      (c) The overwhelming vulnerability of the victims arises by virtue of their age, which it is said was on a par with the circumstances in the case of  
      Merritt 
       (supra). 
       
       
      (d) A distinguishing feature is that in  
      Merritt 
       the offender acted against his own children consequent upon feelings of failure he had towards his children, a circumstance which does not arise in the present case. 
       
       
      (e) There was a different familial relationship between the offender in the position of a step-father than in the case of a natural parent and his acts occasioning the death of the infants were said to be hostile acts  
      “both directly towards the immediate infant victims and also their families” 
      . 
       
       
      (f) There was an abuse of a position of trust or authority, an aggravating circumstance within s.21A(2)(k) of the  
      Sentencing Procedure Act 
      . The victims in the present case were always the children of other persons and the abuse of trust or authority goes beyond the natural parent situation of authority. 
       
       
      (g) The subjective circumstances of the case as not being favourable to him, it was contended, on a relative basis as judged against the case of  
      Merritt 
      . The offender is not a young person and there has been no plea of guilty in this case. There has been no feature of remorse or contrition exhibited whatsoever and no acknowledgment by the offender of any participation by him in the death of the children. 
       
       
      (h) The offender was not suffering from any psychiatric illness or disability or disturbance, a fact confirmed by the psychologists’ reports. 
       
       
      (i) In relation to the issue of future dangerousness, no assessment has been made. Accepting the jury’s verdicts, it was submitted that the fact is that the offender has killed two children, 11 years apart in circumstances whereby it would appear to have suited some purpose of his that has not been spelled out in the course of the present proceedings. Accordingly, it was submitted, the Court would exercise the utmost caution in relation to the topic of future dangerousness. It was submitted that the Court could not conclude that the offender was not an ongoing danger to the community and, in this respect, regard should be had to the 11 year gap between the two incidents, the circumstances in which the deaths arose and the fact that the Court has not been able to gain any understanding of the precise motivation in relation to the deaths of the children. 
       
       
      Submissions on behalf of the offender 
       
      
    61 Ms Davenport SC acknowledged that, having regard to the jury findings, she did not suggest that the moral culpability of the offender was not high and did not involve an abuse of trust. She acknowledged, of course, that the victims were amongst the most vulnerable in our society. 
     
      
    62 The fundamental submission made on behalf of the offender was that, in all the circumstances of the case, it was open to me to impose a determinate sentence, albeit a lengthy one, as an available sentencing option. In that respect, Ms Davenport submitted that a lengthy term of imprisonment would “overcome the problem of future dangerousness because whatever future dangerousness there may be, it is clear that [RHB], in terms of the offences he has been found guilty of, is not dangerous generally because he has not criminal history of violence”. 
     
      
    63 In support of the submission, reference was made to the evidence adduced at trial from Tania Paull and Karen Paull that the offender had not otherwise been a violent person. In particular, in dealing with his own children, he had not been physically violent with them, even to the extent of not having chastised them. The violence in respect of the two children who were the victims, it was submitted, constituted a very unusual pattern. 
     
      
    64 It was submitted for the offender that the Crown had the onus of establishing beyond reasonable doubt the matters referred to in s.61(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, that is, establishing the matters that make this case one in the worst category of offence lay with the Crown. 
     
      
    65 It was submitted:- 
     
      
       
      (a) That in  
      Harris 
       (supra) there was a high element of general dangerousness, being a case involving three disparate victims in their own homes and a high element of dangerousness to the community generally because of the circumstances of the killings. 
       
       
      (b) Since the relevant legislation was introduced, the pattern of sentencing indicates that life sentences are generally imposed in cases falling in particular categories such as contract killings, serial killings, random killings, where the victim is not known to the perpetrator and where there is dangerousness in terms of the behaviour of the offender. 
       
       
      (c) Although there was no blood relationship between the offender and Caleb, there was a family relationship, insofar as the child was a child of the household, less so in the case of Isaac. There was a relationship with Isaac, in that he was the cousin of his sons. It was also contended it was a family-type relationship, in the sense that Isaac visited on a regular basis, staying in his home. 
       
      
    66 The submission was that life sentences should fall outside the common pattern of sentencing for offences involving persons who are the natural parents or in a similar relationship. 
     
      
    67 Ms Davenport acknowledged that, whilst in one respect the gap of 11 years between the commission of the offences went against the offender, in another sense it did not, in that it showed that between the two incidents he had displayed no violence in any other aspect of his life either towards his own children or any other persons. 
     
      
    68 Ms Davenport acknowledged that it was unusual to have two offences committed with a long gap between them coming on for sentence together. It was necessary, she submitted, that they be looked at in a cumulative sense and in assessing moral culpability in terms of the offending conduct. 
     
      
    69 The reports tendered on the hearing, it was accepted, did not address issues of dangerousness by reason of the fact that the offender has not acknowledged his responsibility. It was also accepted that there was, accordingly, no evidence of contrition or remorse. 
     
      
    70 Ms Davenport referred to and relied upon remarks made by Barr J in Regina v Folbigg [2003] NSWSC 895 and the observations of this Court on appeal: Regina v Folbigg [2005] NSWCCA 23 at [174] as to unacceptable speculation in relation to the issue of dangerousness, where one is dealing with “distant future probabilities” and the risk of introducing an impermissible element of mere preventative detention for crimes which it is feared, in an incohate sense, the offender might commit in the distant future. 
     
      
    71 On the basis that a determinate sentence was imposed, Ms Davenport properly conceded that she would not be arguing against the application of the standard non-parole period of 20 years and acknowledging the reality that there would have to be some accumulation to some extent with the sentence to be imposed for the offence of manslaughter. It was emphasised that the offender is presently 41 years of age and that, on that basis, the question of parole would not arise until he was well into his 60s. Allowance should also be made, Ms Davenport argued, for the fact, in terms of dangerousness, that people do change as they mature. Reference was also made to the fact that it is highly unlikely that he would become involved in a situation of having a relationship with a woman who had a young child. 
     
      
    72 Finally, reference was made to the fact that the offender is in a special protection area of Parklea Prison and when transferred he will go into a non-association environment emphasising the severity associated with those conditions. 
     
      
    73 In relation to the onerous circumstances arising from strict protection conditions, Ms Davenport supplied an article entitled “Protective Custody and Hardship in Prison”. That article refers to the reasons for strict protection. 
     
      
       
      Relevant sentencing principles 
       
      
    74 I will firstly deal with some general principles in relation to the circumstances that may attract the maximum penalty of life imprisonment. I will then deal with issues of culpability, potential for dangerousness, prospects of rehabilitation and any other matters attracting leniency. 
     
      
    75 The following relevant principles apply in relation to the application of s.61(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The burden of proving that a case falls within s.61(1) of the Act rests on the Crown and the standard of proof of such proof is beyond reasonable doubt:  
      Merritt 
       (supra) at [35] and  
      Olbrich v The Queen 
       (1999) 199 CLR 270. 
       
       
      (b) The Court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person convicted of murder if it is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of such a sentence. It is accepted that punishment of that kind is reserved for cases which may properly be characterised as falling within the worst category of cases. 
       
       
      (c) The worst category of case of murder has been defined as including those cases where the particular features are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from the subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed):  
      Regina v Twala  
      (CCA, unreported, 4 November 1994, per Wood J (as he then was). The term  
      “heinousness” 
       has been defined and it is unnecessary here to reproduce what has been said in that respect, although I do, of course, have full regard to the meaning of that term in the present matter. 
       
       
      (d) Where there are multiple killings, that circumstance can be taken into account when assessing the level of the offender’s culpability in the application of s.61(1). 
       
       
      (e) The primary focus of the legislation is directed towards how extreme the offender’s culpability is:  
      Merritt 
       (supra) at [52]. Emphasis has been given to the importance of this factor and for the need for the Court to find features of very great heinousness along with the absence of any facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime. Accordingly, the assessment of culpability of an offender has to be based on the circumstances in which the offence was committed. 
       
       
      (f) The assessing court puts aside matters such as remorse, the prospects of rehabilitation and other subjective features. 
       
       
      (g) There is, in effect, a two-stage process. The Court must first determine whether on the objective facts the level of culpability is so extreme that it warrants the maximum penalty. If it is, the Court must determine whether the subjective evidence displaces the prima facie need for the maximum penalty to be imposed. 
       
       
      (h) Whilst the combined effect of the matters referred to in s.61(1) is the matter for attention in determining whether a life sentence is required, the absence of any finding of future dangerousness would not rule out an application of the section. The maximum penalty, in other words, is not reserved for those cases where the offender is likely to remain a continuing danger to society for the rest of his or her life or where there is no chance of rehabilitation. 
       
       
      (i) The maximum penalty may be appropriate where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met by such punishment. 
       
       
      (j) The mental state of the offender is always of considerable relevance in the assessment of the degree of objective culpability involved in the offence or offences. 
       
      
    76 In Merritt (supra), the Court stated that the murder by their natural father of three very young, vulnerable, innocent and entirely defenceless children, while they were asleep, involved the grossest breach of trust imaginable. It was stated that left unexplained or unmitigated by circumstances personal to the offender which might provide some reason for his resort to such extreme violence or where accompanied by deliberate cruelty and suffering to the children, such a case would properly fall within the ambit of s.61(1) and, as such, justify life sentences. 
     
      
    77 In Merritt (at [71]) it was observed that the offender’s decision to kill the children could only be categorised:- 
     
      
       
        
         “… as having been self-centred and extremely selfish. It means that the offences, which obviously involved willed and intentional acts of multiple murder, were gravely serious from an objective point of view.” 
        
       
      
    78 However, the Court in Merritt considered the objective criminality to be tempered by a number of circumstances. Those included:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The fact that the acts were clearly neither planned nor expected, but were spontaneous and impulsive. 
       
       
      (b) The fact that they did not occur against the background of abuse or violence and they were unaccompanied by any act or acts which involved the infliction of gratuitous cruelty. 
       
       
      (c) The fact that they were not carried out for the sexual gratification of the applicant. 
       
       
      Culpability 
       
      
    79 The assessment of the culpability of the offender must be directed to the circumstances surrounding or causally connected with the offence, leaving aside subjective matters (eg, remorse, of which there is no evidence in this case, rehabilitation prospects etc). This requires attention to be given to the blameworthiness of the person standing for sentence. 
     
      
    80 In the offender’s case, the objective facts include:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The fact that Isaac was a two year old child. 
       
       
      (b) The fact that Isaac was in the care of the offender at the time he inflicted injury, thereby constituting a gross breach of trust. 
       
       
      (c) The fact, as the medical evidence established, that a severe force was applied by the offender sufficient to occasion extreme forces occasioning closed head injuries. 
       
       
      (d) The fact that he had previously, by an unlawful and dangerous act, inflicted traumatic closed head injuries on Caleb and knew from his assault upon Caleb what the consequences had been and that such a result could again occur. 
       
      
    81 There are in this case in determining objective culpability no facts mitigating the seriousness of the murder of Isaac. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
      
    82 In relation to the murder of Isaac Schoer, the matter at the forefront of the assessment in relation to the offender’s culpability is, of course, the fact that the victim, being a two year old child left in his custody, was, at such a young age, so vulnerable and defenceless. 
     
      
    83 In the assessment of culpability, is the fact that the offender has not explained to police or to this Court the circumstances that led to his infliction of blunt head injury to the child. There is evidence of surrounding circumstances in which that offence occurred leading up to the time when Isaac’s mother left to go shopping. Karen Paull’s evidence indicated that, at least up to approximately 5.00 pm on that day, the home environment was nothing other than completely normal. She had been in the company of the children in the loungeroom whilst they played and the offender had busied himself to the carpet-laying task. There was no evidence of any incident having arisen which provoked anger or aggression in the offender. Insofar as there is any information, it is limited to the recorded history to which I have already referred recorded in the notes of the hospital (see paragraph [48] above) which refer to the offender taking hold of Isaac once he commenced to cry. 
     
      
    84 However, the recorded medical history is not evidence in these proceedings. The relevance of the apparently normal events throughout the afternoon may reflect upon whether or not the offence was part of a planned activity, a matter to be taken into account in accordance with s.21A(2)(n) of the Sentencing Procedure Act and generally in the assessment of the offender’s culpability. The Crown did not submit that it was a planned offence. 
     
      
    85 The events of the afternoon can, at best, only be indirect evidence in support of the proposition that there was no evident premeditation prior to the immediate events preceding the receipt of infliction of injury. As was observed in Regina v O’Connell [2004] NSWSC 1120 by Davidson AJ at [70], who was dealing with a submission that there was no evidence that the offence in that case was premeditated, observed much, of course, depends upon what is meant by that term. His Honour there stated that it does not necessarily involve long and careful planning. 
     
      
    86 In dealing with the question of the offender’s intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm to Isaac inherent in the jury’s finding, plainly at some stage he formed the intent to do one or the other. The absence of evidence was to motive does not enable one to discern what was the offender’s precise intent. Whether during the course of that afternoon or closer to the point of infliction of the injury is unknown, although it may well have been that he formed the intent at some stage later on the day in question. 
     
      
    87 I do not leave out of account the evidence given by Karen Paull to the effect that, some two months before, the offender exhibited signs of displeasure at her suggestion the relationship should revert to a non-intimate one and at her practice of taking the child on a regular basis to Mr Schoer. Her evidence also provided some context insofar as his statements to her indicated he was not happy for her to visit Mr Schoer and that he wished Isaac had been his child so that ongoing contact between the child and his father would be a reality. The evidence, however, in this respect, does not permit a finding to be made to the requisite standard that there was any sense of long brooding or resentment that itself was causally related to the infliction of injury upon Isaac Schoer. 
     
      
    88 The evidence enables a conclusion to be drawn, at least to the extent that the offender’s act in inflicting injury manifest uncontrolled aggression. But what psychological dynamic in the offender as relationship to any external factor whether related to Isaac or Isaac’s mother, has not been established on the evidence. 
     
      
    89 Whether the jury’s conclusion be that the offender intended to kill or intended to cause grievous bodily harm to Isaac when the offence occurred, involving a two year old as it did, the intent to do either may be considered as one involving an equally high level of culpability. 
     
      
    90 I have concluded that, whilst the level of culpability of the offender in relation to the offence of murder is high, I do not consider that, having examined the circumstances of the offence on Count 2 at length, a sentence of imprisonment for life should be imposed under s.61(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 
     
      
    91 A worst case may be seen illustrated by the facts in Harris (supra). The facts of that case involving three counts of murder involved killings involved victims who were aged, disadvantaged or physically slight and easy prey, the killing of one involved a betrayal of trust, all occurred within the space of a month, each involved considerable callousness. The second and third killings were particularly heinous, callous and reprehensible. The objective seriousness of all the offences and the culpability of the offender in Harris was classed as particularly extreme. 
     
      
    92 In the assessment in the present case, I have throughout kept at the forefront the fact that the two victims were children of tender age. It is in the nature of mankind that the vulnerable in our society are deserving of and do receive protection. That fact is reflected in s.21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act that classes as an aggravating factor offences against the “very young” and the “very old”. Persons within those classes are vulnerable and the fact that both Caleb and Isaac were so young and, therefore, so vulnerable is a matter to which I have had regard, along with the other matters to which I have referred in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence of manslaughter, the offence of murder and determining the structure of those sentences having regard to the principles of totality and accumulation. 
     
      
    93 As earlier noted, imprisonment for life is reserved for cases tha may properly be described as a worst category. For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the gradations which the law recognises, I observe that premeditated murders committed simply for financial gain or carried out with great cruelty or which involve, not one, but multiple murders are the type of case or cases that may fall within the worst category. The offence in this case on Count 2 did not, as I have stated, on my assessment, fall into that particular category and is to be judged against the appropriate, if not, imprecise, standards of criminality. 
     
      
    94 The Victim Impact Statement of Tania Paull dated 20 November 2007, the statement of Karen Paull dated 27 November 2007 and the statement of Dean Schoer dated 30 November 2007 were read to the Court. I have read those statements as well as the statement of Colleen Schoer dated 20 November 2007. 
     
      
    95 In doing so, I have had regard to the provisions of the Sentencing Procedure Act and the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 96; Regina v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 at [43] and Regina v King [2004] NSWCCA 444 at [171]. In accordance with established principle, I must approach my sentencing task objectively and dispassionately. However, in saying that, I do not in any way leave out of account that the dominating feature of any conviction for manslaughter and for murder is that the person convicted has caused the death of another human being with the sad and often traumatic consequences that commonly flow from such an event. Each of the statements to which I have referred express in clear and dignified terms the pain and trauma that has resulted from the death of Caleb Paull and Isaac Schoer.  
     
      
       
      Potential for dangerousness 
       
      
    96 There is no psychiatric evidence placed before me which would assist with an assessment of the offender’s potential for dangerousness in the future. That, of course, is a matter of relevance in relation to the need to have regard to the protection of the community: Regina v Veen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. This is a case in which it is proper to look to the circumstances of the offences, so far as they throw light on the offender’s dangerousness. I have previously referred to and I accept Ms Davenport’s submissions in this regard to the effect that the offender’s dangerousness is to be considered in the more confined or restricted context to which she referred rather than dangerousness in the general sense of the term. 
     
      
       
      Standard non-parole period 
       
      
    97 In respect of the offence of murder committed on or after 1 February 2003, Division 1A of Part 4 of the Sentencing Procedure Act prescribes that the standard non-parole period is, as specified in the Table to that Division, a period of 20 years. The offence of murder having been committed in this case after 1 February 2003, s.51A of the Division applies to this case. That period of 20 years is stated to represent the non-parole period for an offence that falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for such offences. Whether a longer or shorter period than that is set depends upon the application of matters in s.21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act which identify aggravating and mitigating circumstances. 
     
      
    98 The standard non-parole period provisions are to be considered in light of other provisions in the Act including s.3A which stated the multiplicity of purposes of sentencing:- 
     
      
       
        
        “s.3A The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
           
           
          (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from commiting similar offences, 
           
           
          (c) to protect the community from the offender, 
           
           
          (d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
           
           
          (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
           
           
          (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
           
           
          (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    99 The standard non-parole period of 20 years provides a reference point or benchmark within the sentencing spectrum for the offence of murder and in itself employs a further reference point, being a point in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the offence. 
     
      
    100 The application of the standard non-parole period was discussed by this Court in Regina v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, in particular at 183-193. 
     
      
    101 I have had regard to all the circumstances to which I have referred in determining whether a lesser or greater non-parole period should be applied to this case. I have concluded that the standard non-parole period to which I have referred should be applied. 
     
      
    102 In determining whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period, I have had regard to the objective seriousness of the offence in the light of the facts which relate directly to its commission and to the circumstances of aggravation and of mitigation as listed in s.21A(2) and (3). In relation to the objective circumstances, it is apparent that the standard non-parole period of 20 years does apply to this case. The factors to be taken into account in that respect include the fact that the victim of the offence was a very young child who was vulnerable and that the offender abused his position of trust and authority in relation to the victim. They also include the factual circumstances surrounding the offence and the other matters to which I have referred including the issue of premeditation and the subjective factors, as earlier discussed. 
     
      
    103 In terms of the subjective circumstances, I have had regard to the fact that the offender did not have a significant criminal history prior to the first offence, that he did not have a history of violence before or between the first and second offences and that he had remained in employment since leaving school. There is, as I have previously stated, no factor identified in the psychological reports or the medical report which identifies any disability or disadvantage bearing upon the assessment of his conduct in relation to the offences. 
     
      
    104 In my opinion, in respect of the murder of Isaac Schoer, I consider an overall sentence entailing a head sentence of 30 years and a non-parole of 20 years to be indicated. This sentence, in respect of an offence occurring approximately 11 years after the first, should be wholly accumulated upon the non-parole period of four years and six months to be imposed in respect of the offence of manslaughter of Caleb Paull. 
     
      
    105 I propose to impose sentences which will produce an effective head sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment and a non-parole period of 24 years and six months. 
     
      
    106 The non-parole period proposed in respect of the offence of murder is 80% of the proposed head sentence rather than the statutory norm of 66%. I consider that a somewhat longer than normal non-parole period is justified in order to reflect the reasonable requirements overall of the case having, in particular, regard to the matters bearing upon the offender’s culpability including the finding made in respect of the limited future dangerousness of the offender referred to earlier. I do not consider that this is a case for a finding of special circumstances and no such finding was sought. 
     
      
    107 In respect of the offence of manslaughter of Caleb Paull, I sentence you to a non-parole period of four years and six months commencing on 6 May 2005 and to expire on 5 November 2009 with a balance of term of one year and six months to expire on 5 May 2011. 
     
      
    108 In respect of the offence of murder of Isaac Schoer, I sentence you to a non-parole period of 20 years to commence on 6 November 2009 and to expire on 5 November 2029 with a balance of term of 10 years to expire on 5 November 2039.

    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    2 HALL J: The applicant, by way of notice of application for leave to appeal, filed on 19 July 2007 relies upon six grounds in respect of the sentence imposed upon him by the Lismore District Court (His Honour Judge Freeman) on 23 March 2007. 
     
      
    3 On 22 August 2006 before the Lismore Local Court, the applicant entered pleas of guilty to:- 
     
      
       
      • one count of supply prohibited drug (151.7 grams cannabis leaf) contrary to s.25(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985  
      (carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and/or 2,000 penalty units); and 
       
       
      • one count of supply prohibited drug (194 grams cannabis resin) contrary to s.25(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985  
      (carrying a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2,000 penalty units); and 
       
       
      • one count of cultivate prohibited plant (40 cannabis plants) contrary to s.23(1)(a) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985  
      (carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2,000 penalty units). 
       
      
    4 On 13 December 2006, the applicant was indicted on the same counts before his Freeman DCJ and he pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    5 On 23 March 2007, Freeman DCJ imposed the following sentences:- 
     
      
       
        
        Counts 1 and 3:  
        Fixed term of 12 months to date from 23 March 2007 and to expire on 22 March 2008. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2:  
        Imprisonment for two years and three months to date from 23 March 2007 and to expire on 22 June 2009. A non-parole period was fixed of one year and three months to date from 23 March 2007 and to expire on 22 June 2008. 
        
       
      
    6 The total effective sentence, accordingly, was two years and three months with a non-parole period of one year and three months to date from 23 March 2007. 
     
      
    7 In his remarks on sentence, his Honour set out the facts. The essential matters referred to were as follows:- 
     
      
       
      • Between 18 January and 20 February 2006, a joint investigation was conducted by police in the Northern Rivers area. Police formed a strike force to investigate the cultivation and distribution of cannabis by one Geoffrey Knight and others, including the applicant. 
       
       
      • Telecommunication services utilised by Knight were lawfully intercepted. Conversations between Knight and the applicant were recorded. 
       
       
      • The conversations between Knight and others, according to a statement of agreed facts, were concerned with the distribution of cannabis. The conversations included discussions about the type, quality, weight and price. The sentencing judge, however, correctly observed that conversations with the applicant were not so obviously related to the supply of cannabis. 
       
       
      • On 20 February 2006, police executed a search warrant at the premises occupied by the applicant. They located a hydroponic system in the back room of the premises. There were 40 cannabis plants ranging in height from 15 centimetres to 20 centimetres. The system included lamps, nutrients and an exhaust system. 
       
       
      • In a bedroom at the premises, police located the 194 grams of cannabis resin together with a couple of grams of cannabis seeds. 
       
       
      • In the laundry/bathroom area, a further supply of hydroponic nutrients was discovered. In a cubbyhouse there was also found the 1.55 grams of dried cannabis in a 20 litre blue plastic drum and two white foam boxes. Inside the boxes a clear plastic bag was located containing a quantity of dried cannabis and another bag, which was half full of cannabis. Inside the blue plastic drum, police located a re-sealable plastic sandwich bag full of dried cannabis and a white shopping bag containing an amount of dried cannabis. 
       
       
      • In a vehicle owned by the applicant, police located a quantity of hydroponic nutrients, exhaust, pots and irrigation hosing. 
       
       
      • The applicant attended at Lismore Police Station on Wednesday 22 February 2006 and was placed under arrest. He made a full admission to the cultivation and possession of cannabis plants for  
      “personal use” 
      . 
       
       
      • In relation to the cannabis resin and leaf, he made full admissions to the possession of such items for  
      “personal use” 
      . 
       
      
    8 In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge made a number of observations including the following:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The answers given by the applicant in the recorded interview were  
      “transparently false” 
      . He re-entered the witness box during the sentencing hearing and conceded that some of his answers had been false. 
       
       
      (b) The sentencing judge, however, stated that evidence given before him contained falsehoods. His Honour stated:- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “… I just do not believe that his connection with Knight was limited to the supply, on one occasion of two ounces of cannabis and, indeed, he … finally (conceded) that at least half of it was going on to some unknown person, to be supplied by Knight, so that even on his own admissions, grudgingly though they were, this offender was taking part in the supply to ‘others’, (plural) of cannabis.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (c) The facts indicated that the applicant was cultivating cannabis in a fairly sophisticated way. Although the equipment may not have been sophisticated, nonetheless, the sentencing judge found  
      “… this was a fairly sophisticated arrangement, the quantity was not insignificant, he is deemed guilty of supply, not only of the leaf itself, but of the resin, which carries the higher penalty, and, of course, the cultivation itself is a separate offence” 
       (remarks on sentence, p.6). 
       
       
      (d) The sentencing judge then considered two matters which the Crown had argued were serious aggravating factors. The first related to the prior record of the applicant of cultivation. The sentencing judge noted that in 1991 the applicant was charged and pleaded guilty to one count of cultivation of cannabis. It appeared that there were some 40 plants, of which only 21 could be identified as cannabis because they were the only ones that had grown sufficiently to meet the botanical description of the plant. Mr Boulten SC, who appeared for the applicant, observed that number was lower than the indictable quantity. The sentencing judge stated that it did not seem to him to be a very serious example of cultivation  
      “… but nonetheless it is significant in terms of this offender’s history …” 
       (remarks of sentence, p.7). 
       
       
      (e) The sentencing judge referred to the applicant’s history of having a 20 year addiction to cannabis, or at least, a very heavy habit and he observed  
      “… it is clear that he has begun this cultivation, not only for his own purposes, but in a commercial way for the purposes of supplying it to Knight and others” 
       (remarks on sentence, p.7). 
       
      
    9 On the question of the applicant’s prior criminal record as an aggravating factor, the sentencing judge stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… the fact that he had been caught before, however small, however long ago, is a matter of considerable concern and serious aggravation …”  
         (remarks on sentence, p.7) 
        
       
      
    10 The second aggravating element contended for by the Crown was that the offences were said to be part of an organised criminal activity. In that respect, reliance was placed upon the provisions of s.21A(1)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    11 The sentencing judge stated that clearly the applicant was acting in concert with Knight, providing him with cannabis. He found that “it was an organised criminal activity …”. 
     
      
    12 The sentencing judge then considered mitigating factors. He proceeded upon the basis that the applicant was entitled to a 25% discount for his early plea. In terms of the subjective case, the sentencing judge observed that he was, at the time of sentence, 45 years of age, had been mainly employed throughout his working life and that he had, except for the offences, been a “… reasonably solid contributor to the society …”. 
     
      
    13 The sentencing judge also took into account a number of references, a letter of commendation from the police for assisting in what were described as “difficult circumstances” some years ago. The sentencing judge also had regard to the pre-sentence report and made a finding of special circumstances in his favour. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
       
      (a) Ground 1: His Honour erred by treating the applicant’s prior conviction for cultivating cannabis as a matter of serious aggravation 
       
      
    14 As the Crown observed in its submissions, s.21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 should be read according to the common law principle, namely, that proportionality requires that the upper limit of a sentence be set by the objective circumstances: Regina v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 76; Regina v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 at [24] and Regina v McNaughton [2006] 163 A Crim R 381 at [12], [24]. 
     
      
    15 In Regina v Hamid [2006] 164 A Crim R 179 at [145], Johnson J (Hunt AJA and Latham J agreeing) said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The principle of proportionality requires the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence to be set by the objective circumstances of the offence, which circumstances do not encompass prior convictions:  
        Regina v McNaughton 
         … at [24]-[25]. However, the respondent’s prior convictions are pertinent to an assessment as to where, within the boundary set by the objective circumstances, a sentence should lie by reference to his attitude of disobedience towards the law and increased weight to be given to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of society:  
        Regina v McNaughton 
         at [26].” 
        
       
      
    16 The Crown acknowledged that the sentencing judge appears to have accepted the submission made by the Crown that the previous conviction was a matter of aggravation. Expressed in those terms, the Crown accepts that that was an error. 
     
      
    17 It, however, submitted that on the basis that this Court came to the view that the sentencing judge took the previous record of the applicant into account in an impermissible way, then in the circumstances, no lesser sentence was warranted. 
     
      
    18 In the written submissions on behalf of the applicant, it was contended that the applicant’s conviction in 1991, which resulted in a fine of $1,500 reflected both the fact that the matter was clearly at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness as well as the applicant’s very favourable subjective circumstances. It did not justify a conclusion that the applicant’s criminal record demonstrated that the commission of the offences here in question constituted a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law or provide a proper basis for the sentencing judge to treat the 1991 cultivation conviction as “a matter of considerable concern and serious aggravation” of the instant offences. It was further submitted for the applicant that his Honour failed to take into account evidence suggesting that the applicant was no longer smoking cannabis at the time of sentence and had taken positive steps to address his cannabis addiction. 
     
      
    19 In stating, as the sentencing judge did, “Clearly, the fact that he had been caught before, however small, however long ago, is a matter of considerable concern and serious aggravation”, Mr Boulten SC submitted his Honour erred and that it was likely that this aspect impacted on the length of each sentence. However, the Crown submitted, whether or not there was error in this respect, the question was whether or not any lesser sentence was warranted. I will return to that question following consideration of the remaining grounds relied upon. 
     
      
       
      (b) Ground 2: His Honour erred by regarding each of the offences as having been aggravated because they were part of an organised criminal activity 
       
      
    20 The Crown has submitted that, on findings made by the sentencing judge, he was entitled to find that the conduct of the applicant went beyond the inherent features of the offence. It submitted that no error was made in finding that the applicant’s conduct was part of a planned or organised criminal activity. 
     
      
    21 It was contended for the applicant that the question raised by Ground 2 was whether the agreed facts merely went to show that the offences were not unplanned or impulsive as distinct from regarding it as an additional feature of aggravation. 
     
      
    22 In the written submissions on behalf of the applicant, Mr Boulten conceded that it was open to the sentencing judge to:- 
     
      
       
      • Use the evidence of the applicant’s supply of cannabis to Knight to assist in characterising his motivation and intention in each of the offences. 
       
       
      • The supply to Knight made available an inference that the plants were being cultivated, not just for the applicant’s personal use, but also to supply Knight and, perhaps, others. 
       
       
      • That it was open to conclude that the cannabis leaf and resin were being held by the applicant, not just for his own use, but for supply to others. 
       
      
    23 Mr Boulten, however, submitted that it did not follow that the offences here in question were aggravated on the basis they were an organised criminal activity. 
     
      
    24 Whilst it was accepted in the applicant’s submissions that the cultivation charge was a relatively serious one, it was contended that the facts revealed that the deemed supply of the cannabis leaf and the home made cannabis resin were not particularly well planned or organised. The telephone conversations simply confirmed a likely supply. None of the offences, it was submitted, would permit a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the degree of organisation or planning exceeded what would ordinarily be expected of an offence of that kind, that is, “… the degree of planning that would be inherent in the possession of an indictable quantity of cannabis for the purpose of supply or the cultivation of 40 plants”. It was submitted that his Honour’s conclusion that the process was an organised criminal activity is an error of the kind identified by Simpson J (with whom Hoeben J agreed) in Regina v Yildiz (2006) 160 A Crim R 218 at [39]. See also Adams J in Yildiz at [87]. For the reasons set out below, I agree that the sentencing judge was in error in reaching that conclusion. 
     
      
    25 The provisions of s.21A(2)(n) have been the subject of consideration on a number of occasions. The following propositions may be derived from relevant decisions:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The wording of the provision conveys more than simply that the offence was planned:  
      Fahs v Regina 
       [2007] NSWCCA 26 per Howie J at [12] (Simpson and Buddin JJ agreeing). His Honour further observed:- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “… The fact that there was a ‘level of planning in the offences’ as found by the judge does not necessarily give rise to the aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(n). In  
          Wickham 
           [2004] NSWCCA 193, the Court stressed the importance of making findings under s.21A in accordance with the words of the provision ...” 
            
          
         
        
       
       
      (b) In a case where an offender has been charged with multiple drug trafficking offences, a conclusion may be drawn that it is part of a planned or organised criminal activity. In  
      Fahs 
       (supra), Howie J observed:- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “… In this case, it would have been open to the judge to find that such a factor existed in respect of each of the offences because it was clear that the applicant was committing the crimes as part of a drug trafficking organisation capable of supplying large amounts of different types of drugs to order.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (c) The expression  
      “organised criminal activity” 
       may embrace the activities of several people or it may involve activity carried out by one person. In  
      NCR Australia v Credit Connection 
       [2005] NSWSC 1118, Campbell J observed at [72]:- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “In deciding whether the aggravating factor in para (n) is present, there is first a question of construction about what is meant by ‘organised criminal activity’. In one sense, ‘organised criminal activity’ involves the activities of several people that are planned or co-ordinated to carry out the crime. That is the sense involved in media discussion about whether organised crime is on the increase. In another sense, however, it can include activity that is carried out by just one person, concerning which that person engages in planning or preparation.” 
            
          
         
        
       
       
        
        His Honour also observed:- 
         
          
          “… as a matter of ordinary English, to think that ‘planned criminal activity’ has any necessary element in it of there being more than one person involved … For these reasons, I conclude that the factor in para (n) can be present if there is planned organised criminal activity engaged in by just one person.”  
          (at [74] and [75]). 
          
         
        
       
       
      (d) Offences committed over a period of time may involve sufficient repetition and system to lead to the conclusion that they were organised within the meaning of paragraph (n):

      (e) In determining whether the facts give rise to “planning” as an aggravating factor, it is necessary to consider and refer to both the evidence that may affirm, and the evidence that may negative the drawing of such a conclusion. This Court in  
      Regina v Reynolds  
      [2004] NSWCCA 51, in determining on the facts of that case that evidence of planning was very limited but that it did exist and was of greater significance than that considered by the sentencing judge, observed at [39]:- 
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “It may be that, had he considered the evidence in detail, his Honour would nevertheless have reached a factual finding similar to that which he did. The error lies in his failing to make reference to evidence pointing to a contrary conclusion. In particular, the list of businesses was, in my view, quite strong evidence of a degree of planning. The absence of a disguise is only one factor pointing in the other direction, or pointing to poor, rather than no, planning.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (f) Planning that is  
      “…somewhat haphazard, clumsy in many respects and bound to fail…” 
       may nevertheless be sufficient so as to enliven the application of s.21A(2)(n):

      Findings made by the sentencing judge 
       
      
    26 His Honour found that various answers given by the applicant in a recorded interview with police with regard to conversations between himself and Knight, were false, and also rejected the applicant’s evidence in various respects. His Honour stated that:-  
     
      
       
        
        “… the answers given by the offender in his recorded interview and indeed in evidence are not acceptable to me. I do not believe him, which has bearing upon the sentence in that the Crown argues there is an aggravating factor present – I find that there is in the sense of this being an organised criminal activity – and I will return to that later.” 
         (Remarks on Sentence, pp.2-3).  
        
       
      
    27 His Honour stated that he did not believe that the applicant’s connection with Knight was limited to supply, on one occasion of two ounces of cannabis. His Honour observed that the applicant in his evidence “… seemed to depart even from his initial stance that [the cannabis supplied] was for Knight’s own use only, finally conceding that at least half of it was going on to some unknown person, to be supplied by Knight, so that even on his own admissions, grudging though they were, this offender was taking part in the supply to “others”, (plural), of cannabis”. (Remarks on Sentence, p.5).28 His Honour found that, “… it is clear that [the applicant] has begun this cultivation, not only for his own purposes, but in a commercial way for the purpose of supplying it to Knight and others” (Remarks on Sentence, p.7).29 His Honour further found that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is agreed, in the statement of facts, that Knight was a supplier. Clearly, [the applicant] was acting in concert with Knight, providing him with cannabis. I find that it was an organised criminal activity, and that is a second serious aggravating element”. 
         (Remarks on Sentence, p.7). 
        
       
      
    30 Mr Boulten, in his detailed and helpful submissions, conceded, as noted above, that the factual findings enabled the sentencing judge to conclude that the cannabis leaf and resin were being held, not only for personal use, but also to supply Knight and perhaps others. However, as he observed, in my view correctly, on the facts established in evidence, it did not follow that the offences were part of an organised criminal activity. 
     
      
    31 The telephone intercept material (in respect of 12 February 2006) established that the applicant was prepared to supply a quantity of cannabis to Knight, one for his use and one for his “old mate”. The evidence did not, in my opinion, establish any additional supply or a more extensive or ongoing supply arrangement between the applicant and Knight or anyone else. He was not charged with any separate offence of supply of cannabis to Knight. 
     
      
    32 Mr Boulten accepted that the cultivation offence was relatively serious (40 cannabis plants), though they were quite small plants. The fact remains that the evidence conveys a picture of a fairly rudimentary situation and certainly not a well-planned or sophisticated operation. This conclusion is not, in my opinion, in conflict with the telephone intercept material, which, apart from one and possibly two calls, were inconclusive. 
     
      
    33 The evidence did not establish the indicia of organised criminal activity such as:- 
     
      
       
      • The fact, beyond the supply to Knight on the one occasion referred to above, of a multiplicity of actual supplies by the applicant of prohibited drugs as in  
      Fahs 
       (supra) (four supplies). 
       
       
      • The supply offences or the cultivation offence as being constituent parts of an established or an ongoing wholesale drug business or other organisation established for the purpose of supplying drugs. 
       
       
      • An organised criminal activity based on the activities of a number of people participating in the supply of prohibited drugs. 
       
      
    34 In oral submissions, Mr Boulten stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The deemed supply of cannabis leaf was fairly standard, and I must say deemed supply of one and a half kilograms of leaf there is nothing attendant about the objective facts of his possession of that cannabis for the purposes of supply which dictate that it be described as being part of a planned and organised criminal activity. Likewise his possession of the home made resin in the sock in the drawer in the bedroom does not, in my submission, allow the conclusion that his possession of it albeit for the purposes of supply was part of a planned and/or organised criminal activity.  
        
       
       
        
        Likewise the growing of the cannabis was not such as to lead to such a conclusion even though it did involve, as it were, a hydroponic system that involved the use of lights. There was nothing special about the way that this small system in the back bedroom was being utilised to describe it in a way which justifies the determination that this was part of a planned and organised criminal activity. There were a number of lamps used, the plants were clearly fertilised, but so too you might think would all marijuana plantations be fertilised.  
        
       
       
        
        It would be almost unthinkable that people would just throw the seeds in the ground and watch them grow. You have to water them, and if you grow them inside you need to put a light on them. We submit that for instance the absence of automatic watering systems, and air-conditioning systems that are often seen in hydroponic operations allows the conclusion that this was a fairly standard small scale hydroponic crop which did not allow for the conclusion his Honour drew that it was a part of a planned and organised criminal activity.”  
        
       
      
    35 It was argued on behalf of the applicant that, against the notion that the offences were part of an organised criminal activity, were the fact that:- 
     
      
       
      • The applicant was not a well-established commercial dealer of cannabis. 
       
       
      • The telephone intercept evidence related to the one supply of cannabis to Knight. 
       
       
      • None of the usual indicia of supply were located by police. 
       
       
      • The police did not find  
      “the usual trappings” 
       of a drug dealer. 
       
      
    36 I have examined the transcript of the intercepted telephone calls between the applicant and Knight in the period 29 January 2006 and 12 February 2006. The applicant admitted in evidence that at least some of these calls related to giving Knight cannabis (his evidence was that they related to one supply of two ounces of cannabis). He said that he had obtained timber supplies from Knight (who operated a mill for several years) in relation to his contract fencing business. He said in the ERISP that he had known Knight for approximately 30 years. He claimed that he gave the two ounces to Knight, one for Knight himself and one for a person referred to on the taped conversation only as “old mate”. In return, he said he received an allowance on the price of timber next obtained from Knight.  
     
      
    37 The intercepted telephone conversations between the applicant and Knight do not record any discussion about type, quality or price of cannabis and they arguably relate to the one occasion involving the abovementioned supply of cannabis to Knight. They do not support a conclusion that the applicant and Knight were discussing the subject of ongoing drug supply or any other transaction than the one to which I have referred. 
     
      
    38 The offence of supply prohibited drug (Count 2) was an offence that plainly required and involved a degree of planning. 
     
      
    39 The sentencing judge, however, was enjoined by s.21A(2) against taking into account any aggravating feature if it is an element of the offence charged. That injunction has been extended to circumstances that are “an inherent characteristic of the offence charged”: Yildiz (supra) at [37] per Simpson J. 
     
      
    40 However, this principle, of course, does not mean that the degree to which the “inherent characteristic” exists in relation to a particular offence may not, where it exceeds the norm, be taken into account as an aggravating factor: Yildiz (supra) at [37] per Simpson J. 
     
      
    41 The sentencing judge did not, with respect, in his conclusion, make appropriate allowance for the fact that the supply and cultivation offences necessarily involved a degree of planning. I would apply the same description of planning as occurred in this case to that utilised by Hoeben J in Readburn v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 60 (Sully and Bell JJ agreeing), namely, that the evidence revealed a “low level of planning”. 
     
      
    42 I have concluded that the sentencing judge erred in concluding that the offences were part of an organised criminal activity. The wording of s.21A(2)(n) conveys more than simply that the offence was planned: Fahs (supra) per Howie J at [21]. As Howie J there observed, the fact that there was a level of planning in the offences does not necessarily give rise to an aggravating factor in terms of s.21A(2)(n). 
     
      
       
      (c) Ground 3: His Honour erred by failing to have regard to the likely quality of the cannabis leaf and resin 
       
      
    43 The evidence before the sentencing judge included a certificate provide by the senior analyst from the Division of Analytical Laboratories, Ms Susan Laird. The factual matters raised in the submissions for the applicant are:- 
     
      
       
      • That of the approximately 1.6 kilograms of cannabis leaf, only 500 grams was manicured, unseedy head (the highest quality). The remainder was comprised of leafy heads and seeds and ground leaf. 
       
       
      • The bulk of the cannabis was described by the applicant as  
      “rubbishy” 
      . 
       
       
      • The applicant’s evidence was that he had made the cannabis resin himself from  
      “the rubbishy cannabis matter that was in those bags” 
       for his personal use. 
       
      
    44 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the bulk of the cannabis leaf and resin was of low quality and therefore difficult to market. The quality of the drugs, it was said, impacted on the potential profitability of the enterprise, a significant feature of the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    45 The complaint made was that the sentencing judge, in effect, expressed the view that the quality of the drug was irrelevant. The sentencing judge stated, inter alia:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… This Court is not here to reach any firm conclusions about the quality of the merchandise for sale or supply by the offender and it is not even here to reach any conclusions about whether he was a successful supplier of cannabis. The only conclusion I am required to reach is whether he was in fact engaged in this, what the Crown describes as, organised criminal activity.” 
         (Remarks on Sentence, pp.3-4) 
        
       
      
    46 It was contended, in this respect, that the sentencing judge was in error. This was asserted upon the basis that it was relevant to an assessment of the objective criminality of the offending conduct to assess the likely profitability of the enterprise. Reliance was placed upon what was said by Grove J in Regina v Blair (2005) 152 A Crim R 462 at 472, [56]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A prominent reason for determining that the offence does not answer the description of one that falls into the mid-range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind is that … the weight of the prohibited drug was in the lower part of the range of defined commercial quantity and it was an extremely low purity.” 
        
       
      
    47 In response, the Crown contended that the legislation relating to the supply of prohibited drugs involves a scale of seriousness that is reflected in the increase in maximum penalties available as the quantity of prohibited drugs increases. This, it was said, reflects the legislature’s view that the greater the quantity of prohibited drugs supplied, the more serious is the criminality. 
     
      
    48 The Crown further observed that the comments by the sentencing judge and which are extracted above, were made in the context of his assessment of whether or not the applicant was involved in “organised criminal activity”. 
     
      
    49 The Crown alternatively argued that if there was error in not taking into account the quality of the cannabis then it did not appear that his Honour had given any impermissible weight to that fact by increasing the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    50 This was not a case in which the evidence established in any detail or specificity the purity levels of the cannabis leaf or cannabis resin. I do not consider that the sentencing judge was in error in relation to the significance of the quality of the material when the evidence did not, in my opinion, oblige him or permit him to reach any worthwhile conclusions about the quality of the cannabis materials. 
     
      
       
       
      (d) Ground 4: His Honour failed to take into account the fact that the applicant was likely to have consumed himself some of the cannabis leaf and resin 
       
      
    51 On behalf of the applicant, reliance was placed on his evidence to that effect that much of the material was for his own use. By his plea, it was acknowledged that at least some of both the cannabis leaf and cannabis resin was in his possession for the purpose of supply to others. However, it was argued that it was a mitigating factor that it was likely that some of it would be for his own use. 
     
      
    52 In support of this contention, it was said that there was no dispute but that the applicant had been a significant and chronic smoker of cannabis. Accordingly, so the argument ran, there was little reason to doubt his claim that he would have used some, if not most, of the leaf and resin himself. 
     
      
    53 The criticism made is that nowhere in the remarks on sentence did the sentencing judge comment on how the applicant’s intention to use some of the material himself impacted on the objective criminality of the offence. The greater the likelihood of personal use, the less would have been available for supply to others. This, it was said, would go in mitigation of the penalty. 
     
      
    54 Accordingly, the submission was that the sentencing judge over-valued the objective criminality of each of the charges. 
     
      
    55 The Crown relied upon the amount specified in the indictment and the agreed statement of facts and certificate from the Division of Analytical Laboratories which were tendered without objection. 
     
      
    56 The plea of guilty, it was observed by a person with knowledge of the relevant facts, is to be taken as a formal admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence. 
     
      
    57 The evidence the applicant gave as to personal use was said to be vague. No attempt was made to quantify the amount that he would have consumed himself. 
     
      
    58 The Crown further contended that the sentencing judge was in the best position to make an assessment of the applicant from seeing him give evidence and from hearing the evidence. The sentencing judge plainly did not accept that the applicant had been truthful and reliable in a number of respects. 
     
      
    59 Reliance was also placed upon the fact that the sentencing judge did find that he began the cultivation “not only for his own purposes” but in a commercial way for the purpose of supplying to Knight and others (remarks on sentence, p.7). 
     
      
    60 The sentencing judge correctly emphasised that the applicant’s credibility was undermined by his conflicting evidence and his initial untruthfulness in the ERISP. In those circumstances, his Honour was not constrained to accept the applicant’s evidence that the cannabis material was primarily for his own use. The sentencing judge did not, in my opinion, overvalue the objective criminality of each of the charges. 
     
      
       
      (e) Ground 5: His Honour failed to take into account the applicant’s abstinence from cannabis, his steps towards rehabilitation and the low likelihood of re-offending 
       
      
    61 Mr Boulten submitted that the evidence established that the applicant was making substantial progress towards his rehabilitation. He referred to “clear signs” that he was recovering from chronic cannabis use. Reference was made to the positive steps the applicant had taken towards rehabilitation. 
     
      
    62 The sentencing judge referred to the contents of the pre-sentence report, which contained the relevant history. As the Crown observed, the references to this report, although brief, reflect the fact that his Honour had due regard to it. The finding of special circumstances, as the Crown submitted, reveals that his Honour had turned his mind to the relevant aspects of the applicant’s progress. I do not consider there is any substance to this ground. 
     
      
       
      (f) Ground 6: The sentences were manifestly excessive 
       
      
    63 On the conclusion earlier expressed, the sentencing judge erred in giving undue weight to the applicant’s 1991 conviction and in characterising the offences as part of an organised criminal activity. 
     
      
    64 The issue then becomes whether the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive in light of those conclusions. In other words, was the objective criminality of the offences assessed at an appropriate level, having regard to the other findings made and the relevant circumstances of the offences. 
     
      
    65 In considering the sentence imposed, it is also, of course, necessary to have regard to the applicant’s subjective circumstances. In this respect, there were favourable matters in terms of the applicant’s work history and the fact that he has not previously had a custodial sentence imposed upon him. Regard is also to be had to the references which were tendered at the sentencing hearing. 
     
      
    66 The question of penalty involves the relationship between s.3 (which defines “cannabis leaf” and “cannabis resin” and s.32 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act which prescribes penalties for offences dealt with on indictment not involving commercial quantities and the present offences fall within that category. The supply offences, as earlier indicated, were created by s.25 of the Act. 
     
      
    67 The Judicial Commission statistics which were provided to the Court in respect of s.25 supply prohibited drug (including deemed supply, cannabis resin – less than the commercial quantity) reveal terms of sentence in respect of seven cases of which only three were subjected to custodial sentences. In one case, the offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years, a second to 48 months and a third to 12 months imprisonment. The sentences were imposed from October 1999 to September 2006. 
     
      
    68 In respect of the same offences, the statistics in respect of non-parole period and fixed terms in relation to three cases reveal six months in one case, 12 months in a second case and 24 months in a third case. The statistics, of course, do not constitute a guide against which to evaluate the sentences imposed in the present proceedings. They are general information only and the statistics are based on a very small number of cases. 
     
      
    69 In Regina v Boorer (CCA, unreported 15 November 1990, Gleeson CJ Grove and Loveday JJ), this Court dismissed an appeal imposed by the District Court in respect of one offence of supplying cannabis leaf and to another of supply cannabis resin. The sentencing judge imposed a sentence on each charge comprising a minimum term of two years and an additional term of eight months, the sentences to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    70 The offender at the time of arrest had three bags containing a block of cannabis resin weighing 28 grams (as against 194 grams in the present case) and seven small and five larger bags containing cannabis leaf and an unspecified amount of cannabis resin. The drugs seized had an estimated street value of $5,000 or, if sold in smaller quantities, not less than $9,000. The sentencing judge was satisfied the drug was for ultimate resale. The offender was aged 29 years and had prior convictions relating to the misuse of drugs.  
     
      
    71 In Sales v The Queen (CCA, unreported 2 June 1989), this Court (Kirby P, Lee and McInerney JJ) re-sentenced on appeal the appellant in respect of two charges of supplying a prohibited drug under s.25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The first charge was the supply of cannabis leaf. The second was in the same terms, except it related to the supply of cannabis resin. The drug in leaf form consisted of 827 grams of cannabis resin and 110 grams of cannabis leaf. 
     
      
    72 This Court imposed a sentence of four years and six months for the offence of supply cannabis resin. The offender was a mature man (38 years). He had been in regular employment. He had had drug convictions in 1972 (possessing a dangerous drug and possessing instruments fro smoking the drug and a conviction for selling a drug of addiction). 
     
      
    73 This latter case was plainly a more serious case to the present (827 grams v 194 grams of cannabis resin). The total amount of cannabis resin in Boorer is, as noted above, unclear from the judgment, but appears to have involved lesser quantities than in the present case. It, however, provides an example of a case falling in the general range relevant to which the present case belongs. 
     
      
    74 Notwithstanding the very persuasive submissions of Mr Boulten, I have concluded that, notwithstanding the sentencing errors identified above, the sentence imposed is within the range of sentences for the offences in question. 
     
      
    75 Courts have, of course, made it clear that drug trafficking will result in custodial sentences unless there are very special circumstances. The extent of supply in this case was of a limited nature. However, the applicant is a mature man who, by reason of his earlier experiences, can hardly be unaware of the serious consequences of dealing in prohibited drugs. 
     
      
    76 I, accordingly, would grant leave to appeal, but order that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    77 PRICE J: I agree with Hall J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      THE COURT: 
       
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1 On 22 September 2006 the appellant was convicted, following a trial before Murrell SC DCJ and jury, of importing goods into Australia to which s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 applied, to wit, prohibited imports consisting of a quantity of cocaine being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to cocaine. 
     
      
    2 The appellant has appealed against conviction. The notice of appeal was filed a few days out of time. The Crown took no objection to an extension of time being granted by the Court for the filing of the notice of appeal. An extension of time should be granted in the circumstances. 
     
      
    3 The short facts giving rise to the charge were that on 18 May 2005 the appellant had flown into Sydney Kingsford Smith airport from Jamaica and was apprehended whilst carrying a suit bag containing two packages of cocaine sewn into its linings through Customs. 
     
      
    4 The appellant made various admissions, with the result that the only real issue at the trial was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that his baggage contained a quantity of the prohibited import and that he therefore intended to import the cocaine. 
     
      
       
      The evidence at the trial 
       
      
    5 The evidence at the trial was summarised in the Crown’s written submissions. No objection was taken to the summary which was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 26 April 2005 a return airline ticket from Sydney to Jamaica via Los Angeles was booked in the appellant’s name. The outward flight was on 5 May 2005 and the return flight on 17 May 2005 - though this was subsequently changed to 18 May 2005. The ticket was paid for in cash in the sum of $2750. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant departed Australia on 5 May 2005. He checked in one item of baggage on the outgoing trip. He returned to Australia on 18 May 2005. Documentation seized from the appellant’s luggage upon his return indicated that he stayed at an establishment named ‘Big Apple’ whilst in Jamaica. 
        
       
       
        
        At 7.43 am on 18 May 2005, the appellant went through the primary line at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport and presented his passport, ticket and incoming passenger card to Customs Officer Pauline Haddad. Having passed through the primary line, the appellant then proceeded to the baggage carousel and then approached Customs Officer Carol Farrelly. The appellant was carrying a suit bag and a duty free bag. It was the suit bag which in due course was found to have cocaine secreted within it. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence of Customs Officer Farrelly was that she asked the appellant whether he had all his bags and, in response, the appellant ‘lifted his bags up and said “yes that’s all my bags”’. The appellant then answered some brief questions asked by Customs Officer Farrelly in relation to where he had been and how long he had been there. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant was then directed to go to a particular baggage examination counter where he was spoken to by Customs Officer Hoyek. Customs Officer Hoyek asked the appellant a number of questions about his baggage, his knowledge of the contents of his baggage, whether he packed his bags himself, the nature of his trip and his occupation. Customs Officer Hoyek swabbed the appellant’s bag with a wand that was able to detect traces of narcotics. This swab produced a negative result. The officer then commenced an examination of the appellant’s baggage. During this examination she noticed that the suit bag appeared heavy. She then removed what appeared to be the only contents of the suitbag. She then observed that, despite being apparently empty, the bag still seemed full. 
        
       
       
        
        Customs Officer Hoyek’s evidence, which was not objected to, was that she then had a conversation with the appellant: 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you then say this: ‘Is there anything else in the bag or did I empty it out completely’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he then say, ‘No you have emptied it out’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did you then ask ‘Why is it still so heavy’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he then reply, ‘I don’t know. Isn’t that the normal weight of the bag’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did you then say, ‘No, it’s not. It should be lighter’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he then say, ‘It’s a good quality bag. Maybe that’s why its heavier’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he then further say, ‘Why? How much lighter should it be’? 
         
        A Yes. 
         
        Q. Did you then say, ‘Well, it should be lighter than what it is currently, anyway. I’m going to put the bag through the x-ray’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Customs Officer Hoyek then asked Customs Officer Southwell to x-ray the suit bag. Also present was Customs Officer Vandam. Customs Officer Vandam had a conversation with the appellant during which the appellant told officer Vandam that he purchased the suit bag a few months previous for $85.00 at ‘Strandbags’ at North Ryde. There was evidence that Strandbags never had a store in North Ryde. 
        
       
       
        
        Following the initial x-ray, Customs Officer Vandam advised the appellant that there were ‘inconsistencies’ within the bag and he was going to take the bag to another area and may remove some of the stitching. The appellant said that ‘its quite an expensive bag’. 
        
       
       
        
        While the bag was being inspected, Customs Officer Hoyek had a further conversation with the appellant in relation to the suit bag. The evidence of Customs Officer Hoyek was as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you then say, ‘Did you check the bag on your way back from Jamaica to here?’ 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he say, ‘I carried it the whole way from Jamaica to here’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did you then say, ‘Why didn’t you check the bag in?’ 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he reply: 
         
          
          ‘Because when I left from Sydney to Los Angeles I thought I had lost the bag in LA but didn’t realise they had checked it through all the way to Jamaica, so I decided on the way back I was going to carry it all the way just in case that happened again’? 
          
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did you then say, ‘Okay, so what you’re saying is that your black suit bag didn’t leave your possession on your trip back’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he say, ‘That’s right’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did you then say: 
         
          
          ‘And that you packed it in Jamaica in the hotel; took all your bags to the airport; then you didn’t check in any of your bags; that you carried all your bags on the plane with you from Jamaica through Los Angeles, all the way to Sydney. Is that right’? 
          
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he say, ‘That’s right’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst this conversation was occurring, other Customs Officers cut along the sewn lining of the suit bag and discovered, concealed within the lining, an object covered in brown tape between two foam mats. Within the brown tape wrapping the officers discovered a white pasty substance that was in due course tested and found to be cocaine. 
        
       
       
        
        The suit bag, with the appellant’s clothing and other possessions removed, but with packages of cocaine still within the lining, was weighed by Customs Officers. It weighed 5.215 kilograms. 
        
       
       
        
        The packages within the suit bag were in due course removed and analysed by officers of the Australian Federal Police. The gross weight of the cocaine was found to be 3.2259 kilograms. The cocaine had a purity of between 69.7% and 73.4%. Accordingly the weight of pure cocaine was estimated to be 2.3310 kilograms. Evidence was led without objection that the wholesale value of this amount of cocaine was $548,250. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant was asked some further questions by Customs Officers at the airport. During that conversation, the following exchange occurred: 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you recall that you told me that you purchased the bag in North Sydney at a company called Strand Bag? 
         
        A. I recall our conversation. It was, it was out towards Ryde, North Ryde,. 
         
        Q. North Ryde? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
        Q. Yeah. 
         
        A. I did say that and I did say that it was purchased a few months ago from …(indistinct)…but I was guessing, guessing it was stolen. 
         
        Q. All right. Do you recall that - do you recall that you told me on our previous occasion at the duty barrier that the purchase price of the bag was eighty five dollars. Is that correct? 
         
        A. I was guessing the price it had. Look, I, I really, I’d rather not say anything until I’ve got some advice from here on in if that’s okay. If you’ll just let me know what’s going on, so.” 
        
       
       
        
        The accused gave evidence at the trial and was cross examined. He denied knowing anything about the cocaine that was found in his suit bag. His evidence included that he purchased the suit bag at a store in Burwood and was mistaken when he told the Customs Officers that he purchased the bag at Strandbags at North Ryde. His evidence was that when he packed his suitbag in Jamaica ‘it didn’t seem suspiciously heavy’ to him. He also said that ‘there wasn’t really a lot of security’ at his hotel in Jamaica. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant called two other witnesses. The first was a friend of his, Ms Stynes, who gave evidence that she saw the appellant packing his bag the night before he left for Jamaica. Her evidence was that the bag she saw him packing was similar to the suitbag that the appellant returned to Australia with and that contained the cocaine. The second witness was a private investigator who had been retained by the appellant’s solicitors to travel to Jamaica and ‘test the veracity of the security of the hotel’.” 
        
       
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    6 The appellant relied upon five grounds of appeal. The first four grounds of appeal were as follows: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1:  
      The trial of the appellant miscarried through the use made by the Crown Prosecution of the evidence given by Customs Officer Carol Farrelly that the appellant had lifted the suit bag he was carrying to ‘about shoulder height’. This evidence was not apparently anticipated to be part of the prosecution case and was not the subject of any significant cross examination of the appellant, but it was given prominence in the closing address of the Crown as behaviour showing ‘cockiness’ on the part of the appellant and that it demonstrated him to be a person who was ‘over confident’ in the knowledge that he had drugs in the suit bag. This evidence was left to the jury in the summing up of the trial judge as a feature of the circumstantial case establishing the guilt of the appellant. 
       
       
      Ground 2:  
      The trial of the appellant miscarried by reason of the introduction into evidence of the opinion of prosecution witness regarding the weight of the suit bag carried by the appellant. 
       
       
      Ground 3:  
      The trial of the appellant miscarried through the introduction of evidence of the opinion of Federal Agent Ivan Perisa regarding the ‘nature of allegations involving corrupt baggage handlers at Qantas’, in particular the evidence led from the witness of the fact that these cases do not involve, in the words of the Crown Prosecutor, ‘an unknowing courier’ and again using the words of the Crown Prosecutor, that ‘they always involve a person who knows they have drugs’. These questions introduced the fact of knowledge of drug couriers that there were drugs imported in other cases which was essentially, irrelevant to the case against the appellant. 
       
       
      Ground 4:  
      The trial miscarried by reason of questions asked in cross examination of the appellant by the Crown Prosecutor, which implied that the appellant should call two named persons to give evidence, accompanied by the further implication that the appellant’s failure to call those named persons as witnesses was of relevance or significance. 
       
      
    7 No objection was taken at the trial by counsel for the appellant to any of the matters raised by those grounds of appeal. Senior counsel, who appeared on the appeal (but not at the trial), accepted that he required the leave of the Court pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon those grounds. 
     
      
    8 The Court refused leave under r 4 in respect of appeal grounds 1-4 and indicated that it would provide its reasons with the substantive judgment 
     
      
    9 Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence given by the judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.” 
        
       
      
    10 The requirements of r 4 do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside - R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536. 
     
      
    11 In R v Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 191 this court held: 
     
      
       
        
        “…it is the duty of counsel appearing at the trial to take objection to matters which, in their view, are irregular, or which might be unduly prejudicial to their client, and in particular to raise, in relation to the summing up, any matters which the trial judge may have overlooked or which, in their view, he has put erroneously.” 
        
       
      
    12 A failure by counsel to perform this duty may be explicable because: 
     
      
      (a) he overlooked the point or was unaware of the law on the subject; 
       
      (b) he deliberately said nothing hoping to gain a tactical advantage at a later stage; or 
       
      (c) he took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, he saw no injustice or error in what was done -  
      Tripodina 
       (at 193 and 191). 
       
      
    13 Generally speaking, leave under r 4 will only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings - Tripodina (at 195) or as Mahoney JA said in R v Jeffrey (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported, at 6-7) - followed in R v DH [2000] NSWCCA 360: 
     
      
       
        
        “…unless there be a convincing reason why the matter was not raised at the trial and unless the possibility of real injustice appears, an accused should be held to what was done by or for him at trial level.” 
        
       
      
    14 The onus of establishing that leave should be granted lay with the appellant. Senior counsel for the appellant conceded that Ground 2 did not go to the root of the proceedings. He submitted that Grounds 1, 3 and 4 did and in relation to Ground 4 he referred to R v Soto-Sanchez [2002] NSWCCA 160, (2002) 129 A Crim R 279 and submitted that, as a result of the questions asked by the prosecution, there was a real risk of reversing the onus of proof and accordingly leave should be granted.  
     
      
    15 This was not a case where any of the objections now sought to be taken were of such a nature that leave should be granted in the absence of an explanation as to why the objections were not taken at the trial. No convincing reasons were advanced on appeal as to why the objections were not taken at the trial. Counsel for the appellant at the trial was very experienced. He took none of the objections now sought to be relied upon. This was a powerful indication of how the objections now raised should be viewed. It was also a powerful indication that error, if such occurred, was not error of a kind which might produce a miscarriage of justice - R v Button (2002) 129 A Crim R 242. 
     
      
    16 In the opinion of the Court, the matters complained of did not go to the root of the proceedings, nor did it appear that the matters complained of were other than matters which counsel for the appellant, in the atmosphere of the trial, saw as involving no injustice or error. The evidence of lifting the suit bag was relevant, it was not objected to and its weight was for the jury. The evidence concerning Qantas baggage handlers came in response to the defence raising that corrupt Qantas baggage handlers had been involved in drug importations which, if relevant, permitted explanation of the witnesses’ knowledge of the nature of the importations. Any implication that the applicant should have called other witnesses is not easy to see, and if it was apparent at the trial the appellant’s counsel apparently did not think it of significance. This was not a case where a real risk of reversing the onus of proof existed. The objections, if taken at the trial, could have been dealt with by the trial judge at that time. The Court confirms its conclusion that no leave pursuant to r 4 should be granted. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The verdict of the jury is unreasonable having regard to the evidence 
       
      
    17 The Crown case, in relation to the appellant’s knowledge of the cocaine secreted in his suit bag, was circumstantial. In her closing address, the Crown Prosecutor drew attention to a number of circumstances from which, it was submitted, the jury would infer, beyond reasonable doubt, knowledge of the cocaine on the part of the appellant. The circumstances included the following, as fairly summarised in the Crown submissions on appeal - 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The fact that the appellant brought the cocaine into Australia in his own suitbag. The Crown drew attention to the implausibility of a scenario whereby a person or persons, without the knowledge of the appellant, would conceal over half a million dollars worth of cocaine in the appellant’s suitbag in the absence of any obvious way of recovering the cocaine without the accused knowing once the appellant and his baggage had arrived in Australia. There was no arrangement for the appellant to hand the bag to someone upon his arrival in Australia. The appellant did not give anyone that he socialized with in Jamaica his address in Australia. The point was that this supposedly alternative scenario was not a rational or reasonable hypothesis. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The cocaine was apparently tailor made for and sewn into the lining of the suitbag. It was not simply placed in the bag. It could not have been quickly and easily inserted in the bag (for example by an intruder in the appellant’s hotel room) without the knowledge of the appellant. The opportunities to do so would not be great. It would also not have been quick and easy for someone to remove the cocaine. It was a professional concealment. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) The suitbag weighed over 5 kilograms (because of the presence of the cocaine) when it was apparently empty. The suggestion was that this unusual and suspicious feature of the bag would have been obvious to the appellant during his return voyage. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The appellant’s demeanour at the airport when first spoken to by Customs Officer Farrelly: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            He [the appellant] approached her [officer Farrelly], she asked him, after he said where are the exits, she asked him words to the effect ‘is this all your luggage’ and he held up his luggage. Now it wasn’t light you might think, it was at least 12 to 13 kilos that suit bag and he held it up to shoulder height when he was apparently delirious with fatigue, or almost delirious with fatigue, another factor, an important factor. In fact his evidence was ‘I felt extremely tired, almost delirious and jet lagged would be the best term for it’. They were his precise words he used, yet he held up the bag like that. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            As I put to him about that, you might think that’s consistent with a rush of adrenalin, a bit of perhaps even cockiness as he comes through knowing or believing that he has got the drugs in the bag. Sort of over confident, look I’ve only got this, I’m innocent, I have got nothing in my bag. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (e) On the appellant’s own account, the suit bag was his own, was packed by him and only he was to have custody of it. It remained in his custody or control during the entire trip home because he took it on the aircraft as cabin baggage. 
        
       
       
        
        (f) The appellant changed his initial story about where he bought the suitbag from. His original claim that he bought it from Strandbags in North Ryde was proved to be false. 
        
       
       
        
        (g) The Crown also drew attention to a number of implausible or inconsistent aspects of the appellant’s evidence relating to his purchase of the suitbag in Burwood and the particular features he was looking for, the purchase of the ticket in cash by his friend, the unusual nature of the appellant’s trip to Jamaica (he travelled alone, which was unusual for him; he stayed in the one place for the entire trip and socialized with taxi drivers and an interpreter; he purchased a telephone in Jamaica), his evidence that there was lax security at his hotel (yet he kept a large amount of cash and his other documents in his room). Nothing was apparently moved or disturbed in his room in Jamaica. His money was not stolen.” 
        
       
      
    18 In M v The Queen (1994)181 CLR 487 at 493 Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” 
        
       
      
    19 Senior counsel for the appellant considered each of the matters referred to in para [17] (a)-(f) individually. He asserted, in essence:  
     
      
      (a) the appellant was an innocent dupe; 
       
      (b) the fact that there was no obvious way of recovering the cocaine was not established. There were obvious ways of recovering the cocaine if the people at the end, from where the cocaine is imported, are given information, and sufficient information to identify the person who has had the cocaine, as it were, planted on them; 
       
      (c) whilst he accepted that the sewing of the packages of cocaine into the suit bag could not have been done quickly and easily, it was something that professionals operating in the field with the high stakes involved and with the skills that they may be expected to have, would reasonably be anticipated to be able to find their way into a hotel room and to secrete this material in a bag without the person knowing; 
       
      (d) the additional weight in the bag caused by the presence of the heroin was not so significant when there were a large number of other items in the bag; 
       
      (e) a reliable inference as to knowledge could not be drawn from the reference to the appellant’s demeanour being one of over confidence; 
       
      (f) the fact that the suit bag was the appellant’s own and packed by him and only he had custody of it was not particularly remarkable or unusual in the context of luggage that was carried onto an aeroplane; 
       
      (g) the fact that the original claim as to where the suit bag was purchased was proved to be false was not a matter of great moment as it was quite conceivable that a person might be genuinely mistaken in this regard. 
       
      
    20 We do not find such an analysis convincing, particularly as it does not give adequate recognition to the fact that in a circumstantial case the probative force of the evidence derives from its accumulation and not from individual items of evidence taken alone. 
     
      
    21 In our opinion, it was extremely unlikely that the importation into Australia of a commercial quantity of cocaine valued at over half a million dollars would be trusted to a person who was unaware of its presence and in the absence of any obvious way of recovering it without that person’s knowledge. 
     
      
    22 It was also, in our opinion, improbable that without the appellant’s knowledge someone was able to enter his room, carry out the work of sewing the packages of cocaine into the lining of the suit bag and leave the suit bag apparently untouched. 
     
      
    23 When those factors, together with the other matters referred to in para [17] are considered, it is, in our opinion, clear that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. The more so when full regard is had to the fact that the jury had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses, and in particular the appellant, give evidence and were determining an issue which involved a consideration of the evidence in the light of the common experience of human affairs.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    24 The orders of the Court are: 
     
      
       
      1. The time in which to file the notice of appeal is extended to the date the notice of appeal was filed. 
       
       
      2. Appeal dismissed.

      2007/741 R v Saul Turuta 
       
       
       
      REASONS FOR SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 5 November, 2007, the offender, Saul Turuta, was indicted before a jury in relation to two charges. First, that on 6 August, 2006, he murdered Jimmy Eli. Second, that on the same day he maliciously wounded Ukeariki Oaariki. He pleaded not guilty to both charges and the matter proceeded to trial.  
     
      
    2 On 30 November, 2007, the jury found him not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter in relation to the first charge and not guilty in relation to the second charge. He therefore comes to be sentenced in relation to the manslaughter of Jimmy Eli.  
     
      
    3 The events in question took place on the afternoon of Sunday 6 August, in (or in the vicinity of) the offender's home in Airds, an outer suburb of Sydney. The offender and the deceased, Mr Eli, lived opposite each other and were well acquainted with each other. Earlier that day, the offender and his then partner, Mata Puia, had happened to meet the deceased and his friend, Mr Oaariki, at a local hotel. They had invited the deceased and Mr Oaariki to come to their home for a drink later in the day. They accepted and later that afternoon the two of them went to the offender's home where all four of them sat drinking on the porch outside the offender's front door. 
     
      
    4 After a while, Ms Puia left them and went inside to join some young girls who were watching television in the lounge room. 
     
      
    5 A little later an argument developed inside the house between Ms Puia and the offender after Ms Puia had turned down some music which the offender had been listening to. The offender grabbed Ms Puia by the hair with one hand and held her by the throat with the other. She was screaming for him to let her go. At about this point, the deceased, Mr Eli, came into the house and tried to separate them and to restrain the offender.  
     
      
    6 Mr Oaariki also came in and assisted the deceased in trying to restrain the offender. A fight between the three men ensued. On one version of the evidence, at least one other man, and possibly two, came in and joined the fight against the offender. 
     
      
    7 I should say at this point that although there were numerous eye witnesses to the events, both within the house and outside, it is very difficult to get a clear picture of what happened from the time this conflict started. I am certain that most of the witnesses, if not all of them, were trying their hardest to accurately recount their observations as they recalled these events 15 months later. But, as so often happens with extraordinary events which happen quickly, unexpectedly and in a situation of stress, both observations and memories varied enormously between the various witnesses. There were a few common themes, but most of them related more to peripheral matters than to the central conflict which ultimately resulted in the death of Jimmy Eli.  
     
      
    8 A few things can be discerned. At one point all three protagonists, (that is the offender, the deceased, and Mr Oaariki), exited the offender's house through the front door. According to some witnesses, they were still fighting when they moved outside. According to others, the fight had broken up by then. Whatever was happening, there was a great deal of shouting going on which attracted a large number of observers to the scene. One thing that almost all witnesses described was a young man throwing a garbage bin towards the offender. The bin struck the offender's front door which, in turn, struck the offender. The precise point at which this happened is unclear, however it was probably shortly after this that the offender went back inside the house and walked into his kitchen. There he took a large knife and went back outside. The women and girls inside the house were screaming at him not to take it. Once he was outside, accounts varied as to precisely what happened.  
     
      
    9 In all probability, the deceased, Mr Eli, was returning home with his wife when the offender appeared at his front door carrying the knife. Some witnesses then described the offender as charging towards the deceased while others had the deceased running back towards the offender.  
     
      
    10 One thing is certain, namely that at some stage during that afternoon, a handrail beside the porch and steps outside the offender's front door was torn out of its cement base, something which would have required a considerable degree of force. A number of witnesses described the offender and the deceased as struggling with each other shortly after the offender had come outside with the knife, and the two of them going over the railing and dislodging it. I think it is likely that this damage was caused at this time. This was very close to the offender's front door, which makes it likely that the deceased did run back towards the offender at that time. However, it is also likely that the offender moved forward to meet the deceased, thus giving credence to both accounts. 
     
      
    11 A number of the witnesses described the offender as stabbing the deceased in the back on more than one occasion during the course of their confrontation. Where this took place is by no means clear, nor whether they were standing up or grappling on the ground. It seems that none of the witnesses saw the deceased being stabbed in the stomach.  
     
      
    12 Shortly afterwards, the deceased staggered away, bleeding profusely and collapsed on the ground.  
     
      
    13 A little later, a further fight took place between the offender and Mr Oaariki during which Mr Oaariki apparently sustained three stab wounds. Again, no one seems to have seen these wounds being inflicted. A neighbour of the offender, a Mr Maile, took the knife from the offender when he and Mr Oaariki were on the ground. At about that point the fight broke up. Mr Oaariki walked away and he also later collapsed onto the footpath. The offender went back inside his home, collected a jacket which he put on, and then returned and sat on some steps outside his house. 
     
      
    14 Several of the bystanders had made Triple O calls and shortly afterwards both the police and the ambulance arrived at the scene. The ambulance officers quickly recognised that the deceased required the most immediate attention and he was urgently conveyed to Campbelltown Hospital. However, all attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead shortly after his arrival at the hospital. 
     
      
    15 Both Mr Oaariki and the offender were separately taken to Liverpool Hospital. Mr Oaariki was found to have sustained three stab wounds; two in the area of his right shoulder and one to the back of his right upper arm. None of them was life threatening and it seems that only one of them required suturing. Mr Oaariki was discharged from hospital the following day. The offender was found to have bruising to the left eye and a fractured nose. He had swelling and contusions on both hands. He also was discharged the next day and was taken directly to Liverpool police station. 
     
      
    16 On the evening of that day, 7 August, an ERISP took place with the offender at the Liverpool police station. The offender described the events of the previous afternoon up to the time when he was fighting with the deceased and Mr Oaariki inside his home. He said that at one stage he was on the ground and the other two were on top of him and he thought that he was going to die. At that point he ""blanked out"", as he called it. He said that he had no memory of anything to do with the knife until some time later when he felt someone take the knife away from him.  
     
      
    17 Later that evening the offender was charged with the murder of Jimmy Eli. He has been in custody ever since. 
     
      
    18 At the trial of the offender, evidence was given by various bystanders and the relevant police officers. In addition, Dr Judith Perl gave evidence as to the likely blood alcohol reading of both the offender and the deceased at the relevant time, which was at about 6.50 pm on the evening of 6 August. Without going into the details of her calculations, she said that the offender's most likely level at that time was between .115 and .130 grams per 100 millilitres of blood. At this level he would have suffered impairment of his cognitive functions, his perception, judgment and co-ordination. He would have been able to make decisions and control his actions, although his decisions might have been impaired. Alcohol could not account, the doctor said, for any memory loss the offender suffered during that period. 
     
      
    19 The deceased's blood alcohol reading was considerably higher, at .185 grams per 100 millilitres of blood. 
     
      
    20 A significant medical issue emerged at the trial relating to the cause of the deceased's death. At post-mortem he was found to have sustained numerous injuries, including several stab wounds and some serious bruises and abrasions. The most serious injuries were two stab wounds to the back and one to the lower part of the chest. The two back wounds, one on the left side and one on the right, had penetrated each of the deceased's lungs. The chest wound had entered the pleural cavity, penetrated the diaphragm and then entered the liver where it had travelled for about two and a half centimetres.  
     
      
    21 Doctor Langlois, who performed the post-mortem, considered that death had resulted from the combined effects of these three injuries. However, a real issue emerged as to whether chest wound might itself have inevitably caused Mr Eli's death, thus rendering the back wounds irrelevant in terms of causation. This was significant because, as already mentioned, none of the bystanders had seen the chest wound being inflicted.  
     
      
    22 It was suggested, on behalf of the offender, that this wound might well have been unintentionally inflicted whilst the offender and the deceased were grappling with each other. It being for the Crown to prove that the fatal injury was deliberately, as opposed to accidentally, inflicted, it was put to the jury that if they considered that the chest wound was the primary cause of death, then they could not be satisfied of this matter. An outright acquittal would then have resulted. The jury's verdict means that they must have rejected this submission. They could have done so on two possible bases; either by finding, in accordance with the opinion expressed by Dr Langlois, that the two back wounds substantially contributed to the death of the deceased, (for on any view of the evidence, those wounds must have been deliberately inflicted); alternatively, by finding that the chest wound was deliberately inflicted, (thus rendering the medical debate irrelevant to their findings). It makes little difference, in my view, which route they took to reach this finding. In either case they found that the offender deliberately inflicted the wounds which led to Mr Eli's death.  
     
      
    23 A much more significant issue is how the jury came to reach its verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. According to the written directions given to the jury, there were three possible routes by which they could have reached this verdict. In my view, by far the most likely of these was that of excessive self defence. This fits easily with the jury's acquittal in relation to the second charge.  
     
      
    24 In relation to the murder charge, it means that they accepted that the offender genuinely believed that it was necessary to act as he did in order to defend himself, but that the stabbing of the deceased was an excessive response in the circumstances. On the other hand, the stabbing of Mr Oaariki, which involved the infliction of much less serious injuries, was not excessive. 
     
      
    25 Both the Crown Prosecutor and Ms Hickleton, who appeared for the offender, agreed that this is the most likely basis upon which the jury reached its verdict. The offender, therefore, comes to be sentenced on that basis. 
     
      
    26 When the sentencing proceedings were on foot, the Crown Prosecutor gave notice of a related charge which had been transferred to this court pursuant to s166 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986. This was a charge for assaulting Mata Puia on the afternoon of 6 August, 2006. Ms Hickleton at first expressed concern about whether the appropriate procedures had been followed under s166, but on production by the Crown Prosecutor of a certificate under s166, which had been produced before the Local Court, and of the notice of committal which included a reference to a related charge of common assault, Ms Hickleton withdrew her objection to my dealing with the matter under s168 of the Act. 
     
      
    27 Ms Hickleton submitted that on the evidence given at trial, the offender should not be convicted of assault, as it was Ms Puia who had first become aggressive towards the offender and his actions in taking hold of her were for the purpose only of restraining her. 
     
      
    28 I do not want to spend too much time on this issue. The Crown has submitted that a cumulative sentence should be imposed in relation to the assault charge, should a conviction be entered in relation to it. However, I do not propose to accede to this proposition. Accordingly, the sole relevance of this matter is that it will constitute another conviction on the offender's criminal record: a relatively minor matter, given the seriousness of the principal offence. 
     
      
    29 I have looked at the transcript references in relation to this issue. They are not all one way, but the great preponderance of the evidence is that Ms Puia did nothing to provoke the assault upon her other than to turn down the offender's music, possibly on two or three occasions. The offender's actions in taking her by the neck and grabbing her hair were, in my finding, done in anger. I therefore formally enter a conviction against him in relation to the offence of assault. 
     
      
    30 I return to discuss matters relevant to the primary offence for which the offender is to be sentenced.  
     
      
    31 The offender is now 44 years old. Little is known about his background, except that he was born in the Cook Islands. He had lived in the same house at Airds, which was a Housing Commission home, since 1991 or 1992. Very significantly, he has no prior criminal convictions of any kind. It would appear that he has not completed any skilled training courses. At the time of this offence, he was employed as a casual worker at Woolworths. 
     
      
    32 The offender had been living with Ms Puia since about January 2006. Before that he had been in a long term relationship with a woman I shall refer to as Ms R. They have three daughters now age 10, 6 and 5. The offender kept close contact with his children after separating from their mother and remained, on all accounts, a loving and attentive father. 
     
      
    33 Two weeks after the offender went into custody in relation to this offence, Ms R was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Since then her condition has deteriorated rapidly. She now has serious mobility problems and is dependent on her mother as her primary carer. She is unable to care for the children as previously and the situation can only get worse. 
     
      
    34 Her mother, who is the only family member available to assist them, has her own health problems. The children have maintained close contact with the offender and visit him regularly. They have been able to do this through the good services of ""Shine for Kids"", which has transported them to his correction centre every two weeks.  
     
      
    35 Ms R expressed concern that, with the continuing deterioration of her own condition, and the concerns about her mother's health, the offender, whom she described as ""a wonderful father"", should be in a position to assist in the care of his children as soon as circumstances will allow. One cannot but feel the greatest sympathy for Ms R and the three children. The real question is whether this can be taken into account in the sentencing of the offender. The authorities indicate that it is only in a most exceptional case that a sentencing court will mitigate sentence because of the impact of the offender's imprisonment upon third parties. 
     
      
    36 This is a particularly difficult matter in the circumstances of this case. In the end I have determined that the precarious position of Ms R and the offender's three young children is sufficiently extraordinary to enable it to be taken into account in establishing special circumstances which will justify a departure from the statutory ratio between the total sentence and the non-parole period. However, given the other facts in the case, the adjustment will be a relatively minor one. 
     
      
    37 Victim impact statements were read in court by or on behalf of the deceased's widow, Tinianne, and his two children, Shontel and Nga. These very movingly attested to the great pain and grief caused to the entire family by the killing of the deceased. The court expresses its sympathy to the family of the deceased. These statements have been taken into account as provided by the legislation. 
     
      
    38 The sole aggravating factor under s21A of the Sentencing Act, 1999, is that the offence involved the use of a weapon. This is, nevertheless, a matter of considerable significance because it introduces a deterrence aspect into the sentencing process. Other people must be deterred from use of such weapons. 
     
      
    39 Balanced against this are a number of mitigating factors under the section. First, that the offence was not planned or premeditated. Next, that the offender had no record of previous convictions and was, therefore, a person of good character; and finally, that given his age and background he is most unlikely to re-offend. These are extremely significant factors. 
     
      
    40 Ms Hickleton also suggested that the offender showed remorse insofar as he said in his ERISP that he did not want to harm anyone. However, I can not accede to this proposition. According to the medical evidence, it is most unlikely that the offender in fact, blanked out, as he described in his ERISP, and I can only conclude that he made up this story in an attempt to distance himself from the events in question. In my view, his statement that he did not intend to do any harm was made in the same context and cannot be taken as an expression of contrition or remorse.  
     
      
    41 I was told, during the sentencing proceedings, that two weeks after the commission of this offence the offender's home at Airds, together with its contents, was burned to the ground. This was treated as arson and one cannot but surmise that it was connected with the commission of this offence. However, I do not see it as a matter which can have any significant bearing on the sentencing process. 
     
      
    42 The fundamental question is where all this leads us in terms of the appropriate sentence. It was the offender's aggressive actions towards Ms Puia which initiated the confrontation in the first place. The deceased was by no means the principal aggressor. Indeed, on the bulk of the evidence, he was trying to restrain the offender. The offender was a much larger man than the deceased. In addition, as the Crown pointed out, the offender deliberately armed himself with a knife before going back outside. This is in contrast to a person under threat who opportunistically finds a weapon nearby and uses it to defend himself. Nevertheless, the jury's finding means that the offender genuinely believed that it was necessary to act as he did in order to defend himself. His state of intoxication is very likely to have had a bearing on this, given the evidence of Dr Perl, that his cognitive functions, perception and judgment would have been impaired at the time.  
     
      
    43 I have been referred to a number of sentencing decisions relating to manslaughter through excessive self defence. These have been of considerable assistance. However, ultimately each case falls to be determined according to its own particular facts, balancing the various considerations which are to be taken into account.  
     
      
    44 It goes without saying that this offence, which involved the taking of a human life, is an extremely serious one. Elements of punishment, retribution and deterrence must all play their part in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    45 As I indicated earlier, I do not propose to impose a cumulative sentence in relation to the assault upon Ms Puia. The circumstances of that offence were so bound up with the principal offence that it would, in my view, be inappropriate to do so.  
     
      
    46 The offender has been in custody since 6 August, 2006 and his sentences must commence on that date.  
     
      
    47 Saul Turuta, in relation to the assault of Mata Puia I sentence you to imprisonment for 3 months to commence on 6 August, 2006.  
     
      
    48 In relation to the manslaughter of Jimmy Eli, I sentence you to imprisonment, consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months, to commence on 6 August, 2006 and to expire on 5 February, 2011. That is the earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole.  
     
      
    49 The balance of the term of the sentence is to be 2 years 6 months, commencing on 6 February, 2011 and expiring on 5 August, 2013, a total sentence of 7 years.
