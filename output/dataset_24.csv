     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted following a trial with a jury of 15 counts relating to various sexual offences allegedly committed against his two stepdaughters between 1979 and 1982. The evidence was received over 7 days. After deliberating for approximately 2 days the jury returned majority verdicts (being verdicts of 11 jurors to 1) of guilty in relation to all 15 counts. The appellant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 11 years 6 months with an effective non-parole period of 7 years. 
     
      
    2 The first 12 counts on the indictment concerned alleged assaults committed upon the appellant’s older stepdaughter KG. The remaining 3 counts concerned the appellant’s youngest stepdaughter SK. Both complainants gave evidence at the trial and both were cross-examined. Their evidence was that the appellant engaged in a course of escalating sexual misconduct over a number of years with each of them, progressing from “cuddles” and “fondling” to digital and vaginal penetration and masturbation of the appellant’s penis to more serious forms of sexual intercourse (in the case of KG: fellatio, cunnilingus and penile/vaginal intercourse; in the case of SK: penile/vaginal intercourse). The alleged behaviour of the appellant with each complainant had some marked similarities. 
     
      
    3 The indictment contained offences allegedly committed when KG was aged between 12 and 14 years and SK between 10 and 11 years. It was the Crown case that the counts in the indictment were representative being identifiable incidents during a course of offending conduct. Evidence of uncharged sexual acts was admitted as “relationship evidence” described as providing a realistic “context” to the evidence of the alleged offences. In part it was also relied on as evidence of tendency and coincidence. 
     
      
    4 The appellant does not complain about the admission of this evidence. However, evidence was admitted of violent behaviour by the appellant over a period of time. The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred when admitting this evidence and in addition failed to give the jury adequate instructions in relation to it.  
     
      
       
      The evidence 
       
      
    5 Before considering the particular grounds of appeal it is necessary to understand the evidence tendered by the Crown to provide the context in which the evidence of violent behaviour by the appellant was admitted. 
     
      
    6 The appellant married MW in 1974. MW had three children from a previous marriage: KG who was aged 7 in 1974, SK who was aged 4 and SR who was aged 2 at the time of the marriage. MW also had an adopted son DR who was aged 7 at the time. The appellant developed a paternal relationship with MW’s children and their surnames were changed to his by deed poll in 1978. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of the complainant KG 
       
      
    7 KG gave evidence that the appellant used to lie on the lounge watching television in the lounge room. There was a kangaroo skin rug on the lounge. She regarded it as a treat to lie on the lounge with him under the rug; she was allowed to stay up and watch television with the appellant while on the lounge. In the first stages this was ""cuddle time"". After 6-12 months the appellant progressed to engaging in sexual activity. Initially he would touch her over her clothes but it progressed to touching underneath her clothing. She would be wearing a nightie and underpants. He touched her on the chest but more towards the bottom half of her body including her vagina. He also got her to touch his penis, initially over his clothing but it progressed to him undoing his fly and exposing his penis and having her touch it. He said that this was their ""special time together"" and she understood it was not to be discussed. She said she loved the attention at first, like any little girl would but she also felt it was wrong and she could not say or do anything about it. The appellant would give her 50 cents to come and give him a cuddle on the lounge. She did not tell anyone what the appellant was doing to her because she was too scared. 
     
      
    8 KG described the sexual touching on the lounge progressing to the point where the appellant was digitally penetrating her vagina. When these things were happening on the lounge it was when she and the appellant were alone; her mother was at work and the other children had been sent to bed. 
     
      
    9 KG gave evidence that the appellant was violent. She recalled getting beatings with a rod or cane for slight infractions. She was hit on the back of the legs and the backside. Sometimes she was hit on the hand with the rod. She saw him use a leather strap or the rod on her siblings. She did not recall her younger brother SR being hit but recalled the appellant regularly beating SK and said that DR got beatings all the time. The appellant drank alcohol every day, drinking long necks, stubbies and sometimes spirits. He was emotionally abusive to her mother, who consequently had no confidence. Her mother had a number of nervous breakdowns because of the emotional abuse and her mother was in hospital for a nervous breakdown when Counts 9 and 10 occurred. 
     
      
    10 The family went on a holiday to Sussex Inlet in late December 1979 to early January 1980 with family friends and stayed in a cabin. One day she was in Swan Lake with the appellant. The lake was fairly shallow for about 50 - 100 metres. The appellant swam to where she was in the lake and touched her over her swimwear and then under her swimwear with his fingers and moved his hands over her breasts, then he would throw her in the air or she would dive off his shoulders and when she was in the water again he would touch her again. 
     
      
    11 A couple of days after that, KG got badly sunburnt and had to stay indoors for the day while her mother and the other children went shopping. She was in their cabin reading a book and the appellant came in, shut and locked the door and closed the louvres. He laid a towel across the bed and asked her to lie on it. He removed the bikini bottoms she was wearing and then performed oral sex upon her. She said he sucked her vagina for some 4 to 5 minutes and also ""used his fingers"" on her (Count 1). He took some Vaseline from a jar near the bed and rubbed it on the outside and inside of her vagina, got her to get on her hands and knees and inserted his penis into her vagina from behind. He moved his penis in and out and ejaculated inside her (Count 2). 
     
      
    12 Around the middle of 1980, a few months before she had an operation on her hand, KG was off school for a day, she was not sure why, and it was just herself and the appellant at home in Lithgow. He told her to go into the main bedroom with him. He did not say why. He told her to undress and he helped her to undress. He then removed his own clothing and when he was naked she saw that he had an erection. He said that they were ""going to try something different today"". He got her to suck his penis and he held the back of her head so that she could not move away. She was scared, anxious, and afraid of what he would do if she refused. He then pushed her onto the bed and sucked on her vagina for 3 or 4 minutes. He then rubbed Vaseline - which was on the bedside table - on the inside and outside of her vagina and had penile/vaginal intercourse with her. She told him that she didn't want to do this but he did not stop. He continued for about 5 to 10 minutes before he removed his penis and ejaculated on her stomach. He said to her that this was their secret and she was not to tell anyone. KG said that she did not tell anyone about this because she was scared. (Count 3). 
     
      
    13 In early August 1980, KG accidentally sliced her finger and, after microsurgery, required physiotherapy which commenced immediately after her leaving hospital. The appellant took her to physiotherapy at Katoomba for the majority of her appointments, which were usually between 8am and 8:30am. Returning from the physiotherapy one day, the appellant pulled over and stopped on the side of the road at Blackheath near a fish and chips shop. He told her to take her underwear off. He removed a jar of Vaseline from the console and rubbed it on the inside and outside of her vagina. He also unzipped his pants and pulled his penis out. He inserted his fingers in her vagina (Count 4). He then had her rub his penis up and down with her hand until he ejaculated (Count 5). She said that the ejaculate went on his clothes and hand and he used an old coat that was in the car to wipe up. KG said she was then told to put her underwear back on and she was driven back to school. 
     
      
    14 In late September 1980, KG had a physiotherapy appointment later than usual and as a result she did not have to go to school afterwards. The appellant took her to the appointment and they then returned to the home. No-one else was home. About two weeks previously the appellant had bought her some lingerie, which was some panties that were two sizes too small. The appellant told her to go and get undressed and come into the main bedroom. He told her to put the panties on. She was wearing a training bra. She did not go into the bedroom but sat on her bed. She told him that she didn't want to do anything and he ignored her and said ""you're coming into the bedroom"". She went in because she was scared of him. 
     
      
    15 The appellant took photographs of her with a Polaroid camera with her panties on and also with them off. He then got on the bed and told her to perform oral sex on him by sucking his penis. She did that for 4 to 5 minutes (Count 6). The appellant then had her lie back down on the bed and he performed oral sex on her by sucking her vagina. He also used his fingers (Count 7). The appellant then proceeded to have penile/vaginal intercourse with her. She was on her back on the bed. He put a pillow under her pelvis and inserted his penis into her vagina. This went on for about 5 minutes. He then removed his penis and turned her around so she was on her hands and knees and he then inserted his penis from behind and had intercourse with her until he ejaculated inside her. (Count 8). 
     
      
    16 KG said that when this was happening she was scared, emotional and just did not want to be there. She said she was crying. The appellant threatened her that she was not to tell anyone. She had a shower and got dressed and by the time she got out of the shower he was not there. She looked for the photographs but could not find them. 
     
      
    17 In February or March 1982 MW was in hospital. KG said that every night while her mother was in hospital some form of sexual activity would take place in the lounge room but the main incident she recalled occurred in the bedroom. They had just come back from the hospital and the appellant sent everyone to bed. After about an hour he came and got her out of bed and took her into his bedroom. He took her nightie and underwear off. He then took photos of her again in various poses with his Polaroid camera. She said he was naked and his penis was erect. He then performed oral sex on her and had her perform oral sex on him. He then got the Vaseline and rubbed it on the inside and outside of her vagina and inserted his penis in her vagina from behind with her on her hands and knees. She was on the bed and he was standing beside it. (Count 9). After about 5 minutes he told her to lie on her back and he penetrated her vagina for another 4 to 5 minutes and then withdrew and ejaculated over her stomach (Count 10). KG was then told to put her clothes back on - she did not have an opportunity to shower or clean herself- and go back to bed. 
     
      
    18 The next morning KG got up very early; she had made a decision to tell her mother. She walked up to the hospital but by the time she got there she had talked herself out of it because she was scared of what the appellant would do to her. 
     
      
    19 Sometime in 1982 KG's brother DR ran away from home. DR had some friends who lived at the Vale of Clwyd and it was thought he might be there. The appellant told KG to get in the car because they were going to go looking for DR. They drove to an area near there but the appellant veered onto a dirt track and stopped the car in a sheltered area. 
     
      
    20 The appellant told KG to get into the back seat and to take her clothes off. The appellant told her to perform oral sex on him. She was sitting on the seat facing outwards and he was standing outside. She told him that she did not want to do anything but he said, ""You're going to do it"" and she did not believe she had a choice so she did it. When his penis was in her mouth he had his hands on her head to control her. This went on for about 5 minutes or a little less. She said she tasted pre-ejaculate and it made her feel sick (Count 11). 
     
      
    21 The appellant withdrew his penis and told KG to get out of the car and lean over the boot. She was still naked. She leaned over the boot and he inserted his penis into her vagina from behind and had intercourse for about 5 minutes (Count 12). He then withdrew, told her to put her clothes back on and get back into the car. She got into the back seat and they drove straight home without looking for DR. KG did not tell anyone about the sexual abuse until she told her husband when her child was 18 months old. The child was born in October 1990. She never told him in detail. About 2 days after telling her husband she telephoned her mother and told her that she had been sexually abused by the appellant. She said she did not go to the police at that time because, although she wanted to, she was too emotional and did not think she could cope with going through the process. In April 2006 KG made a statement to police. She was working for the Federal Police, which had in place support systems such as confidential access to welfare officers and psychologists. KG did not at any time tell her sister SK the specific details of the sexual abuse by the appellant, including that it occurred on the lounge. 
     
      
    22 In cross-examination, KG said that she was aware that about a month after she told her mother, her mother had spoken to SK. SK then told KG that she had also been abused. They had never discussed the details of the sexual assaults upon either of them. KG said her mother had asked her for the details but she refused to give them to her and had no intention of ever telling her. She said neither SK nor MW had seen her statement. 
     
      
    23 In relation to Counts 4 and 5, KG said she was wearing her summer school uniform. The car had bucket seats. There was not normally a jar of Vaseline in the console of the car. They were parked 2 to 3 metres from the road, which was single lane at that point, and down a bit from the fish and chips shop. The car was a red Holden Commodore. 
     
      
    24 In relation to Counts 11 and 12, KG said that the appellant told her to take off her underwear as she was getting into the back seat. She was then naked from the waist down. When he penetrated her vagina with his penis he had sex with her until he ejaculated inside her. He had taken his penis out through the gap in his Y-front underpants and through the zipper of his pants so that he still had his clothing on. When he told her to get back in the car she stayed in the back seat. 
     
      
    25 In relation to the incident when she was in the lake prior to Counts 1 and 2, KG said that the water was chest deep on her; the water was not very deep for about 100 to 150 metres. There were family members on the beach and in the water at the same time. 
     
      
    26 In relation to Counts 6 and 7, KG said the bed was not a waterbed. She agreed there was a waterbed there at some time but not at that time. She did not remember how old she was when the waterbed was there. 
     
      
    27 She denied that the appellant administered corporal punishment to the boys only and not the girls and that it was her mother who used the cane on the girls. 
     
      
    28 She never saw her brother SR on or under the kangaroo rug. The conduct on the lounge under the rug did not continue after the Sussex Inlet incidents. They occurred for about four or five years, after which different kinds of sexual activity occurred until around mid-1983. She was between the ages of 7 and 10 when the appellant digitally penetrated her on the lounge under the mg. 
     
      
    29 KG said that the Vaseline was sometimes in a small container and sometimes came from a larger container. 
     
      
    30 As a general rule, when her mother was working, the children would be in bed by 8:00 to 8:30pm. On occasions the appellant would allow them to stay up until MW came home. 
     
      
    31 KG denied that she entered a writing competition at school on the topic ""How good your father is"", which she won, the prize being a voucher to a store in Lithgow. She denied that she gave the appellant the voucher and accompanied him to the store where he redeemed it for some clothing . 
     
      
    32 KG gave evidence that the appellant commenced sexual activity with her 6 to 12 months after the appellant’s marriage to MW. She described the activity initially as “cuddle time”, when the appellant would touch her over her clothes while they lay under a kangaroo skin rug on a lounge watching television. KG alleged that the touching progressed from outside the clothes to touching under her clothes and underwear including her chest, “bottom half” of her body and vagina culminating in digital penetration of her vagina. She said that the appellant occasionally gave her money (50 cents) and also gave her special gifts, including a Polaroid camera and a signet ring. She said that the sexual activity occurred in the evenings when her mother was at work. She said that she initially welcomed the attention but came to understand that “it was the sort of attention that felt wrong. I couldn’t say or do anything about it”. She said that these activities occurred at least weekly. 
     
      
    33 KG also gave evidence of specific events which constitute the individual counts in the indictment. They include touching of her during a family holiday at Sussex Inlet, penile/vaginal intercourse at home, cunnilingus, fellatio and penile/vaginal intercourse, the latter occurring at home and in other places. On occasions the appellant allegedly took pornographic photographs of KG including an occasion when she was required to perform fellatio on him. During the latter event KG said that she felt “scared, emotional – I just didn’t want to be there”. She said that the appellant “actually made the threat that it wasn’t to be told to anyone.” 
     
      
    34 On an occasion in February to March 1982 when MW was in hospital KG alleged that the appellant engaged nightly in sexual activity with her. She alleged that on one occasion the appellant undressed her, took pornographic photos of her, engaged in fellatio and cunnilingus and after applying Vaseline had penile/vaginal intercourse with her in different positions. 
     
      
    35 KG gave evidence that after this incident she “made a decision to tell mum” but then “talked myself out of it … I was scared of what he would do to me.” 
     
      
    36 Count 11 charged the appellant with sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of 16 years. The allegation related to an occasion when in 1982 DR ran away from home. This occurred following an altercation which culminated in DR pushing MW to the ground. KG gave evidence that the appellant took her with him in his car to look for DR. She said that the appellant parked the car “in a protected area” off the road and demanded oral sex. She said “I told him again I didn’t want to do anything” she said that the appellant replied, “You’re going to do it.” She said in her evidence that she “didn’t believe I had a choice.” She alleged that she was required to perform fellatio on the appellant following which the appellant had penile/vaginal intercourse with her from behind while she leaned over the boot of the car.  
     
      
       
      The evidence of the complainant SK 
       
      
    37 SK said that she was sexually molested by the appellant on the lounge, always under the kangaroo skin rug. It started off with the appellant just being friendly. They would be laying on the lounge, both on their sides, with him behind her. At the start it was just friendly, a fun time. She was allowed to stay up late while all the other children were in bed. She was allowed to light his cigarette and also to open his beer and have a taste. Initially it was just cuddling but as time went on he started rubbing her chest outside her clothing and also touching her on the outside of her underpants. This happened many, many times. Then it became more sexual where he would feel under her nightie, on her skin and also down her underpants he would be feeling her and touching her vagina. It progressed to him rubbing her vagina and inserting his fingers. As they lay together with her back to him she could feel his erect penis pressing against her. She was terrified and always tense when this happened but she was not game to move or to say anything. He used to say things to her like, ""Just relax, it's okay, it won't hurt, just lay still, "" and other words to that effect. He told her that the times he let her stay up after he sent the other children to bed and allowed her a sip of his beer and to light his cigarettes, was their ""special time"" or words to the effect of ""it's our time together as father and daughter."" The cuddling and non-sexual contact went on for about a year and became more frequent as it progressed to sexual touching in 1978, when she was in third class. 
     
      
    38 At times the appellant would kiss her goodnight when she was under the rug in the lounge room. It was an adult, passionate kiss with an open mouth and with his tongue in her mouth. 
     
      
    39 She said the appellant initially was an okay father but as time went on he grew into a violent, lazy man. He was always off work, sick and did not do any work around the house. He was physically violent by hitting the children across the hands with a dowel from the dryer or used a thick, leather strap to belt them around the thighs and buttocks. SK was terrified of him and on one occasion when she had done something wrong she had hidden underneath her bed behind toys and boxes for two hours until her mother got home and had wet her pants because she was so terrified. She said the appellant flogged DR, sometimes for no reason, with the strap with extreme force so as to leave welts, while yelling at him. 
     
      
    40 In 1980 SK was dux of fifth class and MW and the appellant bought her a pair of jeans as a reward. Shortly before she was given the jeans, on a night in 1980, MW was at work and the rest of the children had been sent to bed. The appellant made her stay up and she was lying with him on the lounge under the kangaroo skin rug. SK said it seemed different this time in that the appellant seemed rushed. There wasn't the time of him being nice, by letting her change the channel on the TV, light his cigarette or other things and there wasn't as much fondling. She was wearing a nightie and underpants and lying with her back against his front. He took her underpants off and had pulled his own underpants down. He had an erection. He grabbed her hand and placed it on his penis and made her masturbate him (Count 14) with his hand over hers. When the appellant took his hand away she let go but he put it straight back on his penis, saying, ""No, leave it there"".  
     
      
    41 When this was happening she was lying more on her back and the appellant was on his side. He was using his other hand to touch and penetrate her vagina with his fingers going in and out (Count 13). She said this did not go on for very long because she was so tense; she said she was terrified, scared and tense. She did not know what to do or to say. The appellant said, ""Relax, this won't hurt"", or words to that effect and proceeded to get up and climb over her. She thought he was going to get off the lounge. He said, ""Keep your legs open "". She was on her back at this stage and he was in a kneeling position over her. He had one leg down on the floor and the other on the lounge. He told her to keep her legs apart and said ""Now just relax, it won 't hurt. He attempted to penetrate her vagina with his penis. He couldn't the first time and he tried again. She was saying, “Stop, it's hurting, it's hurting"". He replied, ""It'll be alright, just relax"". He then tried again and succeeded in penetrating her (Count 15). She was yelling out, ""Stop it, stop it, it hurts, stop it"". His penis was inside her for a short time, moving in and out, and then all of a sudden he stopped, withdrew from her and said in a frustrated tone, ""Go to bed now"". She said her vagina was hurting and it was sore for at least all of the next day. 
     
      
    42 After that incident there were further occasions of sexual activity but the appellant reverted to touching with his hands and digitally penetrating her. It became less frequent because she deliberately became more active away from the home with sport, athletics, mountain climbing, and spending time with friends in order to avoid being at home. When she was home she started going to bed earlier, even if it was nearly daylight, to avoid being the one to be kept up. The sexual activity ceased when the appellant and her mother separated in 1983. 
     
      
    43 Once the appellant was out of their lives, family life became normal. SK later told people that she had been abused as a child but did not go into detail. She thought she was strong enough to cope with it. She said she kept busy and pushed it to the back of her mind. In 1994 she received a phone call from her mother, who told her that she had received a phone call from KG telling her that she had been abused. MW asked her if the appellant had abused her and she told her yes and she had dealt with it. SK then rang KG and told her that the appellant had also abused her as a child. They did not discuss details. 
     
      
    44 After MW had learned of the abuse, SK telephoned Roslyn [Nolte], the appellant's then wife and told her that he was a child molester. She warned her never to let any of her nieces or female relations sleep there. On one occasion Ms Nolte said ""Why should I believe you"". 
     
      
    45 SK also phoned the home and the appellant answered the phone. She called him “a sick bastard” and “a child molester.” She said she made many calls to him and verbally abused him then hung up. 
     
      
    46 SK made a statement to police on 17 July 2006. She had kept busy over the years but a friend had been going through a hard time, SK was depressed, and a sentence from one of her friends made it all come back to. KG phoned her at one stage and told her she had made a statement to police, SK said “that’s weird because I’ve got an appointment with a detective to make a statement about the incidents the following week.” 
     
      
    47 In cross-examination SK denied telling KG or their mother any details. She had not shown her statement to either of them. 
     
      
    48 She said she saw the kangaroo rug in other rooms, it was used as a sick blanket. It was in the lounge room on a lot of occasions. 
     
      
    49 She agreed that her mother and the appellant had a waterbed but did not remember when it came into the house. 
     
      
    50 She denied that her mother administered discipline to the girls and the appellant administered discipline to the boys. She recalled DK was often in trouble and ran away from home for two days on one occasion. She went with her mother to look for him that time. 
     
      
    51 She said that when she was five years old all the children helped the appellant and his family to paint the house belonging to an elderly relative of his. 
     
      
    52 SK vaguely remembered that the appellant had his leg in plaster for a period of time but did not know if the sexual abuse continued while he had his leg in plaster. 
     
      
    53 SK gave evidence which in general terms reflected a progression of sexual activity similar to the evidence given by KG. SK said that the appellant progressed from “cuddling her” under the kangaroo skin rug on the lounge to touching over and then under her night dress leading ultimately to digital penetration. She complained that the appellant had given her “adult” kisses and she said that she was also given a Polaroid camera and signet ring as gifts. 
     
      
    54 SK said that when she was in Year 3 at school the appellant digitally penetrated her vagina while they were lying under the kangaroo skin rug. When this happened she said the appellant said “Just relax. Do you like it? You’ll enjoy it.” SK said that she was terrified and did not know what to say – “So I never said anything.”  
     
      
    55 SK gave evidence of other incidents including being required to masturbate the appellant, digital penetration and penile/vaginal intercourse. 
     
      
       
      The judge rules the evidence of violence to be admissible 
       
      
    56 The issue of whether the prosecution’s evidence of violence perpetrated by the appellant on the complainants and other members of the family was admissible was raised before the jury was empanelled. It was submitted that the evidence was not relevant, there being no suggestion that any of the sexual acts were committed in response to threats or actual violence on the part of the appellant. The Crown pressed the evidence on three bases: It was firstly submitted that it explained the complainants’ acquiescence, secondly it explained the complainants’ failure to complain to their mother in a timely manner and, thirdly, in relation to count 11, was relevant to prove a lack of consent with respect to KG. At the time the admissibility issue was being considered the Prosecutor indicated that it was expected that evidence would be given that the appellant threatened KG with violence if she did not comply with his demands in relation to a number of counts or, in relation to one count, if she told anyone about their “secret”. 
     
      
    57 The trial judge in an ex tempore ruling determined that the evidence should be admitted. His Honour’s reasons are captured in a portion of the transcript containing an exchange with the appellant’s trial counsel: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Well Mr Walsh it does seem to have that relevance in terms of both the evidence of the complainants in what they say as their acquiescence in this conduct they say the accused perpetrated upon them and I suppose implicitly their failure to complain about it that they were in fear of him because of violence perpetrated against them and violence they understood he was prepared to perpetrate against others. Is there anything further you want to say about the matter? 
        
       
       
        
        WALSH: Well your Honour I mean I can understand for instance when the Crown raises the matter of ‘don’t tell anyone or I’ll hurt you’ that sort of thing I mean I can understand that being admitted because it’s part of the scenario of don’t tell anyone. But the other matters of violence they’re not related and there’s no evidence they’re related to the sexual matters your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But to make a threat such as ‘don’t tell anyone or I’ll hurt you’ has added force if the complainant was aware that he had the capability of doing so and was prepared to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        WALSH: Well that goes to her not telling anyone and - 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes 
        
       
       
        
        WALSH: --I understand that, that certainly does. But doesn’t go to the commission of offences. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well to the acquiescence particularly in relation to the s 61D count. 
        
       
       
        
        WALSH: Yes. Your Honour I’ve raised it your Honour-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        WALSH: --and raise the objection it’s a matter of course as always is for your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I concede it does have a potential for prejudice but I’m given to understand the nature of the Crown case I am of the view that that is the probative value of it does outweigh that prejudice so I’m against you Mr Walsh.” 
        
       
      
    58 When opening to the jury the Crown Prosecutor raised the expected evidence of threats of violence by the appellant. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You will also hear evidence that this accused was a violent man to his children and also to his wife. You will hear evidence that at times when these sexual activities took place he would threaten the children or the girls with violence. 
        
       
       
        
        KG will tell you that the accused came into that cabin, locked the doors and secured the windows. He told her to take her bikini off and she did so. She, after initially resisting – he said, ‘Do as you’re told or you will be hurt.’ He took her bikini off and then he performed oral sex on her vagina. That’s count 1. 
        
       
       
        
        The circumstances involving count 3 relate to her being at home. He penetrated her vagina with his penis and he threatened her if she told anyone he’d hurt her. 
        
       
       
        
        They went out past the Vale of Clwydd. He told her to get into the back seat and to get undressed. She resisted. He threatened to hit her if she didn’t. He forced her to suck his penis and that is count 11 on the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        … you will hear evidence from DR, the adopted brother who is now 41 or 42, as to the assaults that took place on him, that there was a use of a leather belt. The girls will tell you about the violence, that he used to belt them with a piece of dowelling which was part of an old drying cabinet … you will hear evidence that he would belt the girls as well as DR with that item.” 
        
       
      
    59 As it happens the evidence anticipated by the Crown that the appellant had threatened violence if his demands were not complied with did not eventuate. The complainants did not say in their evidence that they were threatened with violence if they did not comply with the appellant’s demands. Furthermore, the appellant’s counsel did not challenge the complainants’ credibility on the basis that they acquiesced in performing sexual acts or because they failed to complain to their mother at the time the offences were committed. However, the appellant’s counsel did not complain that the trial had miscarried because the evidence did not follow the course anticipated in the Prosecutor’s opening. No request for a particular direction was made and there was no application that for this reason the jury should be discharged.  
     
      
       
      Evidence of violence given by KG 
       
      
    60 During the course of KG’s evidence she referred to alleged violence by the appellant on a number of occasions. She said that the appellant was violent towards herself and DR, She said, “I recall seeing him hitting my sister. I don’t recall in any detail about my younger brother S but certainly my sister would quite regularly get those same beatings.” She said that the appellant “emotionally abused” her mother and “put her mother in a place where she had no confidence.” 
     
      
    61 She was cross-examined about these allegations when the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: In relation to the discipline that was administered (the appellant) was strict with discipline wasn’t he? 
         
        A: Very strict. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And from time to time he might administer punishment to the boys by either a smack with his hand or with the belt on their backside or their legs? 
         
        A: Not just the boys, there was us girls as well. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Well I put it to you he never administered corporal punishment to you or your sister? 
         
        A: I’m telling you he did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: It was your mother who did that? 
         
        A: No my mother never disciplined us. She disciplined us when it was required but she never belted us. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You gave some evidence about a rod or a cane? 
         
        A: Yes I have. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: (The appellant) never used a rod or cane to discipline anyone did he? 
         
        A: Yes he did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: It was your mother who used the cane to do the disciplining? 
         
        A: No she did not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Well I put it to you that (the appellant) was not violent in the house as you would suggest? 
         
        A: I put it to you that he was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Sometimes he’d be cranky? 
         
        A: He’d be more than cranky. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You see you treated him as your father is that right? 
         
        A: Initially yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And right through the time that he was there? 
         
        A: Towards the end definitely not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You see the relationship between (the appellant) and your mother got nasty at the end didn’t it? 
         
        A: Yes it did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Because (the appellant) went off with another woman didn’t he? 
         
        A: That was part of it yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And that woman was a friend of your mothers at that time? 
         
        A: I believe so yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And there was a lot of bitterness at that time in relation to (the appellant) leaving your mother wasn’t there? 
         
        A: I don’t know that’s the true circumstance – yeah there – there was bitterness on a lot of part. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Yeah including your part? 
         
        A: No I was happy to see him go. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You have retained a bitterness towards (the appellant) because of the fact that he walked out on your mother and went off with another woman? 
         
        A: I retained bitterness for that man because of what he did to me as a child not because my mother kicked him out of the house.” 
        
       
      
    62 During the course of her evidence she told of the occasion when the appellant broke her mother’s nose. She said that on one occasion she saw blood in the bathroom and saw her mother’s face which was red and her broken nose was starting to swell. At the point at which the matter was first raised his Honour queried whether it was relevant. KG did not say that she saw the event and her mother apparently told her that she had fallen over. Ultimately his Honour rejected this evidence and gave the jury firm instructions to ignore it. The instructions were, in my view, adequate in the circumstances. 
     
      
    63 At the end of her cross-examination KG was challenged and it was put to her that she had tried to paint the appellant as a serial sex offender. She responded “I haven’t painted him as that. He has painted himself as that.” 
     
      
    64 She was then asked about matters of violence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: And you’ve tried to paint him as a violent man? 
         
        A: He is a violent man. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And I put it to you that he never committed any sexual offences upon you or with you? 
         
        A: He committed these offences. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And he was at never any stage violent toward you? 
        
       
      A: He was.” 
       
       
      The trial judge intervenes 
       
      
    65 After KG’s evidence was complete the trial judge took up the issue of the evidence of uncharged sexual acts and the appellant’s violence, including the evidence of injury to MW’s nose. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Ladies and gentlemen, just before the Crown calls the next witness, there’s something I want to say to you briefly and I’ll be saying something more to you about it in my summing up at the end of the trial. The Crown has led evidence not only of specific sexual acts that it says make out the various charges so far relating to this particular witness but the Crown has also led evidence of other sexual acts that the Crown alleges occurred between the accused and this complainant so far. That evidence of other acts is placed before you for quite specific purposes. As I understand the Crown case, the Crown says that notwithstanding those other acts aren’t the subject of charges that the accused faces, they go to establish on the Crown case a tendency that the accused had to act in a particular way, putting it briefly to have an unusual sexual interest in his stepdaughters. I’ll be saying something quite precise to you about it in my summing up to you but I just want to say that to give you an indication of the relevance of the evidence of those other acts. It’s also there to place in context the particular acts that are the subject of the charges. 
        
       
       
        
        You might wonder if you heard just the evidence of the specific incidents that the Crown relies upon for the charges how they might be simply occurring out of the blue, seemingly. But if you take into account on the Crown case the evidence that this was an ongoing series of behaviour and what the Crown has charged the accused with are just the specific ones that can be identified, taking into account the overall evidence you can see the context in which those specific incidents occur. Now again I’ll be saying something more about that in my summing up. 
        
       
       
        
        Part of the Crown case also as I understand it is this, that so far the complainant – as we call the alleged victim in the matter, the complainant – KG as I understand the Crown case acquiesced with the accused in what he was doing to her and didn’t complain about it at the time and so forth because she was in fear of him – in part, at least – and that therefore indicates the relevance of the accused being somewhat violent – I would take the Crown to put it – in terms of his disciplining of the children and so forth. If he was overbearing in the way he disciplined the children you might, I understand the Crown to be saying, more readily accept why the children would be afraid to complain and allow him to do the things that the Crown alleges. So that’s the relevance of this evidence of him being a man who was – I suppose, to use one term – heavy handed in corporal punishment. 
        
       
       
        
        You’ve also heard evidence that there was an occasion where there was an injury occasioned to MW’s nose and I think KG said that was in around 1976. As the evidence has emerged, that’s not relevant. She asked her mother about it after she saw blood in the bathroom and saw the injury to her mother’s nose and her mother told her that the injury occurred when she slipped over or fell or tripped or something like that. So as far as KG was concerned at the time – at the time these alleged sexual events were going on – she didn’t have any thought that the accused was responsible for that. Now, it would have relevance if she thought the accused was responsible for it because it would add to her perception of the accused being a man prone to violence, but that’s not her evidence. Her evidence is that her mother gave her an explanation for it that had no mention of the accused being responsible for it and so she simply, it would appear, just accepted at the time what her mother told her. Her mother might have told her something else years later, but that doesn’t matter. 
        
       
       
        
        So that evidence about what happened to the mother’s nose is, as it’s turned out, is completely irrelevant so I must stress to you in the strongest possible terms to put it completely to one side. It’s quite a discrete part of the evidence and I think it would be fairly easy for you simply to put that to one side, forget about it, it’s not relevant. The other things I’ve spoken of that KG said the accused did in terms of disciplining the children and so forth, that’s relevant and you can take that into account but that specific incident of something happening to the mother’s nose is completely irrelevant, so I direct you to put it to one side and just forget about that.” 
        
       
       
      Evidence of violence given by SK 
       
      
    66 SK also gave evidence during which she said that the appellant was in the early days an “okay” father. However, she said “he grew into a violent, lazy man.” She said that he was “always off work sick” and that her mother and the children would have to do all the work around the house. SK said that she had to make the appellant’s lunch when he was “actually going” to work and because her mother was a shift worker she had to cook the evening meal. She said that while others did the housework the appellant “just lay around on the lounge.” She was asked the question “what other aspect of his behaviour did you observe and the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “A: That he was violent. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And what do you mean by that? 
         
        A: He was violent even in his – the way he spoke to us. If anyone did anything wrong, any of us kids did anything wrong he would actually strike out at us – and violently abuse us as well. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When he was violent toward you was your mother there? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did he ever be violent towards you when your mother was there? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When you say he was violent, what did he do? 
         
        A: He would either cane us or hit us across our hands with a dowel from our dryer or use a thick, leather strap and belt us across our – or well actually wherever he could belt us, but usually around the thighs and buttocks. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What would you have done wrong to cause him to do that? 
         
        A: Anything or nothing. There was a time where someone had done something, one of us kids, and he actually lined us up in the lounge room, told us that someone had to own up to. If one of us did not own up to it we would all get the cane. He stood there in front of us with the wooden dowel and he repeated that question again and no-one stepped forward so myself and my brother, my older brother DR, for some reason both of us stepped forward, not that I had done anything but just for the sake of stopping the – stopping the abuse that we were getting and DR and I both got the cane more than once and if you flinched, you got another strike of the wooden dowel. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: In relation to the belt or the strap, where were you struck with it? 
         
        A: Usually across the thighs, back of the thighs and buttocks, backside. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did he ever raise his voice to you? 
         
        A: Yes. Many times. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: How would he do that? What tone would that be? 
         
        A: In anger. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Sorry? 
         
        A: In anger or-- 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Was it loud or soft? 
         
        A: Yes it was very loud. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: How did you feel about it? 
         
        A: I was terrified of him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Do you remember a time when you had done something wrong and you went into your bedroom? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What did you do? 
         
        A: I ran and hid underneath my bed in my bedroom, behind toys and boxes and I was there for two hours, until Mum got home but during that time I was so terrified that I had actually wet my underpants.” 
        
       
      
    67 During the course of her evidence she was asked whether she had ever seen the appellant “belting D.” She respondent “yes” and was then asked the following series of questions: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: What would be the nature of the belting? 
         
        A: There would – would not be a reason at the time or he would be a little bit late and he would get into an argument with DR. And he flogged him with the strap. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What sort of force was used? 
         
        A: Violently. Like I don’t know how to describe it. With extreme force like-- 
        
       
       
        
        Q: With extreme force? 
         
        A: He left marks, welts. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Left welts, whereabouts did he leave the welts? 
         
        A: On his legs. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Was he saying anything when he was belting him on the legs with all his force? 
         
        A: I can’t recall exact words but he did – he was always – he did say stuff to DR while he was doing it, that he was a-- 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Was he yelling or talking quietly? 
         
        A: Yelling.” 
        
       
       
      Further consideration of KG’s evidence about MW’s broken nose 
       
      
    68 In the course of KG’s evidence the proceedings were interrupted and defence counsel raised with the trial judge the evidence of MW’s broken nose. Counsel said that in light of the trial judge’s previous ruling with respect to the evidence of KG relating to this issue he now anticipated that MW would not give evidence about it. His Honour responded that he thought that this would be the case. Counsel then asked that the jury be discharged. It was submitted that the nature of the evidence was so prejudicial to the appellant that, notwithstanding the warnings given by the trial judge, it would have an unfairly prejudicial effect on the minds of the jury. 
     
      
    69 His Honour rejected the application indicating that in his view the nose issue was a discrete body of evidence which could be appropriately dealt with by the directions which he had given. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of MW 
       
      
    70 MW gave evidence. She was asked how she would describe the appellant’s personality and she said he was a “very domineering person, a bully, a demoralising (sic), he demoralised all the time, he took my self esteem away and I was just living on, on adrenalin as I had nothing else to only for the children.”  
     
      
    71 Later she was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: You see [the appellant] wasn’t a violent man was he? 
         
        A: I beg your pardon. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: [The appellant] was not a violent man? 
         
        A: I still – I couldn’t understand. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: [The appellant] was not a violent man? 
         
        A: Yes he was a violent man.” 
        
       
      
    72 Somewhat surprisingly, defence counsel raised the issue of the appellant fracturing MW’s nose. Counsel suggested to MW that the appellant never did that to which she replied, “That’s not correct.” The following exchange then occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: I put it to you that he never struck you ever? 
         
        A: Yes he did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You only told the police about the instance where you say your nose was broken only last Friday didn’t you? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You see [the appellant] was quite a strict disciplinarian in the house with the children wasn’t he? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And he was sometimes cranky? 
         
        A: Well most of the time yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: But the administering of corporal punishment was such that it was you who administered the punishment to the girls? 
         
        A: That is not true. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And it was [the appellant] who administered the punishment to the boys? 
         
        A: Yes he did but – he did belt DR. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And he did use a strap or belt? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: To administer discipline to the boys? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: That was in the nature of using the belt around the backside or the back of the legs? 
         
        A: (no verbal reply).” 
        
       
       
      The evidence of MW’s adopted son DR 
       
      
    73 DR also gave evidence. He was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: What do you say about [the appellant’s] personality and how did he treat you? 
         
        A Not very good. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Can you tell us what he did? 
         
        A: Got a lot of beltings when I was young. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: How often would you get a belting? 
         
        A: I can’t recall. It was quite often though. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What sort of beltings – what would you have done to cause you to be belted? 
         
        A: Maybe misbehaved, woke him up from his shift work or something like that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: These beltings could you describe what they were like? 
         
        A: With a lot of force. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What was used? 
         
        A: A leather belt. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Was it doubled over? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Where were you struck? 
         
        A: Backside and the legs from what I recall. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What sort of force was used? 
         
        A: Quite a bit, a lot of anger put behind it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: How was the belt raised? 
         
        A: Well I guess behind your head. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: So he had his hand you say level with your head you just indicated? 
         
        A: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Like that? 
         
        A: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Can you just show the jury how he-- 
         
        A: He’d probably bring his arm way back. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And bring it down upon-- 
         
        A: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: How was the belt, I think you said it was doubled? 
         
        A: Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: The buckle part of it was where? 
         
        A: He’d be holding that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: How wide was the leather belt? 
         
        A: Probably about two-and-a-half inches wide. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did it hurt? 
         
        A: Oh my word. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Sorry? 
         
        A: My word. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Leave any marks? 
         
        A: Yes it would for a while yeah.” 
        
       
      
    74 He was asked about the occasion when he ran away from home. He said this occurred when he had an argument with his mother during which he said the appellant “got out of bed and chased me up the road and I never went back home for quite a while.” He said that he stayed at a friend’s place for about 2 weeks. He was ultimately located by the police and returned to his home. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s denial 
       
      
    75 The appellant gave evidence at his trial. He denied engaging in any sexual misconduct with his stepdaughters. He denied purchasing or possessing Vaseline, buying the complainants special gifts or any of the specific sexual acts which he was alleged to have committed. 
     
      
    76 He accepted that he “administered the discipline” to the boys but denied that he ever administered it to the girls. He said “I’ve never hit them girls in my life.” 
     
      
    77 He said that it was the function of MW to discipline the girls although he was responsible for disciplining the boys. 
     
      
    78 With respect to the boys he said that he used the hand or the strap on the backside. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of SR 
       
      
    79 Evidence was also given by SR who was called by the appellant. He said that when the children were in trouble punishment was administered by both MW and the appellant. He said that the appellant used a “leather strap on us” and his mother used an implement which was “like curtain rod out of a tall clothes dryer, the old clothes dryers that had curtain rods hanging in them to hang the clothes on.” 
     
      
    80 He said that he never saw the appellant using the rod and did not remember either his mother or the appellant hitting the girls with the rod or the belt. He said that the appellant would use a belt and hit him on “the bum or back of the legs.” He gave a detailed account of how the appellant would use the belt. 
     
      
    81 The appellant initially filed two grounds of appeal. During the hearing the court granted leave to the appellant to file a third ground. The grounds of appeal are accordingly as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. The trial judge erred by admitting evidence of violence on the part of the appellant. 
       
       
      2. The directions concerning evidence of violence on the part of the appellant was inadequate. 
       
       
      3. The trial miscarried because the Crown Prosecutor’s address invited the jury to use the evidence of violence for impermissible purposes.  
       
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    82 As I have previously discussed, the appellant objected to the tender of evidence concerning the violent behaviour of the appellant. The issue was raised before the jury was empanelled. When the appellant emphasised that the evidence did not suggest that any of the sexual acts were committed in response to threats or actual violence on the part of the appellant, the Crown submitted that it should nevertheless be admitted because it explained the complainants’ acquiescence and failure to complain to their mother. Furthermore, it was submitted that it was relevant to the issue of lack of consent, an essential element in count 11. The trial judge effectively accepted the Crown’s submission. 
     
      
    83 The appellant contends that it was erroneous to admit the evidence which has occasioned a miscarriage of justice. The submission on appeal was far more sophisticated than the argument put to the trial judge. Furthermore, contrary to the expectation of the Prosecutor, the complainants did not give evidence that they had acquiesced in the alleged sexual acts because of the appellant’s violence or threats of violence. They did say that the appellant was a violent man and gave a detailed account of some of his actions. The image portrayed by them and other Crown witnesses was of a man given to anger, flogging the children with a strap and belting them, leaving welts on their legs. He was portrayed as a lazy man and a heavy drinker. SK said she was terrified of him. 
     
      
    84 Counsel for the appellant emphasised that the complainants did not give evidence that they were threatened with violence if they did not comply with the appellant’s demands. Furthermore, defence counsel at the trial did not challenge the credibility of the complainants to suggest that they acquiesced in performing sexual acts or because they failed to complain to their mother at the time the offences were allegedly committed. 
     
      
    85 The appellant submitted that the evidence of the appellant’s alleged violence was inadmissible because it offended the credibility rule and did not fall within the exception to that rule of re-establishing credibility (s 102 and s 108 of the Evidence Act). It was further submitted that by reason of its lack of probative value and unfair prejudice it should have been excluded pursuant to s 137 of the Act. 
     
      
    86 Unless otherwise excluded, evidence that is relevant is admissible in a criminal trial (s 56 of the Evidence Act). Evidence that is relevant is evidence which could rationally affect, directly or indirectly the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue (s 55(1)). Evidence is not irrelevant only because it relates to the credibility of a witness (s 51(2)). 
     
      
    87 In the present case, proof of each of the counts required the Crown to establish a discrete set of facts relating to the conduct of the appellant concerning his sexual relations with the complainants. The evidence indicated that in relation to some of the counts, the appellant was physically overbearing or put the complainant in fear although this was not so in relation to each count. 
     
      
    88 Evidence which has the effect of explaining the actions or lack of action of a complainant who is confronted by another person intent upon some form of sexual assault has been admitted in trials, although not without controversy and difficulty. As the different judgments in HML v R [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 235 CLR 334 made plain, the controversies have proved difficult to resolve and guiding principles difficult to develop. When the evidence is tendered for the purpose of establishing the context in which the charged acts occurred, it is necessary to consider whether the evidence bears upon the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue, whether it is relevant only to the credit of a witness, or whether, although otherwise admissible, it should be excluded because of the danger of unfair prejudice. Each of these questions can occasion difficulty in a particular case. 
     
      
    89 In many cases the issue of concern will be whether evidence of other sexual misconduct by an offender should be admitted at his trial for particular offences. In HML Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ remarked that such evidence may be admissible for the purpose of showing that an accused had a sexual interest in a complainant or that an accused was disposed to carrying out sexual assaults against a complainant (per Hayne J at [109], [234]). 
     
      
    90 Evidence of the physical events which are said to constitute an alleged crime will always be admissible in evidence. Where a sexual assault is alleged, evidence of the relevant physical events will be admissible. In most cases, that evidence will be confined to evidence given by the complainants where the allegation might otherwise appear to come “out of the blue” (R v GAE (2000) 1 VR 198 at 206; Tully v R (2006) 230 CLR 234 at 278). Where the complainant’s credit is attacked for failing to make a contemporaneous complaint, evidence of a pre-existing relationship, including evidence of previous sexual relations between the accused and the complainant is, subject to discretionary issues, admissible as evidence relevant to an issue in the trial. Such evidence may also be relevant where it is accepted that the relevant physical act occurred but the issue is whether the complainant consented. It will provide a context in which the complainant’s evidence can be appropriately evaluated. It may be the case that the evidence supports the complainant’s credit, it may achieve the contrary, or it may assist the finder of fact to conclude that the disputed event did or did not happen. 
     
      
    91 In HML, Heydon J at [272] drew upon the writings of the Roman-Dutch scholar Matthaeus who described a presumption of fact as “nothing other than an inference of common sense, based upon what usually happens or is presumed to happen.” In many cases, in order to reach a conclusion about whether a particular act happened, the context in which that act is said to have occurred will be of assistance to the decision maker. Accordingly, if there is a history of sexual misconduct by an accused with the complainant, common sense would suggest that it is more likely that a particular event, even if not precisely recalled by a complainant, will have occurred. Where in a trial for murder the issue was whether the accused discharged the gun by accident, evidence of a pre-existing enmity between the parties would, as a matter of common sense, suggest that the shooting was deliberate rather than an accident. This was the situation in Wilson v The Queen (1970) 123 CLR 334. 
     
      
    92 The admissibility of tendency evidence is controlled by s 97 of the Act. The evidence will be relevant to prove that an accused had a tendency to act in a particular way or have a particular state of mind. It may be that there is evidence that an accused had previously sexually assaulted the complainant or, in similar circumstances to the act charged, has assaulted another person. The former may contribute to an understanding of the context in which the charged act occurred. The latter, of course, will not. If tendered as evidence of the context it is admissible because it enables the finder of fact to better appreciate the true relationship between the parties allowing the complainant’s and/or the accused’s evidence to be seen in context. It does not, in the same manner as tendency evidence would do, directly inform a judgment as to whether the offence with which an accused has been charged actually occurred. 
     
      
    93 In the present case, both complainants gave evidence of repeated sexual acts committed on them by the appellant. On occasion their evidence indicated that they were “scared or terrified.” On occasion their evidence indicated that they did not want to engage in sexual activity but being scared of the appellant felt unable to resist. KG said that on one occasion she decided to report the events to her mother but out of a concern as to any response from the appellant decided to remain silent.  
     
      
    94 In September 1980 the appellant again took KG to a physiotherapy appointment. They returned home at about 11.30 am. The appellant allegedly told KG to undress and to put on lingerie. KG told the appellant, “I didn’t want to do anything.” The appellant said, “Come you’re going into the bedroom.” KG said that she complied because she was scared of the appellant. The appellant allegedly took pornographic photos of KG, including photos of KG performing fellatio on him for four to five minutes (count six). The appellant allegedly applied Vaseline to KG’s vagina and had penile-vaginal intercourse with her from behind and ejaculated inside her (count eight). He also performed cunnilingus on KG (count seven). KG said that she felt “scared, emotional – I just didn’t want to be there.” KG gave evidence that the appellant “actually made the threat that it wasn’t to be told to anyone.” 
     
      
    95 In February to March 1982, while KG’s mother was in hospital, the appellant allegedly engaged in nightly sexual activity with the complainant. On one occasion the appellant allegedly undressed KG, took pornographic photos of her, engaged in fellatio and cunnilingus, applied Vaseline and had penile-vaginal intercourse with KG from behind (count nine) and then from on top while KG lay on her back (count ten). The appellant allegedly withdrew his penis and ejaculated over KG’s stomach. KG gave evidence that after this incident she “made a decision to tell mum” but then “talked myself out of it … I was scared of what he would do to me.” 
     
      
    96 Count eleven was the only offence that required proof of absence of consent. DR ran away from home sometime in 1982. This occurred following an altercation which culminated in DR pushing MW to the ground. KG gave evidence that the appellant took her with him in the car to look for DR in the area known as the Vale of Clwydd. The appellant parked the car in a “protected area” off the road. He allegedly asked for oral sex. “I told him again I didn’t want to do anything.” The appellant replied, “You’re going to do it.” KG said in evidence, “I didn’t believe I had a choice.” KG performed fellatio on the appellant until she tasted ”pre-ejaculate” (count eleven). The appellant then allegedly had penile-vaginal intercourse with KG from behind while she leaned over the boot of the car (count twelve). 
     
      
    97 SK gave evidence of a similar progression from “cuddling” under the kangaroo skin rug on the lounge to touching over and then under her nightdress and underpants to digital penetration. SK also complained that the appellant gave her “adult kisses.” She recalled receiving a Polaroid camera and signet ring as special gifts. 
     
      
    98 While SK was in year three at school, the appellant allegedly digitally penetrated SK’s vagina while they were lying on the lounge under the kangaroo rug. When this happened, the appellant said, “Just relax. Do you like it? You’ll enjoy it.” SK gave evidence that she was “terrified” and didn’t know what to say – “So I never said anything.” 
     
      
    99 To my mind, evidence of violence perpetrated by the appellant against the complainants was relevant because it provided a realistic context in which to understand the complainants’ evidence. Evidence that a complainant did not resist the appellant or report the assaults to her mother because she believed it to be pointless to resist or was scared or terrified of the appellant’s possible response demands an understanding of the context of the prior relationship between the complainant and the appellant. If the relationship is one where the appellant has been violent to the complainant or, to the knowledge of the complainant by his dealings with others, has demonstrated a preparedness to use violence or put others in fear, that event, which places the alleged offences in a realistic context, must be admissible when given by a complainant. However, it may be otherwise if given by a third party. 
     
      
    100 In Wilson, evidence of the relationship between the accused and the deceased was admissible to inform the issue of accident. As is obvious, that evidence could come from third parties. However, it was not evidence of a tendency or propensity of the accused to shoot people; it merely provided a realistic context within which to understand the charged act. In the present case, evidence of the appellant’s propensity to inflict violence upon third parties ie persons other than the complainants was only relevant if it provided evidence of the context in which the appellant allegedly acted and the response of the complainants to his actions. Whether or not the appellant was otherwise a person given to violence was not relevant. 
     
      
    101 The appellant submitted that because the evidence originally anticipated by the Prosecutor did not eventuate, the trial miscarried. His counsel emphasised the fact that the defence did not challenge the credibility of the complainants because of their acquiescence or failure to complain. To my mind these submissions cannot be accepted. Although this evidence or the suggested challenge was not forthcoming, it was nevertheless relevant for the jury to appreciate the nature of the “relationship” between the complainants and the appellant. It would be obvious that any person would question why the complainants did not resist or complain about the appellant’s actions. That issue was capable of being informed by a knowledge of the appellant’s propensity for violence directed at the complainants. As my discussion of their evidence indicates the circumstances of various of the offences were inextricably bound up with acts of violence, or at least, the threat of violence by the appellant. 
     
      
    102 Subject to discretionary issues, this analysis makes admissible the evidence of the appellant’s violent conduct given by the complainants. However, I believe that it was otherwise with respect to the evidence of MW or DR, of acts of violence committed on them when the complainants were not present. This evidence confirmed a tendency for violence on the part of the appellant but to my mind was not admissible as evidence of the context in which the alleged offences occurred. 
     
      
       
      Exclusion under s 137 
       
      
    103 The appellant submitted that the evidence of violence should have been excluded pursuant to s 137. It was submitted that because no challenge was made by the defence on the basis of the complainants’ failure to complain or their acquiescence, the evidence was of only slight probative value. 
     
      
    104 The unfair prejudice occasioned to the appellant was described as grave. A number of aspects were identified. The appellant was presented as a persistent and brutal child and wife beater. This irremediably blackened his character. Secondly, it was submitted that it created a false issue requiring the appellant to defend his character against ill-defined and non-specific allegations. It was further submitted that the appellant was presented with the difficulty of the opening remarks by the Prosecutor suggesting evidence of threats of violence by the appellant towards the complainants and evidence relating to MW’s broken nose. The appellant submitted that the admission of the evidence of violence introduced the very real danger of its misuse by the jury. Reference was made to the observation by Gleeson CJ in HML at [12] that “the risk that evidence of propensity will be taken by the jury to prove too much.” The risk was said to be that the jury would impermissibly reason that the appellant’s disposition or tendency to engage in violent or discreditable conduct meant that it was likely, or more likely, that the appellant committed the offences for which he was being tried. It was submitted that the Prosecutor’s closing address which characterised the charged sexual acts as a continuation or progression of the acts of violence effectively invited the jury to engage in this mode of reasoning.  
     
      
    105 Finally, it was submitted that a discrete form of unfairness arose because the evidence of violence given by the complainants was corroborated by other prosecution witnesses. This created the possibility that the jury would erroneously consider corroboration of the appellant’s violence as corroboration of the charged acts (see Hodgson JA in Leonard v R (2006) 164 A Crim R 374 at 388 [54]-[58]). It was said that this gave the prosecution case a persuasive force which it did not have. For these reasons it was submitted that the trial judge’s discretion to admit the evidence miscarried: House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; Smale v R (2007) NSWCCA 328 at [32]. 
     
      
    106 It was further submitted that even if admitted, it may have been possible for his Honour to have limited the use to which the evidence could be put, thereby ameliorating any prejudice. In particular it was suggested that the evidence could have been limited to identifying the fears the complainants held (not the basis for the fears) and it could have been required to be given in general rather than specific terms. 
     
      
    107 As I have previously indicated, in my view, the evidence of the appellant’s violence given by MW and DR should have been rejected. However, the situation is otherwise with respect to the evidence of the complainants. Given the nature of the charges, involving, as at least some counts did, the appellant imposing his will on the complainants, a real appreciation of the circumstances of each offence required an understanding of the appellant’s general behaviour relating to the complainants. It was never suggested and of course could not have been suggested that because the appellant was a person given to violence he was necessarily a person given to sexual assaults. This was not a case as was recognised in HML when similar fact evidence could distort or overwhelm a jury’s consideration of the facts relevant to the elements of each of the counts. There was no difficulty for the appellant in challenging the evidence of violence which he did, both by his own evidence and through the evidence of others. Although the evidence was obviously prejudicial to the appellant that prejudice was not unfair in the relevant sense. Section 137 did not require the exclusion of the evidence of the complainants with respect to the appellant’s violent behaviour toward them.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    108 As I have previously indicated the trial judge addressed the evidence of the appellant’s violence during the course of the trial. At the conclusion of the evidence of KG his Honour spoke to the jury about the relevance of the evidence of the appellant’s violence and the assault of KB. I have set out his Honour’s direction at [115]. 
     
      
    109 The Prosecutor then raised the issue of violence in his final address. A lengthy submission was made in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Then comes the other aspect of his behaviour with these children. The question of his violence and his anger. Can you imagine how confused and bewildered these girls would be. Here he is coming into the household as a family figure, changing their names by deed poll, playing, giving them treats and then there’s this violence. This violence that every member of the family, every child is a recipient of. 
        
       
       
        
        KB told you that he’d belt you with a leather strap for the slightest indiscretion. If you answered back or drop a plate being an example, Back of the legs, backside with – and also on the hand. She tells you that she saw it, the beltings of D and she told you that it was not so much on S. And you recall the strap hanging over the coathanger in exhibit C, the photograph of the bedroom. Even the accused said yes that looks like and possibly was one of the belts that he used. And we all – it’s common knowledge or commonly accepted that D ran away because he was terrified. He was terrified and he hid. You recall what D told you about Sussex Inlet when S dobbed him in for smoking. He was confined to his room for a week. And D also recalls that the accused use to lie on the lounge with K. 
        
       
       
        
        You see D demonstrated by showing you how he was belted with this strap. The accused had it doubled over. He had his hand around the buckle and he raised his arm above his head. 
        
       
       
        
        And you recall S came along. He demonstrated you might think how, exactly how the accused demonstrated how he was belted but S went a bit further than that. Immediately after and without any prompting and without question about it immediately after he said, ‘But it wasn’t above his head’. So it’s a matter for you what weight you put on S’s evidence as to that. It might well be that S was still trying to be his favourite. 
        
       
       
        
        You see both D and S gave evidence of a falling out with their mother and their sisters. And the difference being is that S thinks the accused was a normal father and everybody else in the family knows the truth about it. 
        
       
       
        
        In cross-examination the accused was asked this, words to this effect, ‘Where would you go to get a belt to discipline them? Where would you go to get a belt to discipline them?’ His answer was, ‘If there was a belt it could’ve been on the lounge or hanging on a door knob. If no belt used his hand.’ Well there’s two other witnesses to say that it was readily available on this door knob. M and K. 
        
       
       
        
        K tells you that he was always cranky, shouting, throwing things around, driving off in a temper she described as a hoon. She tells you how her mother was treated and her words are that ‘She was treated like a doormat.’ Had to do what he told her. She had no confidence. This is K telling you how her mother was treated. She had no confidence. She had several breakdowns. 
        
       
       
        
        And M told you this, MW, he is very domineering, demoralising. She had mental stress, breakdowns, periods in hospital. ‘He took, my self esteem away.’ And she was asked in cross-examination words to the effect, ‘Did you ever ask K about these special gifts?’ and her response was this, ‘I wouldn’t in a frame of mind to do that. Downgraded, abused, drained of self respect. I was just an empty shell. I would get abused if asked him about the special gifts’, so she said that if she questioned him about those special gifts he was of such a nature and such a character that he would abuse her. 
        
       
       
        
        S says regarding the violence, ‘He would strike out at us when mother’s not there. He’d cane us with the dowel’ and recall the doweling coming from that old drier that you hang your clothes on. Apparently there’s a fan that blows hot air up through the clothes. 
        
       
       
        
        She recalled one time that they were all lined up. He accused them of doing something and she and D stepped forward at the same time and they both got caned. And if you flinched you’d get another one. 
        
       
       
        
        She tells you that she – this is S – was terrified of him. She recalls on one occasion that she ran into her bedroom, got under the bed, hid behind some toy boxes for two hours waiting for her mother to come home. She wet her panties. This accused instilled fear into these children. He broke their spirit and how could they cope with this in their minds. That is the conclusion about the niceness, the violence and then at a later time the acts, essential acts are also acts of violence. Exhibit B, this group photo, S is about five. There’s S. And K was about seven or eight. It wasn’t until a year or so later before S started to get abused but at this time the accused was penetrating the vagina of this girl K with his fingers. 
        
       
       
        
        M says that he used to – she seen him discipline D. He’d belt him if he back chatted. She told you about the force. That it was a hard force via the belt or the doweling rod. She told you that the belt was kept on the door handle going into the lounge room and the accused, as I’ve read out to you what he said in relation to it that it could’ve been on the door handle ready there as an intimidating threat on these children.” 
        
       
      
    110 Later he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “And you recall that K gave evidence that she was going to tell her mum who was in hospital. She got up that morning and made her way to the hospital area and she said – she tells you that she talked herself out of it and why did she talk herself out of it? Because she was scared and she did not know what he would do to her. 
        
       
       
        
        This is the man that has demonstrated violence to the girls and to D in front of them. See he flogged D to such an extent that he’d run and hide down at his friends at the Vale of Clwydd and these acts, sexual acts they were also violence penetrated upon a fourteen year old girl.” 
        
       
      
    111 Later, when summarising the sequence of events the Prosecutor referred to “the beltings. The introduction of violence into it. These girls would’ve been so bewildered and confused, scared and threatened. He eventually broke their spirits …” 
     
      
    112 Defence counsel also addressed the issue with the jury. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Let’s just have a look at this, there’s something mysterious about this case isn’t there. There’s something mysterious about the main prosecution witnesses. Are those prosecution witnesses K, S, M, D are they so truthful that on their evidence you could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. They paint a picture of this man as a lazy, a heavy drinker, person who wouldn’t work, violent, cruel, child sexual molester, that’s the picture they paint in one way or another. And then how do you reconcile that evidence with the evidence of SR, SGS, and RN. You see someone’s not telling the truth, And it’s interesting that the people SR, SGS and RN don’t have the bitterness or the resentment towards this man, that those other witnesses have. You see isn’t the situation that the evidence and the attitude of K, S, M and D is poisoned with bitterness towards the accused. How impartially and fairly have they given their evidence.” 
        
       
      
    113 Later when speaking of the evidence of SK he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “What about S, well one thing that might stand out from your commonsense and experience of life that despite the sexual misconduct by the accused towards her she still manages to become dux of the class. You might expect in the normal course of things with something like this, that her school performance would deteriorate. And what about the things that she says, she’s a great exaggerator S, if you examine her evidence she is a great exaggerator. For instance, ‘I always used to try and put myself to bed before it was even dark to avoid it’ imagine that, imagine that. This is this young girl, ‘I always used to try and put myself to bed before it was even dark to avoid it’ no one else says it. And she was asked a question by the prosecutor, if you did something wrong – it was about when she went into the bedroom and this is what her answer was ‘I ran to the room, I hid underneath the bed behind the toys and boxes was there for two hours until mum got home that terrified that I wet myself.’ If you analyse her evidence it’s melodramatic, and it’s riddled exaggeration. 
        
       
       
        
        Look at the words she used in the witness box. She talked about K being quite a nice bloke in the beginning, then she says he grew into a violent, lazy man, he was always off work us kids would have to do a lot of work around the house, we would have to do the housework, he would just lay around usually all the time, the kangaroo rug was there, he would strike out, violently abuse us, belt us whenever he could, if you flinched you got another strike of the wooden dowel. She used the words anger, terrified, flogged D. She was asked in relation to the flogging of DR, With what force? This is what she said ‘Violently extreme force left welts.’ She talked about a passionate kiss, the breaking of the lamp at Sussex Inlet, ‘I went running back to the cabin to mum terrified because I knew I would get into really big trouble’ but there’s no evidence she got into any big trouble. Look at her evidence melodramatic, exaggerated, over the top. Yet the prosecution says be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of her evidence about the guilt of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    114 Defence counsel also reminded the jury of the evidence favourable to the appellant. This included SR’s evidence that the appellant used a leather strap to discipline the boys; that it was MW who used the cane; that he never saw the appellant hitting the girls; that the appellant was employed and did the housework; that the appellant rarely drank alcohol in the house; and that he could not recall the girls receiving special gifts. SR denied that the appellant was violent, cruel or lazy. 
     
      
    115 In his summing-up, the trial judge gave the jury directions relating to the delay in complaint. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now the Crown case is that you would accept that both KG and Ms K made no immediate complaint about what she said the accused was doing to her because she was in fear of the accused. You have heard a lot of evidence in the Crown case abut the type of discipline the accused administered within the family and you have also heard some evidence how the accused behaved towards the child’s mother. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown says the complainants thus had a perception of the accused as a man who was easily angered and who would be violent and this is why they felt they could not do anything to stop what he was doing or to complain about it. 
        
       
       
        
        A specific example the Crown Prosecutor referred to was the evidence given by KG that the morning after the accused committed the acts that are relied upon for counts nine and ten she got up early, made the decision to tell her mother and walked to the hospital but by the time she got there she had talked herself out of it because she was scared of what the accused would do to her. 
        
       
       
        
        Now the defence case has presented an alternative version of events. The accused denied that he was any way overly angry let alone violent with anyone. The discipline he said he administered was moderate and only when called for and only in relation to the boys. Ms RN, his former wife, said he was not an angry or violent man. SS, his sister, described him in the same way. SR said the accused was not violent or cruel and he, S, described the manner in which the accused used the belt and I have referred to the demonstrations that were given to you.” 
        
       
      
    116 Early in the summing-up his Honour reminded the jury of the evidence of the appellant’s character. His Honour reminded the jury that there was evidence of the appellant’s propensity for violence but said that he would not go into the detail. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The next direction I must give you concerns some evidence about the character of the accused. There was evidence from Detective Sinton when he was being cross-examined by Mr Walsh that the accused has no criminal convictions for assault or sexual assault. Then there was evidence from Ms SS, the former sister in law of the accused, that in the period of time in which her family had contact with the accused and his wife, RN, she had no concerns about the accused in relation to her daughters of a sexual nature. It is a matter for you what you make of that broad statement. She was not asked about the type of contact he had with those daughters except that it was on occasions when the families visited each other’s home when adults were present. Ms N, who was called by the Crown, said that the accused was not a violent man; he was not lazy, he was not a heavy drinker of alcohol. She said he was always happy go lucky and did not easily get angry. She saw him in the company of the children in her family and she said he related well to them. Despite the fact that she lived in Lithgow and the accused had for some time lived in Ballina, she said that they had retained their friendship and she was supportive of him in relation to the allegations that are subject of this trial. SR described the accused as easy going. He said he was not a bad person, he said ‘He was always good to us, Mum and the four children.’ He said the accused was not violent or cruel. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Walsh has argued that you would take this evidence into account as establishing those specific aspects of the character of the accused. In the Crown case, however, there is evidence that conflicts with the evidence I have just been referring to. I do not propose to go through the detail of it but I am referring to the evidence by the two complainants, Ms G and Ms K and MW and DR about the accused they say being a violent and domineering type of person who had them living in fear. Now it is a matter for you whether you accept the evidence in the defence version of it about the character of the accused. If you do, then the law is that the accused is entitled to have you take this evidence into account in a particular way and that is that the fact that he is a man of that type of character entitles you to consider the improbability of him having committed the offences alleged. In other words, you are entitled to take this aspect of the character of the accused into account on the question of his guilt. This does not mean of course that this provides him with some kind of a defence; it is only one of the many factors that you must take into account in determining whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt.” 
        
       
      
    117 The appellant submitted that the trial judge’s directions were inadequate. It was submitted, relying upon R v JDK [2009] NSWCCA 76 that the jury should have been directed both at the time the evidence was given and in the summing up of the confined use which could be made of the evidence. This meant that the jury should have been told in clear terms that the evidence was tendered in order to provide background to the relationship so that the evidence of the complainant and her response to the alleged acts of the accused could be evaluated with a complete understanding of that alleged relationship. It was further submitted that the jury should have been told that they could not use the evidence as tendency evidence. 
     
      
    118 The appellant’s submission reflects a misunderstanding of my remarks in JDK which was concerned with other actions by an accused of a sexual nature involving the complainant, referred to in HML as “uncharged acts.” The appellant refers to uncharged acts or discreditable conduct, presumably a reference to Hayne J in HML. 
     
      
    119 Although violence is plainly discreditable, it is not the kind of evidence or conduct which Hayne J had in mind. The purpose of its tender was to put the allegation in context but it provided evidence of quite a different character to the substantive allegations. 
     
      
    120 In the present case, although the evidence of the appellant’s violence provided the jury with information about the context in which the crimes allegedly occurred, its primary relevance was to explain the complainants’ apparent acquiescence and failure to report the events when they happened. Although his Honour directed the jury as to the purpose of the evidence at the conclusion of KG’s evidence, he did not otherwise refer to the issue until the summing up. Although he could have done so, I do not believe it was necessary. Having had the purpose of the evidence explained to them after KG’s evidence I am in no doubt that the jury would have readily understood the purpose for which similar evidence from the other witnesses was admitted. 
     
      
    121 I have set out above the directions which the trial judge gave in his summing up. They were consistent with the purpose for which the evidence was admitted and did not elevate the evidence beyond its appropriate significance in the trial. Trial counsel raised no issue with respect to the directions and rule 4 applies. There being no arguable error I would decline leave to raise this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    122 Under this ground the appellant’s primary submission was that the Crown Prosecutor sought to “collapse the boundaries between the appellant’s violent conduct and the charged sexual acts” and invited the jury to engage in impermissible tendency reasoning. It was submitted that in his address to the jury the Prosecutor invited the jury to reason that because the appellant had a tendency to behave violently towards the step children, it was inherently more likely that he had engaged in the culpable sexual acts which were merely another form of violent conduct. 
     
      
    123 I have previously extracted the relevant passages from the Prosecutor’s address. There is no doubt that the Prosecutor emphasised the evidence of the appellant’s violent actions and emphasised the role that the violence would have played in subduing the children and putting them in fear. Although the language the Prosecutor used was strong, it was not inappropriate having regard to the evidence which had been admitted. The evidence justified a submission that the children were, because of the appellant’s use of violence, afraid of him, providing the context in which they became compliant of, and did not complain to others about, his sexual activities. 
     
      
    124 There are some difficulties created by the references to the manner in which the appellant treated MW. I have already indicated that in my opinion that evidence should have been excluded. It was not of direct relevance to the manner in which he treated the complainants nor did it explain their response to him. However, having regard to the force of the admissible evidence and the clear picture which it presented of the nature of the appellant’s treatment of the children I do not believe the evidence of his mistreatment of MW to have been significant to the jury’s verdict. It had the effect of reinforcing the jury’s image of the appellant as bad tempered, domineering, abusive and at times violent. However, that image was firmly established by the complainants’ evidence. I refer to this matter below. 
     
      
    125 The appellant emphasised that during discussion with the trial judge about the admissibility of the evidence of the breaking of MW’s nose his Honour pointed out that the Crown’s tendency notice did not include a tendency in the appellant to be violent. The tendency notice identified sexual intent but not violence. Accordingly, by associating the appellant’s alleged sexual acts with violence (effectively characterising them as acts of violence) it was submitted that the Prosecutor invited the jury to reason directly from the appellant’s violence to his guilt in relation to the sexual offences. 
     
      
    126 By making the submission which he did, it was submitted that the Prosecutor exceeded the boundaries permitted to a prosecutor, ie he made submissions based on material which was not in evidence and was guilty of intemperate or inflammatory comments tending to arouse prejudice or emotion in the jury: see R v Livermore (2006) 67 NSWLR 569 at [32]. Reliance was also placed on the approach of the Court of Appeal in Victoria in R v DDR [1998] 3 VR 380; (1997) 99 A Crim R 327 which set aside a conviction because accusations made by a prosecutor were said to have “been designed only to create prejudice in the jury against (the accused)” rather than provide a logical argument to support the prosecution case. 
     
      
    127 I am not persuaded that the submission should be accepted. It is not without significance that no application was made by trial counsel either for the discharge of the jury or requesting a direction from the trial judge to deal with the situation. This would suggest that the adverse impact now suggested to arise from the Prosecutor’s remarks may not have been the experience of those in the Court. 
     
      
    128 I have no hesitation in rejecting the submission that the Prosecutor’s remarks were not based upon the evidence. The submissions which were made were clearly open. The evidence disclosed a pattern of abuse commencing when the children were quite young and continuing as they grew older, ultimately extending to penile penetration. As the children grew older any inclination they had to resist or complain was understandably influenced by the appellant’s behaviour including the fear he created by reason of his violence towards them. 
     
      
       
      The proviso 
       
      
    129 The ultimate question is whether the admission of the evidence of the appellant’s threats or actual acts of violence perpetrated on other than the complainants and his allegedly abusive conduct in the family situation has occasioned a miscarriage of justice. I do not believe it has. 
     
      
    130 I have carefully reviewed the transcript of the evidence at the trial. Leaving aside the evidence which in my opinion should not have been admitted the evidence of the complainants and in particular their account of the relevant events is entirely convincing. Although the evidence of the appellant’s violent conduct towards others, particularly MW, would no doubt have adversely coloured the jury’s view of the appellant, I do not believe it would have caused the trial to miscarry or occasioned the appellant the loss of a chance of an acquittal. 
     
      
    131 In my judgment the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    132 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes, and, for the most part, with his reasons. I depart from the reasoning of his Honour in only the following limited respect. I do not share his Honour’s view that the evidence of violence on the part of the appellant given by the complainants’ mother, MW, and brother, DR, ought not to have been admitted. That requires some analysis of the course of the trial and the evidence. 
     
      
    133 The Crown served upon the solicitor for the appellant notices under s 97 and s 98 of the Evidence Act 1995, signalling its intention to call tendency and coincidence evidence. To the notices it annexed copies of statements of each complainant, and of MW and DR. The “tendency” identified in the s 97 notice was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The tendency [of the appellant] sought to be proved is his/her (sic) tendency to have a particular state of mind, namely an unusual sexual interest in his step-daughters who were of a young age and under his care, as evidenced by his acts.” 
        
       
       
      The notice went on to particularise facts and circumstances upon which the Crown relied. 
       
      
    134 One of these was: 
     
      
       
        
        “e. Both complainants allege that the accused made threats and was violent towards them. [KG] said that the accused told her not to tell anyone as it was their special time together. She also said that on one occasion the accused threatened to hit her if she did not submit to sexual intercourse with him. She was also afraid of what the accused would do to her if she told anyone what was happening. [SK] said that the accused would belt the kids all the time for very little reason when their mother was at work. She was extremely scared of the accused due to the violence and anger he would show towards her. On one occasions (sic) she hid from the accused under her bed for 2 hours until her mother came home. The accused would use a strap and flog the children regularly for almost anything. The accused’s act of penile/vaginal intercourse with her caused her to be absolutely petrified of him.” 
        
       
       
      In my opinion this reflects an imperfect appreciation of the nature of tendency evidence. It is difficult to see how evidence of violence of the kind referred to is capable of establishing “an unusual sexual interest” in the complainants. 
       
      
    135 The appellant’s legal representative filed a Notice of Motion seeking separate trials in respect of the allegations made by each complainant. This was supported by an affidavit affirmed by the appellant’s solicitor. 
     
      
    136 Before his Honour on that application were additional statements of the complainants, and the statements of the complainants’ mother and brother, and SK’s husband. The basis of the application was acknowledged to be “a real possibility of concoction” (AB 139). This was a reference to the decision of the High Court in Hoch v The Queen [1988] HCA 50; 165 CLR 292. Counsel for the appellant agreed that his “sole complaint” was “under s 101(2)” of the Evidence Act. A voir dire was conducted, in which each complainant, MW and DR gave evidence. Both MW and DR gave evidence of violence. 
     
      
    137 After hearing the evidence and argument, the trial judge rejected the appellant’s application for separate trials. He held that, as the evidence of each complainant would be admissible in the trial concerning the allegations of the other, there was no reason to order separate trials. In this judgment, and in the argument that preceded it, there was no reference to the evidence of violence. It is clear enough that the evidence of violence was not treated as tendency evidence. Defence counsel expressly acknowledged that the evidence did not support the contention that the evidence of either complainant was contaminated by concoction.  
     
      
    138 It was then that the issue of the evidence of violence was raised. Just what evidence was here under consideration was never stated with precision. The transcript records the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Just a question of contextual evidence your Honour I don’t think your Honour needs to make a formal ruling giving (sic) that -- 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: No. 
         
         
        [COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANT]: Well your Honour I’ll make a formal objection to the contextual relationship evidence, I’m aware what the law is -- 
         
         
        … Your Honour makes the ruling.” 
        
       
      
    139 His Honour then indicated that the “contextual evidence” would be admitted. Before he finished his remarks, counsel for the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The other matter, one matter that I wish to raise your Honour is this its, I’m seeking for the Crown not to lead evidence in relation to violence and I do so on this basis, that there is no suggestion that any of the sexual acts were committed in response to threats or violence and the violence that has been described in the court relates obviously to disciplinary sorts of matters and I object to the Crown leading evidence of violence.” 
        
       
      
    140 In response to an inquiry from his Honour, the transcript records that the Crown prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well at the time of the offences in particular count 1 and 2 that’s the Sussex Inlet matters, [KG], he said to her ‘do as you’re told or I will hurt you’. In count 3, at paragraphs 2 and page 3 to the end of paragraph 3 page 4, he said to her ‘don’t tell anyone it’s our secret’ threaten to hurt her if she did. Similarly, the incidents counts 11 and 12 … he did again threaten to hit her if she didn’t comply with what he wanted … and your Honour’s (sic) [SK] evidence that she was terrified or petrified of him to such an extent that she hid under the bed and wet her panties. There’s also the evidence of [KG] who observed that the violence towards – the result of the violence towards her mother blood all over, well blood in the bathroom and injuries to her face. So those episodes of violence are intertwined with the niceness, the grooming and it’s significant in the sense that these, will be alleged that these children at the time eight, nine, 10 were afraid of him and were confused as to the periods of niceness, the grooming if we could put in that aspect and didn’t tell anyone because of his violence within the family and there is evidence that they were aware of his violence towards [DR], causing [DR] to go away, run away …” 
        
       
      
    141 At no time was there any attempt to differentiate between evidence of violence towards the complainants, or violence towards others in their presence, or to their knowledge, and evidence of violence otherwise. 
     
      
    142 It is important to note that the evidence now under consideration, that is evidence of violence unrelated to sexual molestation of either complainant, although the subject of the tendency notice, is not, and was not tendered as, tendency evidence. The appellation given to it was “context evidence” or “contextual evidence”, appellations commonly used and understood. It was not evidence of the kind the subject of the seven separate judgments in HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; 235 CLR 334. That evidence, as outlined by Heydon J, was evidence of sexual misconduct of a kind similar to that the subject of the charges, or evidence signifying a sexual interest in the complainants: see Heydon J at [256], [356]. Gleeson CJ opened his judgment by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “[1] These matters raise issues concerning the admissibility at a criminal trial of a certain kind of similar fact evidence …” 
        
       
      
    143 It is necessary properly to characterise the evidence of violence towards MW and DR, in the absence of the complainants. In part, it fits within the description “context” evidence: it helps to depict the context in which the conduct the subject of the charges took place. 
     
      
    144 But it did more than that. A recurring theme throughout the evidence of the two complainants was that they did not disclose the appellant’s conduct to their mother, or to anybody else, because they were in fear of the appellant. KG said that, on one occasion, she had resolved to tell her mother (who was at that time in hospital) but that, by the time she arrived at the hospital “I’d talked myself out of it”. This was because “I was scared of what he would do to me”. She also said, in respect of one of the incidents (AB 226) that she told the appellant that she did not want to engage in oral sex, which he was demanding, but that he ordered her to do so, and “I didn’t believe I had a choice”. 
     
      
    145 In HML, Gleeson CJ pointed out: 
     
      
       
        
        “Jurors are told that, in evaluating evidence, they should use their common sense and their experience of life.” 
        
       
      
    146 Trial and appellate judges are distressingly familiar with evidence of this kind. But it may be supposed (and hoped) that many, if not most, members of juries will not have been exposed to conduct of the kind here in question. It is, it may be supposed, entirely alien to, and well outside the “experience of life” of the vast majority of members of the community who are required to serve on juries. It may be difficult for those individuals to understand that two young sisters, repeatedly sexually molested by their step-father, did not feel able to tell their mother of that conduct, and continued, however unwillingly, to acquiesce in it.  
     
      
    147 The evidence of the appellant’s violence was powerful evidence in support of what may otherwise have seemed to a jury to be unlikely. It explains what may otherwise not be apparent to a jury. That was the approach taken by Gleeson CJ to what he called “similar fact evidence” in HML. 
     
      
    148 I agree with McClellan CJ at CL that the evidence of violence towards the complainants was admissible, as was evidence of violence to others committed in their presence.  
     
      
    149 I see no reason to treat the evidence of violence towards MW or DR differently to evidence of violence towards the complainants. I am not attracted by the proposition that, unless the complainants were aware of the specific instances the subject of the evidence of MW and DR, it should not have been admitted. The issue was whether, as they said, the complainants either acquiesced, or did not complain, because of their fear of the appellant, stemming from his violence. The fact of his violence, even if some instances of it were unknown to the complainants, was a relevant strand in establishing that part of the Crown case. 
     
      
    150 With those reservations, I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.  
     
      
    151 FULLERTON J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: By an Amended Summons filed 2 September 2010, the Plaintiff, the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), seeks relief in respect of the dismissal by a Magistrate at the Parramatta Local Court on 7 October 2009 of charges laid against the First Defendant, Basame Chaouk, of affray and being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence.  
     
      
    2 The Plaintiff seeks declaratory and prerogative relief and, in the alternative, an order under s.59(2)(a) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 setting aside orders made on 7 October 2009 and remitting the proceedings to the Parramatta Local Court to be heard and determined according to law. 
     
      
    3 At the hearing of the Amended Summons on 26 November 2010, Mr Bourke of counsel appeared for the Plaintiff. The First Defendant appeared unrepresented. A submitting appearance had been filed on behalf of the Second Defendant, the Local Court of New South Wales. The First Defendant had been unrepresented when the matter came before Price J for hearing on 6 August 2010, with an adjournment being granted to him to seek legal representation. On 26 November 2010, the First Defendant was still unrepresented and the matter proceeded to hearing. 
     
      
       
      Factual Background 
       
       
      The Incident on 16 January 2009 
       
      
    4 As at January 2009, the First Defendant and Shane Towney had been neighbours for approximately two years, residing in a street in Granville. Mr Towney lived directly across the road from the First Defendant. The relationship between them was characterised by much animosity.  
     
      
    5 About 11.40 am on 16 January 2009, the First Defendant arrived home. At the time, Mr Towney was placing his council bin at the front of his premises across the road. It is alleged that the First Defendant looked at Mr Towney and said words to the effect of “What are you doing, fat boy?” An argument then ensued with both hurling abuse at one another. Both remained on opposing sides of the street. However, the argument became increasingly heated, with the First Defendant yelling “I’m gunna fix you”.  
     
      
    6 It is alleged that the First Defendant went inside his house for a short time and Mr Towney remained on the other side of the street. The First Defendant then returned, brandishing a silver knife with a 15 centimetre fold-out blade, which he was carrying in his right hand. It is alleged that he stormed across the street towards Mr Towney, who saw the knife upon approach, but stood his ground. The First Defendant is alleged to have approached Mr Towney, raised his right hand and jabbed Mr Towney to the upper-left cheek with the knife in hand. This action caused Mr Towney immediate pain and opened an eight centimetre abrasion to his upper-left cheek. It is alleged that Mr Towney then said to one of his young children, who was present throughout, “Go and get me a knife”. 
     
      
    7 It is alleged that the First Defendant then retreated across the street to his front yard. Both men continued to hurl abuse at each other from opposite sides of the street. Mr Towney is alleged to have said words to the effect “If you want a fight, we’ll go at it in the street like men. Anyone can use a knife”. It is alleged that one of Mr Towney’s sons then returned with what is described as a butcher’s knife. He gave it to Mr Towney, who then charged into the middle of the street yelling “If you want to fight, come over here” whilst waving the knife, described as having a black handle and a silver blade and being about 20-30 centimetres in length. 
     
      
    8 The First Defendant is then said to have retreated further to the front porch of his home, whilst Mr Towney moved onto the front driveway of the First Defendant’s home, continuing to entice him into a further confrontation. At that point, an independent witness and Mr Towney’s wife both contacted the police. It is alleged that, upon hearing that the arrival of police was imminent, Mr Towney gave the knife back to his son and advised him to return it to its kept place. 
     
      
    9 It is alleged that, at about 11.55 am, police arrived at the scene and placed the First Defendant under arrest. It is said that police questioned the First Defendant as to the whereabouts of the knife used by him, and he led police into his kitchen and showed them where he put the knife. 
     
      
    10 It is said that Mr Towney was questioned by police, who initially denied ever producing a knife during the altercation. However, an independent witness came forward at the scene and informed police of his observations. Mr Towney was cautioned and questions were put to him in relation to the production of a knife, with him allegedly then stating that he had a knife, but had returned it to his kitchen prior to the arrival of the police. 
     
      
    11 Both the First Defendant and Mr Towney were conveyed to Parramatta Police Station and advised of their rights. Each was invited to participate in an electronically recorded interview by way of an ERISP. The First Defendant declined to be interviewed. Mr Towney chose to participate in an ERISP and, during the interview, made admissions to producing what he described as a “butcher’s knife” although he stated that he remained on his property and had no intention of using it. This statement contradicted that made by the First Defendant (presumably orally to the police before attending the police station) and that of an independent witness. 
     
      
    12 Both the First Defendant and Mr Towney were charged with affray (s.93C(1) Crimes Act 1900), being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence (s.114(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900), assault occasioning actual bodily harm (s.59(1) Crimes Act 1900) and common assault (s.61 Crimes Act 1900). 
     
      
       
      The Local Court Proceedings 
       
      
    13 The proceedings against the First Defendant came before the Parramatta Local Court on a number of occasions for mention, with an order being made for the prosecution brief to be served and for the defence to reply to the brief. On 27 May 2009, the charges against the First Defendant were fixed for hearing on 7 October 2009 at the Parramatta Local Court. 
     
      
    14 The police brief of evidence was served on the defence on 10 September 2009. 
     
      
    15 The matter came before the Parramatta Local Court for hearing on 7 October 2009. The prosecutor informed the Court that the charges of affray and being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence were to proceed (by way of summary hearing) with the charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault being backup charges. The First Defendant was represented by counsel at the hearing on 7 October 2009. 
     
      
    16 At the outset, the prosecutor informed the Magistrate that Mr Towney was to be called by the prosecution, that a subpoena had been served for his attendance and that he was not yet at Court. Discussion ensued during which the First Defendant’s counsel informed the Court that, although Mr Towney’s ERISP had been served upon the defence, he had not made a written statement as a witness. 
     
      
    17 Whilst discussion continued concerning the absence of a written statement, Mr Towney arrived at Court. His Honour allowed a short adjournment for the prosecutor and the First Defendant’s counsel to discuss the issues in the case.  
     
      
    18 Upon resumption, the prosecutor made application under s.188(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to dispense with the requirements of s.188(1), so as to permit evidence to be adduced from Mr Towney, although the relevant statutory requirement for service of a written statement from him had not been met. The prosecutor referred his Honour to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions v West [2000] NSWCA 103; 48 NSWLR 647 in support of the application. 
     
      
    19 The First Defendant’s counsel opposed the prosecutor’s dispensation application under s.188(2) (pages 5-6, 7 October 2009). During the course of submissions to the Local Court, defence counsel said (page 6.2, 7 October 2009): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is my submission that if the prosecution are in a position to take the statement  
        [from] 
         the witness  
        [Mr Towney] 
         that an adjournment to allow that to proceed and an adjournment to allow that new evidence to be properly considered and instructions taken would be an appropriate way of correcting the defect in this case.” 
        
       
      
    20 Soon after, defence counsel submitted to his Honour that the ERISP recording was not a written statement for the purpose of s.183 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and, as a result, no written statement had been served by the prosecution as part of the brief of evidence. He submitted (page 6.23, 7 October 2009): 
     
      
       
        
        “The criteria outlined in  
        [ 
        Director of Public Prosecutions v West 
        ]  
        I would submit provides a recourse for the court to turn to to remedy that and that is to grant an adjournment for taking of that statement and then the service of it. If that is my friend’s application to adjourn the proceedings to allow for that statement to be taken, then I would consent to that adjournment. But at this stage in the absence of a statement, a written statement being in existence taken from Mr  
        [Towney] 
         that to proceed with the case and seek to rely simply on the ERISP recording.” 
        
       
      
    21 Although the transcript prepared from the sound recording of the hearing is slightly confusing in the lastmentioned passage, it is clear that the position of the First Defendant’s counsel at the Local Court hearing was: 
     
      
       
      (a) to oppose an order being made under s.188(2) which would have permitted the hearing to proceed that day, with Mr Towney being called to give evidence without a written statement (although the ERISP may have provided some understanding of his likely evidence); 
       
       
      (b) to consent to an adjournment of the hearing, to allow a written statement to be taken from Mr Towney which would then be served for the purpose of the relisted hearing of the matter. 
       
      
    22 At this point, the Magistrate expressed dissatisfaction that the absence of a written statement from Mr Towney was being addressed for the first time on the date fixed for hearing, with neither the prosecutor nor the First Defendant’s solicitor having adverted to the issue on a prior occasion (pages 6.36-7.15, 7 October 2009). 
     
      
    23 The prosecutor then stated that the primary application was to allow the evidence of Mr Towney to be admitted that day (the s.188(2) application) with an alternative application being for an adjournment (page 7.22, 7 October 2009). 
     
      
    24 A further exchange took place between his Honour and the prosecutor, before his Honour refused both of the prosecutor’s applications. It is appropriate to set out the totality of what was said from the time that the prosecutor ventilated the adjournment application (pages 7.31-9.16, 7 October 2009): 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: I understand your submission. Is it your understanding then that the informant and whoever checks his work were under the impression that this was a normal procedure? 
         
         
        PROSECUTOR: Yes, your Honour. It wasn't a- 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: What kind of idiots check his work? 
         
         
        PROSECUTOR: Good question. I don't know, your Honour, I can't - I simply cannot answer that. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: I find this whole thing to be irritating in the extreme, and I'm not blaming you, Ms Nightingale  
        [the prosecutor] 
        . 
         
         
        PROSECUTOR: Thank you, your Honour. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: At the end of the day this is something quite extraordinary and for nobody to have noticed since April, on either side, that this quite extraordinary is beyond my understanding. Now what you are doing, and I am saying this for the record rather than simply to attack your position, but what you are doing is asking me to exercise a discretion without any foundation for its exercise beyond saying it would be nice to have this evidence in. The procedures which were established and formalised by the chief magistrate in, as I understand it, complete cooperation with the then Commissioner of Police - yes, you may sit; sit down. 
         
         
        PROSECUTOR: Thank you, your Honour. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Those procedures were formalised for the purposes of not having to have these discussions. Now if some idiot has told your officer in charge that, ‘Oh this will do that, you know, the dumb magistrate on the day will concede to it going in notwithstanding that the whole thing is about prejudice or possible prejudice to the defendant,’ then I find that quite frightening. I thought, I was under the impression from the police spin in the media that the quality of police education in these matters had improved and that circumstances like this were never going to happen again; but it's not the case sadly and it's not just this case that brings it to notice. But I don't see anything in what you've put to me which explains why the procedure wasn't followed. 
         
         
        Now without that, how can you properly expect me to exercise a discretion beyond saying that it would be nice to have the evidence in because it's all terribly important. But if it was so important, why didn't they get it right in the first place? I can't accede to your proposition. I think that the prosecution has failed to comply with the elements of the Criminal Procedure Act and in those circumstance for me to exercise a discretion under s 188 without being given any possible foundation or reason for doing it, or explanation as to why this extraordinary course was followed by the prosecution, without that how can I be reasonably asked to do anything? 
         
         
        It's the defendant who's here today to answer the matter. I think that there are problems in the way the defendant's advisers have responded to this issue prior to this day. There is no explanation in the material that is being maintained by the court to explain how it arrives today with an inadequate and in my view inadmissible prosecution brief. I find my situation to be impossible and in the circumstances the prosecution application is denied. Does that mean then that you have no other evidence which you can bring? 
         
         
        PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, can I just clarify? Is the application in terms of the adjournment also refused? 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
         
         
        PROSECUTOR: Thank you, your Honour. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Well, to make it clear, the defendant is here to answer the charge, I can't honestly see that the situation is likely to improve greatly by adjourning. I don't from what I've heard so far I don't see that this is a case which is life and death to the administration of justice in New South Wales, but if it was, why wasn't it done properly? The defendant is here, he has a lawyer which I presume he's paying; under the circumstances, why should he be asked to go back when the prosecution could have done it right the first time? 
         
         
        PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, it's on that basis that the prosecution have no evidence to offer. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Thank you, Ms Nightingale. 
         
         
        PROSECUTOR: Thank you, your Honour. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: In the circumstances, your client is discharged. I don't know what the background of all of this was, I think it's all very unfortunate that he finds himself here today. I trust that he won't allow himself to get into whatever situation he was that caused this again. You can be excused. 
         
         
        MORTIMER: Thank you, your Honour.” 
        
       
      
    25 The Plaintiff commenced proceedings in this Court on 13 January 2010 challenging the decision of the Magistrate on 7 October 2009, which had effectively brought to an end the prosecution of the First Defendant with respect to these matters.  
     
      
       
      Statutory Scheme for Service of Briefs of Evidence for Summary Hearings 
       
      
    26 Offences of affray (s.93C(1) Crimes Act 1900) and being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence (s.114(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900) are both Table 1 offences for the purposes of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and are to be dealt with in the Local Court unless an election is made by the prosecutor or the accused person for trial on indictment: s.260 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The maximum penalty which can be imposed for each offence in the Local Court is imprisonment for two years: s.267 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
     
      
    27 No election was made for trial on indictment. Accordingly, the hearing of these matters in the Local Court on 7 October 2009 was to proceed as a summary hearing, thereby attracting pretrial procedures contained in ss.182-189 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. In particular, it is important to observe that ss.183, 186, 187 and 188 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 applied to these proceedings. Those provisions state: 
     
      
       
        
        “183  
         Brief of evidence to be served on accused person where not guilty plea 
         
         
          
          (1) If an accused person pleads not guilty to an offence, the prosecutor must, subject to section 187, serve or cause to be served on the accused person a copy of the brief of evidence relating to the offence. 
           
           
          (2) The brief of evidence is, unless the regulations otherwise provide, to consist of documents regarding the evidence that the prosecutor intends to adduce in order to prove the commission of the offence and is to include: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) written statements taken from the persons the prosecutor intends to call to give evidence in proceedings for the offence, and 
             
             
            (b) copies of any document or any other thing, identified in such a written statement as a proposed exhibit. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (3) The copy of the brief of evidence is to be served at least 14 days before the hearing of the evidence for the prosecution. 
           
           
          (4) The Magistrate may set a later date for service with the consent of the accused person or if of the opinion that the circumstances of the case require it.  
          
         
         
        …

        Form of copy of brief of evidence 
         
         
          
          (1) The copy of the brief of evidence is to comply with any requirement applicable to it prescribed by the rules. 
           
           
          (2) A written statement contained in the brief of evidence is to comply with this Act and any requirement applicable to it prescribed by the rules. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        187  
        When brief of evidence need not be served 
         
         
          
          (1) The court may order that all or part of the copy of the brief of evidence need not be served if it is satisfied: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) that there are compelling reasons for not requiring service, or 
             
             
            (b) that it could not reasonably be served on the accused person. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (2) The court may make an order under this section on its own initiative or on the application of any party. 
           
           
          (3) An order may be made subject to any conditions that the court thinks fit. 
           
           
          (4) Without limiting any other power to adjourn proceedings, the court may grant one or more adjournments, if it appears to it to be just and reasonable to do so, if the copy of the brief of evidence is not served in accordance with this Division. For that purpose, the court may extend the time for service of the brief of evidence. 
           
           
          (5) A prosecutor is not required to serve a brief of evidence in proceedings for an offence of a kind, or proceedings of a kind, prescribed by the regulations. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        188  
        Evidence not to be admitted 
         
         
          
          (1) The court must refuse to admit evidence sought to be adduced by the prosecutor in respect of an offence if, in relation to that evidence, this Division or any rules made under this Division have not been complied with by the prosecutor. 
           
           
          (2) The court may, and on the application of or with the consent of the accused person must, dispense with the requirements of subsection (1) on such terms and conditions as appear just and reasonable.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    28 Section 183(1) requires service by the prosecutor of a brief of evidence upon the accused person, and s.183(2)(a) requires that the brief of evidence is to include “written statements taken from the persons the prosecutor intends to call to give evidence in proceedings for the offence”. Section 183(3) requires a copy of the brief of evidence to be served at least 14 days before the hearing of the evidence for the prosecution with provision, in s.183(4), for the Magistrate to set a later date for service with the consent of the accused person or if of the opinion that the circumstances of the case require it.  
     
      
    29 Section 186(2) provides that a written statement contained in the brief of evidence is to comply with the Act and any requirement applicable to it prescribed by the rules. Rule 3.13 of the Local Court Rules 2009 provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “3.13  
        Written statements in briefs of evidence 
         
         
          
          (1) A written statement that is included in a copy of a brief of evidence may be in the form of questions and answers. 
           
           
          (2) A written statement that is included in a copy of a brief of evidence must: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) specify the name and age of the person who made the statement, and 
             
             
            (b) be endorsed in accordance with rule 3.6 (1) and (2) by the maker of the statement, and 
             
             
            (c) be written in a language of which the person who made the statement has a reasonable understanding, and 
             
             
            (d) be signed by the person who made the statement. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (3) If the person is unable to sign the written statement, the statement may be signed by another person with the consent of and in the presence of the person who made the statement. 
           
           
          (4) The other person must sign an endorsement on the statement to the effect that the person signed the statement on behalf of, with the consent of and in the presence of the person who made the statement. 
           
           
          (5) A written statement must be signed by another person as a witness to the signing of the statement by the person who made it or as a witness to the signing by another person on the maker’s behalf (if applicable). 
           
           
          (6) If a copy of the brief of evidence includes any written statement that is, wholly or in part, in a language other than English, there must be annexed to it: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) a document purporting to contain a translation of the statement, or so much of it as is not in the English language, into the English language, and 
             
             
            (b) a certificate by the translator stating his or her qualifications and certifying that the translation is a correct translation of the document.“ 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    30 It will be observed that Rule 3.13(2)(b) requires a written statement to be endorsed in accordance with Rule 3.6(1) and (2) by the maker of the statement. Rule 3.6 Local Court Rules 2009 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “3.6  
        Endorsement and certification of written statements 
         
         
          
          (1) Subject to subrule (2), an endorsement referred to in section 79 (3) of the 1986 Act is to be in or to the effect of the following form: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
             
              
              ‘This statement made by me accurately sets out the evidence that I would be prepared, if necessary, to give in court as a witness. The statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I will be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything that I know to be false or do not believe to be true.’ 
              
             
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (2) In the case of a child, or an adult who is apparently of appreciably below average intelligence, it is sufficient if the endorsement includes: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) words to the effect that the statement is true, or 
             
             
            (b) words to the effect that the statement contains no lies. 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (3) A written statement that is in a language other than English and has a document purporting to contain an English translation of the statement or part annexed to it in accordance with section 79 (5) of the 1986 Act must also have annexed to it a certificate by the translator stating his or her qualifications and certifying that the translation is a correct translation of the document.“ 
          
         
        
       
      
    31 At the hearing in this Court, counsel for the Plaintiff accepted that an ERISP was not a written statement for the purpose of these provisions. In particular, it was accepted that Mr Towney’s ERISP did not comply with Rule 3.13(2)(b) and (d) Local Court Rules 2009 in that it did not carry the endorsement required by Rule 3.6(1). Further, it was not signed by Mr Towney so as to comply with Rule 3.13(2)(d).  
     
      
    32 It is noteworthy that Rule 3.13(1) provides that a written statement may be in the form of questions and answers. The provisions do not require a narrative statement only. However, it is necessary that the written statement (even in the form of questions and answers) include the endorsement by the witness that the statement accurately sets out the evidence that the witness would be prepared to give, and that the statement is true to the best of the witness’ knowledge and belief and that the witness is making the statement, knowing that if it is tendered in evidence, then he or she will be liable to prosecution if he or she has wilfully stated in it anything known to be false or not believed to be true. This endorsement is no formality. It is intended to ensure that the witness understands the importance of the statement, the need for truth and accuracy and the consequences of the making of any knowingly false statement. 
     
      
    33 Of course, an ERISP is in the form of questions and answers. Ordinarily, there will be no controversy concerning the accuracy of the recording of what was said by the person being interviewed, given the electronic measures used for that purpose. However, a person being interviewed by way of an ERISP is ordinarily a suspect, being interviewed under caution. The person is not being interviewed, at that stage at least, as a possible witness in proceedings against another person. There is a significant difference between an interview with a suspect conducted by way of an ERISP, and a written statement from a witness taken for the purpose of inclusion in a brief of evidence under s.183 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
     
      
    34 It might be said that service of an ERISP given by a person proposed to be called as a witness is better than the absence of any document containing the account of the person who is to be called. If the person refuses to make and sign a written statement which complies with the legislative scheme, then it may be that service of an ERISP from a person whom the prosecution seeks to call will be a necessary step, in support of a prosecution application under s.188(2), that the Court dispense with the requirements of s.188(1) so as to permit that person to give evidence.  
     
      
    35 However, that is not this case. There was no suggestion in the Local Court that police had sought to obtain a written statement from Mr Towney but that he had refused to give one. The position appears to have been that the view was formed by one or more police officers that service of Mr Towney’s ERISP would suffice, accompanied by the service of a subpoena directed to him to attend Court on the hearing day.  
     
      
    36 As the Magistrate described in direct terms, this approach was clearly wrong. To comply with the statutory scheme, it was necessary for the prosecution to obtain a written statement from Mr Towney containing the necessary endorsement, as well as his signature. This was not done. 
     
      
       
      Submissions of the Parties 
       
      
    37 Although Mr Bourke submitted that the Magistrate had fallen into error in declining the prosecutor’s dispensation application under s.188(2), which would have permitted Mr Towney to be called as a witness on the hearing, his primary submission was that the refusal to adjourn proceedings gave rise to a denial of procedural fairness. I will concentrate on this argument, which I propose to uphold. Mr Bourke submitted that the following particular features pointed to error in the refusal of the adjournment so as to constitute a denial of procedural fairness. 
     
      
    38 Firstly, the Magistrate did not take into account the serious nature of the charges, rather taking a contrary view that the alleged offences were, in some way, not serious.  
     
      
    39 Secondly, it appears that his Honour gave little or no weight to the fact that the First Defendant’s counsel had consented to an adjournment of the proceedings.  
     
      
    40 Thirdly, it was submitted that no regard was had to the fact that this was the first time the matter had been listed for hearing.  
     
      
    41 Fourthly, it was submitted that the refusal of the adjournment was fatal to the prosecution case, so that the refusal of an adjournment denied a party a hearing.  
     
      
    42 Fifthly, it was submitted that there was a need to balance the important requirement of the speedy and efficient determination of proceedings with the due administration of justice, whereby serious criminal charges were determined on the merits. 
     
      
    43 Sixthly, it was submitted that the Magistrate’s decision was flawed because of a failure to give adequate reasons.  
     
      
    44 The Plaintiff submitted that the Magistrate’s discretion was, in effect, not exercised at all, and that there appears to have been an element of punishment of the prosecution in the decision to refuse the adjournment application. 
     
      
    45 The thrust of the First Defendant’s submissions was that the proceedings should not go back to the Local Court, given the fact that he had a defence to the charges and by reference to various steps which the First Defendant said he had taken to get his life on track. No specific submission was directed to the grounds of the Plaintiff’s claim for relief, with the First Defendant’s submissions going to the exercise of any residual discretion to decline to send the matter back to the Local Court.  
     
      
       
      Determination of Proceedings 
       
      
    46 In my view, the strength of the Plaintiff’s case and the resolution of these proceedings lies in the area of the Magistrate’s refusal to adjourn the Local Court hearing. As Mr Bourke acknowledged, the challenge to the Magistrate’s ruling on the s.188(2) application is complicated by the absence of any satisfactory explanation by the prosecutor as to why a written statement had not been sought from Mr Towney. The prosecution position appears to have arisen from an erroneous view concerning the use of an ERISP, when it ought to have been clear that Mr Towney’s ERISP did not comply with the requirements for a written statement. 
     
      
    47 Section 187(4) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that the Local Court may adjourn proceedings, if it appears to be just and reasonable, where a brief of evidence has not been served in accordance with the statutory scheme. In Director of Public Prosecutions v West, consideration was given (at 655-657 [24]) to s.66G Justices Act 1902, the statutory predecessor to s.187(4). Section 187(4) is not identical in terms to s.66G. It is clear that s.187(4) reposes a discretion in the Local Court to adjourn proceedings if it appears to be just and reasonable to do so. 
     
      
    48 In Watson v Watson (1968) 70 SR(NSW) 203 at 206, Asprey JA observed (at 206E) that, whilst it is the paramount duty of the court to see that justice is done, nevertheless “in doing justice a court proceeds on a two-way street and in the exercise of a discretion the rights of both the parties to the litigation must be considered”. 
     
      
    49 The requirement to accord procedural fairness extends to both the defence and the prosecution in criminal proceedings: The Queen v Lewis [1988] HCA 24; 165 CLR 12 at 17. 
     
      
    50 In Blazevski v Judges of the District Court (1992) 29 ALD 197, Kirby P (as his Honour then was) referred to cases where appellate courts will intervene on an appeal against the refusal of an adjournment, and said at 200: 
     
      
       
        
        “In ‘particular circumstances’, therefore, appellate courts will resolutely intervene both for the assurance of justice and the manifest appearance of justice and to uphold the integrity of the system of justice. See  
        R v Sussex Justices; Ex parte McCarthy 
         [1924] 1 KB 256 (CA) at 258. Courts providing judicial review to rectify departures from the requirements of procedural fairness will likewise give relief for departures from such requirements which will have taken the trial court outside the proper exercise of its jurisdiction. In criminal cases, they will do so where the injustice has been done to the prosecution as well as to the accused. See for example  
        R v Dudley Justices; Ex parte Director of Public Prosecutions 
        , (Times Law Reports, 24 June 1992) at 10 (Mann LJ).” 
        
       
      
    51 In Nitiva v Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] NSWCA 332, the Court of Appeal (Sheller and Beazley JJA and Cole AJA) said at [64]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The principles upon which an adjournment ought to be granted are well established. The court has a discretion to grant or refuse an adjournment. However, a refusal to grant an adjournment can, in certain circumstances, constitute a denial of procedural fairness: see  
        Sullivan v Department of Transport 
         (1978) 20 ALR 323. As Deane J said in that case at 343 ‘… it is important to remember that the relevant duty of the court is to ensure that a party is given a reasonable opportunity to present his case’.” 
        
       
      
    52 In the context of an appeal from a Magistrate’s decision refusing a prosecutor’s adjournment application, it was observed that, whilst the power to adjourn is discretionary, it must not be exercised so as to work a manifest injustice on one party by depriving a party of a hearing, unless there is no other way to do substantial justice between the parties: Bell v Imrie (Yeldham J, 24 February 1989) 8 Petty Sessions Review 3905 at 3906. 
     
      
    53 A Magistrate may be more inclined to refuse a prosecution adjournment for the hearing of a minor offence as opposed to what might be characterised as more serious offences: McRae v Redmond (Smart J, 7 May 1987) 8 Petty Sessions Review 3534 at 3540-3542. There is a public interest in the determination of criminal charges by a hearing on their merits: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Fungavaka [2010] NSWSC 917 at [38]. 
     
      
    54 The proper exercise of the discretion to adjourn entails a balancing exercise taking into account relevant considerations. These considerations include the gravity of the charges, the public interest in the determination by way of a hearing on the merits of criminal charges, the attitude of the accused person to the adjournment application and the circumstances which have given rise to the application for adjournment. It has been said that the principle of double jeopardy ought also be considered where a prosecution application for an adjournment of criminal proceedings is made: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Ozakca [2006] NSWSC 1245; 68 NSWLR 325 at 330-331 [17]-[25]. In that case, Rothman J expressed the view that it would take exceptional circumstances before an appellate court, exercising powers of appeal or prerogative relief, will interfere with an exercise of discretion refusing a prosecution application for adjournment (at 331 [23]).  
     
      
    55 It is the case that the First Defendant, through his counsel, consented to the prosecution application for adjournment. This aspect was of fundamental importance to the exercise of discretion whether to adjourn the proceedings. The accused person was not opposing the adjournment, nor contending that double jeopardy considerations ought lead to a refusal of the prosecution application. To the contrary, the First Defendant was consenting to the prosecution application. This was a fundamental factor which, if not controlling the outcome of the application, ought to have weighed heavily in favour of the prosecution application. 
     
      
    56 I am satisfied that the present charges may be appropriately characterised as serious, albeit with the charges to be determined summarily in the Local Court. The prosecution alleges that the First Defendant used a knife during the course of the confrontation, with an injury resulting to Mr Towney’s face. These are not trivial charges. There is a public interest in the hearing and determination of these charges on the merits. The learned Magistrate fell into clear error in downplaying, in the way mentioned earlier at [24], the apparent seriousness of these charges.  
     
      
    57 It was clear that the refusal of the application would be fatal to the prosecution case. The prosecution had Mr Towney in attendance at Court, so that it may well be concluded that a statement would be obtained from him for the purpose of a future hearing. Further, this was the first listed hearing of the matter.  
     
      
    58 The Magistrate was entitled to be concerned that the prosecution had allowed this state of affairs to come about through an apparent fundamental misunderstanding of the requirements for a brief of evidence. His Honour was also entitled to express dissatisfaction that the First Defendant’s legal representative had not raised this issue at an earlier time. However, judicial dissatisfaction concerning the inefficient conduct of the proceedings by the parties should not have controlled the outcome of the adjournment application, which fell to be determined in accordance with the principles referred to at [47] to [54] above, and with the defence consent to the adjournment application being kept firmly in mind. 
     
      
    59 Accepting that this Court should not lightly interfere with the exercise of discretion on an unsuccessful prosecution adjournment application, I am well satisfied that the Plaintiff has established an entitlement to relief in this case. I accept that the appropriate form of relief is an order in the nature of certiorari under s.69 Supreme Court Act 1970. There has been no hearing on the merits, so that the Magistrate’s order of dismissal of the charges should not stand in the way of a grant of such relief: Director of Public Prosecutions v Cassell (1995) 80 A Crim R 160 at 168-171, 173-174.  
     
      
    60 I do not consider that this Court should decline, for discretionary reasons, to remit the matters to the Local Court for hearing. Clear error has been established. There is a real public interest in the determination of these criminal charges on the merits. The appropriate course is that the matters should proceed to a hearing on the merits in the trial court. 
     
      
       
      Costs 
       
      
    61 The Plaintiff seeks an order for costs against the First Defendant, but submits that it would be appropriate, in the circumstances of the case, that the Court grant the First Defendant a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act 1951. 62 I do not consider a costs order should be made in this case. The failure of the police to obtain a written statement from Mr Towney gave rise to the problem in the Local Court. It is true that the First Defendant’s legal representative took the point for the first time on the hearing date, thereby contributing to the problems confronting the Magistrate. However, the First Defendant consented to an adjournment of the Local Court hearing. I have found error in the Magistrate’s refusal to adjourn, despite defence consent to the prosecution application. In this Court, the First Defendant did not argue that there had been no denial of procedural fairness. As a matter of discretion, a costs order should not be made against the First Defendant in these circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    63 I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) an order calling up the record of the Parramatta Local Court relating to the First Defendant on 7 October 2009; 
       
       
      (b) an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the decision of the Parramatta Local Court on 7 October 2009 refusing the prosecution’s application for adjournment; 
       
       
      (c) an order quashing the order of dismissal made by the Parramatta Local Court on 7 October 2009 with respect to the charges brought against the First Defendant; 
       
       
      (d) an order that the proceedings be remitted to the Parramatta Local Court to be heard and determined according to law; 
       
       
      (e) I make no order as to costs.

He brings proceedings for damages for defamation and injurious falsehood arising out of the publication by the defendant at a school Parents and Citizens Association (hereafter “P&C”) meeting on 30 November 2008 of the following words: 
     
     “Mr Shandil has committed forgery. He has forged signatures of two teachers on teacher profile forms. I have had legal advice that Mr Shandil has committed forgeries. Mr Shandil should be dismissed and terminated from his position as principal of the school and otherwise I will call the police.” 
    [2] The plaintiff pleaded that these words give rise to the following imputations: 
     
     (a) the plaintiff committed forgery; 
      
      
     (b) the plaintiff forged the signatures of teachers on profile forms; 
      
      
     (c) the plaintiff is a criminal; 
      
      
     (d) the plaintiff should be dismissed from his position of principal of the Australian Institute of Hindi Language Studies; 
      
      
     (e) the plaintiff’s conduct should be referred to the police. 
    [3] There is a claim for republication as follows: 
     
     (a) the defendant caused Mr Sohan Singh of Sohan Singh & Associates, Barristers & Solicitors to republish the same words or words to similar effect in a letter to the Officer in Charge, Mount Druitt Police Station, dated 17 January 2009, which letter stated, among other things, that the plaintiff had forged two signatures and passed off documents as original, and called for a police investigation into the plaintiff; 
      
      
     (b) the defendant caused these words or words of the same substance to be published to members of the Australian Institute of Hindi Language Studies on 8 February 2009; and 
      
      
     (c) the defendant caused the defamatory words to be published by the secretary of the Australian Institute of Hindi Language Studies, Mr Prasad, in a letter written to Mr Sunil Kumar and his wife on 10 February 2009. 
    The contents of the republication letters[4] The contents of the publications of 17 January, 8 and 10 February 2009 relied upon as republications of the defendant’s slander are as follows:

     Dear members, 
      
      
     Re: Special Meeting 
      
      
     A special general meeting will be held on Sunday,  
     22 February 2009 at Rooty Hill High School Hall at 1.20 p.m 
     . 
      
      
     This meeting is held under Section 10 of the Australian Institute of Hindi Language Studies Parents and Citizens Association Inc. Constitution. We have consulted the [sic] legal advisor and the Department of Fair Trading and under Section 19(3) of Association Incorporation Act 1984,  
     Rule 10 of our Constitution overrides Rule 25(4) of the Model Rule for Incorporate Association 
     . 
      
      
     In accordance with Rule 10 of our Constitution, the meeting can only be called by the Secretary or the Executive Committee. Hence, a special meeting called by any other member will be null and void. 
      
      
     Rule 19(3) of Associations Incorporation Act 1984 No 143 states that “ 
     Where in relation to any matter the model rules make provision but the rules of an incorporated association do not make provision, the provision of the model rules shall, in relation to that matter, be deemed to be included in the rules of the incorporated association. 
     ” 
      
      
     Currently, the brief outline of the situation is: 
      
     · Mr Ashok Shandil’s dismissal from voluntary service was based on both disciplinary issues and commercial consideration including restructuring. 
      
     · Mr Shandil forged two signatures of two applicant teachers on the Teacher Profile Form which was submitted to the Department of Community Language Studies. This matter has been reported to the Mount Druitt Police for investigation on the instruction of the Schools Legal Advisor. If the Community had not reported the matter, the Committee would have been concealing a serious criminal offence. 
      
     · Mr Shandil was invited to show cause at the Executive Committee meeting held on 30 November 2008. He admitted that he had forged the signatures and it was an illegal act. He further said “What can you guys do?” 
      
     · Mr Shandil refused the request of the Committee to discuss further matters raised against him. 
      
     · On 23 December 2008, Mr Shandil referred the matter to the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales for unfair dismissal. The first conciliation was held on 20 January 2009. The second conciliation will be held on  
     18 February 2009 
     . 
      
     · Upon legal advice, any special meeting called before 18 February 2009 to discuss this matter is deemed to undermine the Australian Judicial system. 
      
      
     Agenda 
      
      
     · Brief the Association members about the above situation only.

     Dear Mr Sunil Kumar and Mrs Urmila Kumar, 
      
      
     Further to our communication dated 8 February 2009, I would like to inform you that any act subsequent our earlier communication by you would be wrong in law and contrary to our Constitution. 
      
      
     Please note that this information has already been provided to you in our notice for our special meeting dated 8 February 2009. 
      
      
     You both are pursuing activities in support of Mr Ashok Shandil whose voluntary services from the school have been dismissed based on both disciplinary issues and commercial consideration. This disciplinary action resulted from Mr Shandil forging two signatures of two teachers on the Teacher Profile Form that was submitted to the Department of Community Language Studies. You have also been made aware that this matter has been reported to the Mount Druitt Police for investigation. The Principal of Rooty Hill High School has barred Mr Ashok Shandil from entering the school premises until the matter that is currently in the Industrial Relations Commission is resolved legally. Please note that Mr Ashok Shandil has instigated this matter in the Industrial Relations Commission for unfair dismissal. 
      
      
     After the first hearing in the Industrial Relations Commission, you both have been lobbying on behalf of Mr. Ashok Shandil to have him reinstated as the Principal in the Hindi School with the full knowledge that the matter is scheduled for a second hearing on 18 February 2009. By taking such course of action, both of you are undermining the Australian Judicial system. 
      
      
     You are seeking to have a special meeting on 15 February 2009 under Rule 10 of our school’s constitution. The School Executive Committee approached the Department of Fair Trading for clarification on this rule. The department has stated that Rule 19(3) of the Associations Incorporation Act 1984 No 143 states that “ 
     Where in relation to any matter the model rules make provision but the rules of an incorporated association do not make provision, the provision of the model rules shall, in relation to that matter, be deemed to be included in the rules of the incorporated association. 
     ” This rule has been brought to your attention but you choose to ignore and are determined to proceed with the special meeting on 15 February 2009. 
      
      
     Please note that the Executive Committee will call a meeting on 22 February 2009 to brief the Association members about matters resulting in Mr. Ashok Shandil’s dismissal and the outcome of the second hearing of the Industrial Relations Commission. 
      
      
     We believe that as teachers of mainstream school in NSW, both of you are bound by conduct applicable for your institution and likewise we expect you to display the same ethics and conduct with our institute. 
      
      
     We are of the view that the Executive Committee will handle all matters in relation to the institute and any of your efforts in the interruption of running of the institute will be taken further. We believe that you are threatening the Executive Committee through certain members and we politely request you to desist such activities. 
      
      
     Yours sincerely 
      
     Virendra Prasad

    Matters no longer in issue[5] The claim for injurious falsehood asserts that the plaintiff spoke the words on or about 30 November 2008 falsely and maliciously, and that the plaintiff suffered loss and damage. Particulars are provided in the statement of claim concerning falsity, malice and special damage. This claim was abandoned during closing submissions. The claim for special damages in relation to the defamation action was also abandoned, but at the commencement of the trial.[6] There were proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission between the plaintiff and the school of which he was principal. Those proceedings were settled. There has been no reliance upon the terms of that settlement by the defendant in relation to the quantum of the defamation claim.[7] At the commencement of the trial counsel for the plaintiff complained that the defendant’s answers to interrogatories relating to the qualified privilege defences had been answered by a denial of publication, which was inconsistent with the maintaining of defences of qualified privilege. Applications were brought at the commencement of, and during, the hearing, to strike out these defences. At the close of the plaintiff’s case on the third day, this application was renewed. The defendant abandoned these defences and the trial proceeded without any cross-examination of the defendant on issues relevant to these defences, although malice remained an issue in the trial because of the injurious falsehood claim. [8] When submissions were served, the defendant brought an application to replead his defence of qualified privilege at common law (but not pursuant to s 30). This belated application caused significant difficulties in that the plaintiff ‘s legal advisers sought an extension of time to consider whether to reopen their case or to oppose the application, and this delayed the submissions being finalised until 30 August 2010. This then conflicted with other court commitments of my own and it was not possible for me to finalise my judgment until I was able to review these further applications, as the additional matters raised by the defendant, and the consideration of how these impacted upon the evidence of the case, raised matters of factual as well as legal complexity. [9] It is necessary for me to set out the evidence in these proceedings in great detail, for the same reasons as those explained by Nicholas J in Ryan v Premachandran [2009] NSWSC 1186 at [9].The pleadings[10] The defendant pleaded defences of truth and qualified privilege at common law and pursuant to s 30 Defamation Act 2005 in the defence filed on 3 December 2009. The defence was justification was particularised by the simple assertion that the plaintiff had admitted to committing forgery and that the defendant had received legal advice to this effect (this latter particular was withdrawn at the trial). I made orders on 18 February and 26 March 2010 for the provision of particulars of truth, including service of statement and reports (anticipating expert reports on forgery and legal advice), and for answers to interrogatories. Those orders were not complied with by the defendant, although the matter was set down for trial on the understanding that pre-trial timetables would be complied with by both parties. As is set out in more detail below, the defendant never provided particulars of truth beyond the brief summary set out in the defence (part of which was withdrawn at the trial) and refused to answer interrogatories concerning the qualified privilege defences, as well as failing to give full discovery of documents going to the defence of qualified privilege.[11] The reason for giving a speedy trial date was that these were proceedings between the principal of the Australian Institute of Hindi Language Studies and the president of the P&C which conducted the school. My concerns about the limited resources of the parties, and the preservation of any ongoing relationship in the Indian community in Sydney, made me consider it was important, having regard to the provisions of s 60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and s 48 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) that these proceedings be listed for hearing as quickly as possible. I was guided, in the making of orders for the urgent hearing of these proceedings, by the nature of the particulars of truth, which asserted the plaintiff had conceded he was guilty of forgery and that the defendant had received legal advice, and by my understanding, from statements made by the defendant’s legal representatives, that these elements would be easily proved by tender of documents. In fact the plaintiff never admitted he was guilty of forgery, and not only did the defendant never obtain legal advice, but when he was advised to the contrary by the honorary solicitor for the school (Mr Narayan) he and the P&C sacked this solicitor from his position as the school’s legal adviser.The issues in this case[12] The issues in this case are as follows: 
     
     (a) Whether publication and republication occurred at all. The defendant denies that he spoke the words of the matter complained of on 30 November and denies any liability for republication; 
      
      
     (b) What imputations, if any, are conveyed and whether they are defamatory; 
      
      
     (c) Whether the defence of justification can be established.; 
      
      
     (d) Whether the defendant, who abandoned defences of qualified privilege at the close of the plaintiff’s case on the third day of the trial, should be permitted to reinstate the defence at common law; 
      
      
     (e) Whether the publication was made on an occasion protected by qualified privilege at common law and, if so, whether the occasion was defeated by malice; 
      
      
     (f) Whether damages should be awarded and if so, for what amount. 
    The evidence of the parties and their witnesses[13] The plaintiff and defendant each gave evidence. I shall set out the evidence of the plaintiff and the two school teachers who gave evidence concerning the filling out of the teacher profile forms.The plaintiff’s evidence[14] The plaintiff, who is currently 52 years of age, has been a teacher all his life. After graduating from the University of South Pacific, Fiji, with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and obtaining a graduate certificate in education, he came to Australia. He taught at Mount Druitt High School for nine years, then at Glenmore Park High School for two years, and for the last ten years at Cecil Hills High School. The plaintiff comes from a family of teachers; his father, sister, younger brother and sister-in-law are all also teachers.[15] In addition to his teaching duties as a teacher employed by the New South Wales government, the plaintiff had a strong interest in the Hindi language and culture, which is his cultural background. He took the necessary steps to set up a school to teach the Hindi language to children on weekends. Rooty Hill High School allowed its premises to be used on each Sunday of the school terms from July 2003. The plaintiff was supported by his wife in this endeavour. It was his evidence that the school was his wife’s idea (T 24). He negotiated a contract with the principal of Rooty Hill High School to use their premises, wrote the P&C Constitution, using the P&C Constitution of the school at which he taught, contacted the Department of Fair Trading and, together with his wife, organised community support for the establishment of the school.[16] Between July 2003 and the end of 2007, the plaintiff carried out all this work without any payment. By February 2008, the size of the school was such that he was able to be paid $100 for each Sunday of the school term.[17] The plaintiff not only set up the school and found suitably qualified teachers, but also wrote the curriculum. He was given a curriculum by an ex-teacher from Fiji who had written an Australian curriculum, which he updated. He was also responsible for the recruitment of staff and did all the interviewing. He advertised the school in the Indian community and also set up a school magazine which he edited. Copies of those magazines form Exhibit A. These magazines paint a very vivid picture of the many activities of the Hindi school in promoting not only Indian language, but also culture, including Indian classical music, traditional dance and “Bollywood” dancing. The plaintiff was the contact person for the school as far as the Department of Community Languages was concerned on all school issues. The Department of Community Languages is part of the Education Department (T 25). Although Hindi is a language which could be studied for the high school certificate, this was a small school, which provided classes from kindergarten to grade 6.[18] In July 2003, when the school started, there were 37 students. Towards the end of 2003 the number increased to 60. At first there were two classes. There was a composite class of very young children and a separate grade 2 class. The children were taught Hindi grammar, speaking, writing, reading and the alphabet. The lesson went for two hours on Sunday and there was an optional one-hour class for students wishing to learn classical Indian dancing or playing Indian musical instruments. At first only the harmonium was taught, but later the tabla was also taught.[19] The teachers were paid by the introduction of a small levy on every student who attended the school of $20, as well as by the proceeds from the school concert, as tickets were sold to the public. By setting up a school magazine with advertisements, extra income was earned. Right from the beginning, there was always a surplus, albeit a modest one (T 28). Every year there was an annual presentation as part of the school concert, which included a prize-giving ceremony; this usually took place in late November.[20] The school magazine started with a production run of 2,000 and increased to 2,500. The annual concerts were attended by about 400 people. The plaintiff would distribute leftover copies of the school magazine at Indian businesses and those other non-Indian businesses who advertised in the school magazine. He also provided copies to the Department of Education, the Minister for Education, and places of education in Fiji. He gave copies to visiting teachers from countries such as New Zealand, Canada, the USA or India. He also provided a copy to the Fiji Teachers Union and to council libraries in the western suburbs area. He spent many hours of his spare time in these voluntary activities.[21] Mr Shandil’s activities extended to all areas of school administration: 
     
     “Q. Do you know who wrote the department guidelines? 
      
     A. The department guidelines were written by the Department of Education, the community languages and according to those guidelines community language schools are supposed to prepare a curriculum. 
      
      
     Q. Who wrote the school policies in accordance with those guidelines? 
      
     A. I did. 
      
      
     Q. Do you know who was acting as the first aid officer? 
      
     A. I was 
      
      
     Q. Who was the main point of contact with the Department of Education? 
      
     A. I was. I was the school's contact person for the Department of Education. 
      
      
     Q. Who was responsible for organising the attendance of teachers at curriculum workshops? 
      
     A. I was. 
      
      
     Q. Sir, in respect of all of those things that you've given evidence about can you estimate how many hours a 
      
     week you think you might have spent on those things? 
      
     A. Is that in addition to the-- 
      
      
     Q. In addition to the Sundays. 
      
     A. It would average about between 2 to 3 hours.” (T 71 – 72) 
    [22] It was the plaintiff’s evidence that between July 2003 and 2008 the school was happy and harmonious. He performed all this work as a volunteer without pay until 2008, when he was paid a sum of $100 per week for his work as the school principal; in 2008 he was mainly involved in administration of the school, which was by now quite large.[23] By 2008 the school was employing 11 teachers, two of whom (Mrs Lata and Mrs Shikha Sharma) gave evidence. They were using 8 class rooms, teaching 86 students for 3 hours for 40 weeks of the year (Exhibit 4). The plaintiff was the contact person for funding arrangements (Exhibit 4). [24] In November 2007 the defendant, who had joined the Parents and Citizens Committee (the “P&C”) in 2004 (T 261 line 35) and become a member of the board of the P&C in 2007, was elected the president of the P&C. He had no background in teaching, and worked in a factory.[25] One of the tasks of the president of the P&C was to put in an annual application for funding from the Department of Community Languages in the Department of Education. This was a small grant of government money to assist the school in conducting its affairs (Exhibit 4). Extracts from the programme guidelines for funding requirements and conditions for 2008 are set out in Exhibit 5. [26] According to Exhibit 5, the general funding requirements required the school to have a proper corporate structure as a not-for-profit organisation, and for those involved in the school to ensure that schools under that company’s aegis were managed by a P&C “according to the rules of incorporation” (page 3). The school had to ensure that teachers meet minimum professional development standards as set out on pages 3-4 (Exhibit 5). Paragraph 3.2 sets out other conditions and responsibilities, none of which are submitted to be relevant here; there are provisions for indemnity and insurance, disability legislation, multiculturalism and prevention of fraud. Clause 3.2.9 refers to verification of the accuracy of information provided to the department and the appropriateness of the use of funds, and says that policies and procedures should be in place to ensure risk management and fraud control systems are working. It was not submitted that this clause had any relevance.[27] Under clause 3.2, Exhibit 5 warns that failure to meet the Program Guidelines Funding Requirements and Conditions “could result in the termination of the Funding Agreement” and states that the organisation will be advised and consulted prior to any such action being taken. The question is what amounts to a failure to meet the Program Guidelines. Whether that includes the school principal filling out (accurately) the teacher profile form for two teachers, and signing it with their authorisation, amounts to conduct which could result in the termination of the Funding Agreement is one of the disputed issues of fact in this case. There is, however, no evidence that the department ever considered such a step, or even knew about, let alone complained about, these forms having been filled in and signed in the principal’s handwriting rather than the teachers’. [28] The application process for funding is set out in paragraph 4.1.3 and includes information about the school, its banking details, its financial obligations (such as a GST information sheet) and the parent/guardian certification form. At paragraph 5.6 the following is set out: 
     
     “ 
     5.6 
       
     Teacher Profile Form 
      
      
     This form has two purposes: 
      
      
     · the information is used to create a register of teachers in community languages schools 
      
     · the information is used to establish whether the organisation meets minimum teacher professional development standards. 
      
      
     Teacher Profile Forms must be completed by each new teacher. A copy of teaching qualifications must be provided to the Program. 
      
      
     Teachers who cannot provide proof of qualifications must be enrolled in a course offered by the Program or an equivalent before the school is eligible for any further funding.” 
    [29] Clause 5.6, referring to the Teacher Profile Form, makes it clear that the purpose is to determine whether the teachers have appropriate qualifications. The forms must be completed by each new teacher together with a copy of teaching qualifications. There is no specific reference to a requirement for a signature. By comparison, the Parent/Guardian certification form (5.16) “must” be signed by the parents or guardians of each child on the class roll because their signature authorises the organisation to provide child details to the department.[30] The process of obtaining the grant was described by the plaintiff in his evidence as follows: 
     
     “Q. Why do the profile forms need to be lodged, Mr Shandil? 
      
     A. Just to create a registration of all teachers in registered community language schools. 
      
      
     Q. And it wasn't a requirement by the NSW Community Language Schools that these forms be lodged as part of the entire process for funding? 
      
     A. Not that I know of, because I've got to obtain copies of application using the Freedom of Information Act. I requested that the Department of Community Languages send me a copy of the form that was lodged on behalf of the Australian institute of language studies as far as funding was concerned, and they sent me a copy, and they did not send the profile form with them. All we used to get in the school was a per capita grant based on the number of students that we had. The per capita grant had nothing to do with teacher profile forms. These teacher profile forms, even if they were not sent, the department had no way of knowing who were the new teachers, and that would not have affected our grant in any way. 
      
      
     Q. You see, I put to you, Mr Shandil, that's simply not correct. 
      
     A. That's correct.  
      
      
     Q. I put to you that the lodgment of these teacher profile forms was a requirement of the New South Wales department as part of your funding and grant process. 
      
     A. It was a requirement definitely, but nothing to do with the grant. 
      
      
     Q. Mr Shandil, at the very least, if you haven't lodged these forms in time, there would have been criticism from the committee, wouldn't there? 
      
     A. The committee had no idea about this, because the committee did not see this. I asked the president for copies of this. He did not have copies of this.” (T 107 – 8) 
    [31] The plaintiff went on to explain why he considered this document not only was not part of the funding, but was not the subject of close attention by the department: 
     
     “For copies of our teacher profile forms for the year 2008 because this was done in 2008. As you can see, your Honour, these forms are for the year 2006. If the department really based their funding on this, they would have returned this form to me because I was the contact person of the school, and they would have asked me to redo another one, and correct the answer of question number 1 on both the profile forms. Question number 1 says, ""Are you a new teacher with community language schools 2006?"" and by mistake, I ticked ""yes"" in both columns, because this form is for the year 2006. So obviously the department has not bothered to even look at this.” (T 108) 
    [32] The plaintiff’s evidence was that he kept all the school files at his home, because there was no storage available at the high school where the classes were conducted. One pf the issues in contention was how the defendant, in those circumstances, obtained copies of the two teacher’s profile forms for Mrs Lata and Mrs Shikha Sharma.The plaintiff’s evidence as to how he came to sign the forms[33] The plaintiff had to fill out and post to the Department all the forms, including the attendance and teacher information. These were forms which also required the defendant’s signature, and the defendant wrote a note to the plaintiff about all the information the plaintiff had to supply to him (Exhibit S).[34] The plaintiff not only had to submit copies of these teachers’ educational qualifications, along with a profile form containing personal information, he also had to pick which areas they needed training in and fill out a second form identifying areas where these teachers needed training, and ticking the boxes for appropriate departmental workshops for these teachers: 
     
     “A. During the month of April we were supposed to fill in and post to the Department of Community Languages all the returns for the year. This includes the attendance, as well as the roll for each class, the number of teachers, their names and their qualifications. For new teachers we had to submit copies of their educational qualifications, along with a profile form.  
      
     A profile form which looks at some of their personal things, like their names, their place of residence, their contact numbers, how many years of experience they've had teaching the language, if any. I had to also pick which areas they needed training in so that in the future if the department was organising any workshop, they would be contacting me as a principal and I would then be talking to the teachers as to who lacked qualifications or training, or who needed training in a particular field.” (T 72) 
    [35] In the first week of the school holidays, the plaintiff had a conversation with Mrs Lata, about these issues. The first requirement was to confirm her personal details, and the second was to identify her training needs: 
     
     “Q. Can you tell us what it is, please? 
      
     A. It is a teacher profile form. It contains some personal information about teachers, their name, their place of residence, their telephone number, the language they teach, how long they been teaching a community language, which school they're teaching the community language at, the IBN ID - which is the school's identity number, which class the teachers are teaching, whether they're teaching in another language school and whether they're teaching in another institution, whether they have language teaching qualifications and the date of update of their qualifications, along with a signature.  
      
      
     Q. Why do you need to send such a form in? 
      
     A. The Department of Community Languages, their argument was they wanted to prepare a register of teachers teaching in various community schools just identify training needs. Like who needs better class management training, who needs curriculum training, who needs to be trained in how to handle discipline or welfare issues, those sorts of things. 
      
      
     Q. In respect of the document I've just shown you, is it for a particular person? 
      
     A. This one is for Shaireen Lata. 
      
      
     Q. Do you know whether you or somebody else filled that document in? 
      
     A. I did.” (T 73) 
    [36] There was a great deal of information to be put together, and the plaintiff said that because of the school vacation, time was short: 
     
     “Q. How did you come to fill that document in? 
      
     A. I have phoned Shaireen Lata and told her what this document was about, that I needed to send this over by 1 May. 1 May would still have been in our first term school holidays because our language school commenced on 4 May, that is the first Sunday of the second term. There was a deadline by 1 May, returns had to be given to that Department of Community Languages.  
      
      
     Q. Have you filled that document in based upon what she told you. Is that right? 
      
     A. That's true. 
      
      
     Q. Having done that, did she sign that form? 
      
     A. No, she did not. 
      
      
     Q. Why not? 
      
     A. Because I was about 15 kilometres away and like I say, this needed to be sent to the department in the holidays before 1 May. So I rang her and obtained her permission to see if it's okay. She said, ""It's okay."" 
      
      
     Q. She said it was okay? 
      
     A. She said, ""It's okay, yes."" She gave permission to write her signature.” (T 74) 
    [37] The plaintiff posted this document and kept a copy of it at his home, as there was no storage space at the school (T 73 – 74).[38] On 13 April, the plaintiff also had a discussion with Mrs Sharma about filling out this form, and about identifying her training needs: 
     
     “Q. In respect of that teacher did you do anything as far as filling in the forms were concerned? 
      
     A. Yes, I did. I filled in her teacher profile form. 
      
      
     Q. Can you tell me the circumstances in which you came to do that? 
      
     A. Basically the same reasons, the community language school would have opened for second term on 4 May. On 13 April, the last day of term 1 in that school, while Shikha Sharma was waiting for her husband to come and pick her up, I told her what this was. I mean, I did not really show her the form because I did not have the form for 2008 at that time. The president of the PNC association did not give me a copy of that, although all this went with the president as far as the need for funding was concerned. Funding for community language schools which was based on the number of students that we had. So I asked the president, he said that's too bulky, there's so many pages of it and he actually sent what he needed, or what needed me to do with his wife who taught with me in the same school.” (T 75) 
    [39] He explained why Mrs Sharma did not sign this document: 
     
     “Q. Did Ms Sharma sign that document? 
      
     A. No, she did not. 
      
      
     Q. Why not? 
      
     A. It was like the school holidays and she lives some distance away from me. She had already given me permission that I could fill and sign on her behalf. 
      
      
     Q. When did she give you that permission? 
      
     A. On 13 April, the last of our Hindi school in term 1.” (T 76) 
    [40] When the plaintiff returned to the school on 4 May, he had a conversation with the defendant in which he confirmed that these forms had been filled out and sent to the department: 
     
     “Q. The first day of school of the second term I think you said began on 4 May. 
      
     A. 4 May for our community language school. For mainstream schools, it begins earlier. We start school on the fifth Sunday of the first week of the term, yes. 
      
      
     Q. I see. 4 May. When you returned to the Hindi language school on 4 May, did you do or say anything to anyone about those two forms? 
      
     A. Yes, I did. In the course of a conversation, I had a discussion about that form. I had a discussion about that form with the president of PNC. 
      
      
     Q. Who was that? 
      
     A. Sunil Sharma. 
      
      
     Q. Do you remember on what day you had that conversation? 
      
     A. On that particular day, 4 May, the first day of school. 
      
      
     Q. Putting it in words of what you said to him and what he said in return, can you tell us, please, what was said? 
      
     A. In the course of conversation, he goes, ""How did you go with that form?"" I said, ""Yes. I filled out those teacher profile forms. I had the permission to sign, I signed on their behalf."" 
      
      
     Q. So he asked you how you went with the forms. 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. You told him that you-- 
      
     A. That I have signed on their behalf - filled the forms, signed on their behalf and posted to the department.” (T 77) 
    [41] However, the plaintiff said he did not give a copy of these forms to the defendant or to the P&C because the principal was responsible for the teaching staff under the Constitution, and he considered these matters to be staff matters; in addition, some of the information on the form was personal.[42] The plaintiff’s evidence about these conversations was corroborated by the two teachers in question, Mrs Lata and Mrs Shikha Sharma, and it is appropriate to set their evidence out here.The evidence of the two teachers whose signatures had allegedly been forged.[43] Mrs Lata and Mrs Shikha Sharma are both qualified teachers independently of their role as teachers in the school. These two teachers, whose signatures had allegedly been forged, attended court in response to a subpoena (issued by the defendant) and gave evidence on the first day of the trial. They no longer teach at the school. As is set out in more detail below, I have found that they are independent witnesses of the utmost probity. No attack on their credit was made in cross-examination or in submissions, although it was formally put to them that they had not given any authorisation to the plaintiff to sign the forms, a statement both witnesses did not agree with.Mrs Lata’s evidence[44] Mrs Lata, who taught Grade 2, was a qualified teacher who had started teaching at the school earlier in the year. As she was a new teacher, it was necessary for the school to submit a teacher profile form setting out her address and contact details and, most importantly, her qualifications as a teacher, so that these details could be registered with the department. In addition, it was necessary for her to identify, in the “Professional Development Profile 2006”, short courses she would be interested in, as there are departmental courses available for teachers training. (This form was never mentioned either to the plaintiff by the defendant or the P&C, or during the trial.)[45] As Mrs Lata’s information about what she said to both the defendant and the plaintiff is central to the issues in this case, it is important to set it out in full.[46] Mrs Lata’s evidence in chief was: 
     
     “Q. That conversation you had with Mr Shandil, can you remember what was said? 
      
     A. He asked me to help with teacher profile form, to give the like details. 
      
      
     Q. So he asked you to give him some help with filling in a teacher profile form. Is that right? 
      
     A. Yeah.  
      
      
     Q. You understood that to be a teacher profile form for you? Is that right? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Was this because you were a new teacher? 
      
     A. Yeah.  
      
      
     Q. It was? 
      
     A. Yeah.  
      
      
     Q. Did you give him the information that he asked for, for the purpose of the form? 
      
     A. Yeah.  
      
      
     Q. Did he say anything else to you about the form? 
      
     A. Yes. He said that he has to send it as soon as possible, that's why he's doing it over the phone.” (T 55 – 6) 
    [47] She repeated this at T 58: 
     
     “Q. Now, look, that's what he said to you. What did you say to him, if anything? Did you say anything back to him, and if so what? 
      
     A. I help him with filling the forms, like I gave him - he asked me my name and whatever was needed on the form, and at the end I gave him permission to sign it for me.” 
    [48] Mrs Lata repeated this evidence without any concession or alteration in cross-examination: 
     
     “Q. Mrs Lata, you said that during the course of your conversation with Mr Shandil you gave him permission to sign the form on your behalf. 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Is that correct? 
      
     A. Yes. 
      
      
     Q. Mrs Lata, I put to you that in fact you did not give Mr Sharma such permission, did you? 
      
     A. I gave the permission, verbally over the phone. 
      
      
     Q. Mrs Lata, you told her Honour how the conversation went. In that evidence that you gave to her Honour you never said that Mr Sharma asked for your permission. You never said that, did you? 
      
     A. I told that I helped him to fill the form. 
      
      
     Q. You gave evidence I accept that, but you never told her Honour that Mr Sharma asked for your authority or your permission to sign the form in your name. You never said that, did you? 
      
     A. No. 
      
      
     … 
      
      
     Q. Just do the best you can. He asked you what? 
      
     A. That I gave him permission to sign the form for me because I was not able to, you know, get the - I didn't have time to go and fill the form, so I gave him permission to sign it for me.” (T 61) 
    [49] Mrs Lata repeated that while she could not recall what the plaintiff said “I remember I gave him permission” (T 62).[50] Mrs Lata gave the following evidence in chief about how she came to be at the social function the night before the P&C meeting, and about her conversation with the defendant in which he showed her the signed teachers profile form: 
     
     “A. Yes, he said that, “Because you were teaching before, so you deserve to have complimentary ticket,” so he gave me [two tickets]. And I went there [to the concert] and he said that then - he said, “This is a teacher profile form.”” 
    [51] I have stopped at this part of her evidence to note that although the precise date for this conversation between the defendant and Mrs Lata during which he gave her two tickets was not the subject of evidence, it appears to have been several days before the concert; in other words, it occurred at a time when the defendant was already aware of the issues concerning Mrs Lata’s signature.[52] Mrs gave the following evidence in chief concerning her discussion with the defendant, during the concert, about the signature on the teachers profile form: 
     
     “Q. Okay. Now, I think you said Mr Sharma gave that to you on the night? Is that right, that document? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. What did you say to him? When he gave you that document, what did you say to him? 
      
     A. He just ask me, ""Is this your signature?"" And I saw that Teacher Profile File was written on top, so I just signed for him.” (T 60-61) 
    [53] Mrs Lata gave the same evidence in cross-examination: 
     
     “Q. Sorry, let me clarify the question. Was there anybody else present when you had the conversation with my client? 
      
     A. No. 
      
      
     Q. So it was a one-on-one conversation just between the two of you? 
      
     A. Yep. 
      
      
     Q. Are you sure? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. You see, Mrs Lata, I put to you that two other people were present during this conversation. One of whom was Sanjay Singh and the other whom was Shalendra, spelt S-H-A-L-E-N-D-R-A Chand. Do you agree with that? 
      
     A. Because I was only talking to Mr Sharma, I didn't realise that - there were lots of people around but I didn't know that someone is, you know, watching the-- 
      
      
     Q. Mrs Lata, when you have a conversation with someone, and I accept that you may have had family around and it was a function. Mrs Lata, when you have a conversation with someone I put to you, you know who is present. 
      
     A. Like it was lots of crowd, like many people were coming inside and so there was lots of people around us but I didn't realise that there was Shalendra and the other person around. Maybe they were there, but I you know I didn't know their names.” (T 62-63) 
    [54] It was put to Mrs Lata that the defendant asked her if she signed the teacher profile and that her reply was that she did not: 
     
     “Q. Your reply was, ""No, I did not."" Do you recall saying those words, or words to that effect? 
      
     A. Yes, I said.  
      
      
     Q. I put to you my client then said to you, ""Do you know who did sign it?"" Do you recall my client saying that, or words to that effect? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. I put to you that your reply was, ""No, I do not."" Do you recall giving that reply, or a reply to that effect? 
      
     A. Sorry, I didn't understand that.” (T 64) 
    [55] After this question was clarified for her, she denied that the defendant had asked it: 
     
     “Q. The last part of the conversation, the last relevant part of the conversation is that my client said to you, ""Do you know who signed it?"" being the form. Do you recall my client asking you that question? 
      
     A. No.  
      
      
     Q. You're now saying you don't recall my client asking you that question or a question to that effect about who signed the form. 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Did my client ask you any question at all to do with who signed the form? 
      
     A. No.  
      
      
     Q. So he never raised it at all. 
      
     A. No.” (T 65-66) 
    [56] Mrs Lata repeated her description of what happened as follows: 
     
     “Q. Mrs Lata, I put to you that my client asked you if you knew who signed the form. Is that true or not true? 
      
     A. He only said that, ""Is this your signature?"" and he didn't mention who signed it. He didn't say anything. It was few seconds, like I just saw that and just signed it, and then I went inside, and that was it. 
      
      
     Q. I put to you that you said in reply, ""No, I do not,"" namely you do not know who signed the form. Do you admit that or you don't admit that? 
      
     A. I don't understand. 
      
      
     Q. Did you say to my client that you did not know who signed the form? 
      
     A. No.  
      
      
     Q. Did you say any words to that effect of that nature? 
      
     A. No.  
      
      
     Q. Did my client then ask you for a specimen of your signature? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Is that the signature you've put on exhibit C? 
      
     A. Yes.” (T 66)  
    [57] Mrs Lata’s statement that she gave her consent to the plaintiff to write her name on the teacher’s profile form was confirmed by her in writing on 1 December 2008 when she prepared and signed a statement and gave it to the plaintiff. The contents of that statement were as follows: 
     
     “[Mrs Lata’s address] 
      
      
     TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN 
      
      
     I wish to certify that I, Shaireen Lata, grade 2 teacher at the Australian Institute of Hindi Language Studies, gave permission to the Principal, Mr Ashock Shandil, to fill in the “Teacher Profile Form” details and write my name as S. Lata at the bottom of the form. I submitted the requested documents of my qualifications to the Principal as evidence. 
      
      
     [signed] Shaireen Lata 
      
     1/12/08” 
    [58] The plaintiff sent this document to Mr Kumar (Exhibit P) by email dated 2 December 2008. It demonstrates a contemporaneous statement by Mrs Lata. I also note that Mr Kumar then sent it to the defendant, but it made no difference to the defendant’s obdurate attitude. [59] Mrs Lata was not cross-examined about the accuracy of any of the information she gave to the plaintiff so that he could complete the teacher profile form on her behalf. That information was private information which could only have been known to her, and her provision of such personal information to the plaintiff is corroborative of her statement that she was providing him with authorisation not only to fill out the form on her behalf, but to sign it.[60] Mrs Lata is an independent and objective witness. She gave evidence truthfully and did not waver in cross-examination.[61] I accept the evidence of Mrs Lata as a witness of truth both as to her conversation with the plaintiff and with the defendant. [62] The second teacher with whom the defendant had a conversation was Mrs Shikha Sharma.Mrs Shikha Sharma’s evidence[63] Mrs Sharma (who is unrelated to the defendant) taught Grade 5 and had been a teacher with the school for the previous year. Her teacher profile form was essentially an update. Her evidence about her conversation with the plaintiff was as follows: 
     
     “Q. At the end of April 2008, did you have a conversation by telephone with Mr Ashok Shandil? 
      
     A. No, I had a verbal conversation with him. 
      
      
     Q. Verbal conversation? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Do you recall that conversation? 
      
     A. Yes, I do.  
      
      
     Q. Do you remember what he said to you? 
      
     A. Yes, it was the last day of the first term - the last school day. I was waiting for my husband to come and pick me up after school. Myself and Mr Shandil were in discussion about the school, and that is the time he mentioned that there was this teacher profile form that he had to fill in and send to the Department of Education and Training, and he needed information about me to fill in the form. At the moment, he told that he did not have the form with him, and he needed to fill it in and send it to the department as fast as possible. That is the time I said, ""Okay, you can fill in the form for me,"" because he already had my CV with him, and as part of the signature, I told him to write my name and signature on the form on my behalf. 
      
      
     Q. On your behalf? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. So the teacher profile form, you gave him the information because he already had your CV. Is that right? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. You asked him to fill it in for you? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. And to sign your name on your behalf. Is that right? 
      
     A. Yes, use my name. 
      
      
     Q. To use your name on the form. 
      
     A. Yes, to confirm the signature on the form.” (T 44) 
    [64] She adhered to this in cross-examination: 
     
     “Q. To make sure that I've correctly understood your evidence, the evidence I think that you gave to the court was that you said to Mr Shandil that he could complete a form that you hadn't seen. Is that correct? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. And also that he could sign a form on your behalf, again which form you have not seen. 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Is that correct? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Are you sure about that? 
      
     A. Yes.” (T 47-48) 
    [65] Mrs Sharma made it clear in cross-examination she had never suggested the plaintiff had signed without her authority (T 48 line 45 to T 49 line 14; T 50 line 22 to T 51 line 2; T 52 lines 40-50; and T 53 line 43 to T 54 line 6). Mrs Sharma adhered to this evidence in cross-examination, and I particularly note: 
     
     “Q. Is it your practice, Mrs Sharma, to authorise people to sign documents that you've not seen? 
      
     A. It is not my practice. He told me it was a teacher profile form, and he just had to put in my name and details. I thought it was not a legal binding or a legal form which could affect me. So I just said, ""Just put my name as part of signature on the form."" 
      
      
     Q. You see, I put to you, Mrs Sharma, that any conversation you had with Mr Shandil about the completion of the form did not take place in April 2008. 
      
     A. It did take place in 2008. 
      
      
     Q. I put to you, Mrs Sharma, that it would be unacceptable for you to agree to authorise someone to sign a form in your name and which you have not seen. 
      
     A. He was the school principal. I trusted him, and I just gave him authority to do it on my behalf.” (T 48) 
    [66] She explained the circumstances in which she later added her signature and some words to this form, which occurred after the plaintiff’s dismissal and departure from the school, as follows: 
     
     “Q. Mrs Sharma, when you wrote the words at the foot of the form, you didn't include, did you, any words to the effect that ""The signature above is not mine, but I authorised Mr Shandil to sign that signature,"" did you? 
      
     A. Yes, but I received a phone conversation after Mr Sharma from Mr Sanjay Singh. He was the school treasurer. I don't know if he was employed or not. That is the time he mentioned that my signature on the form was not correct. I was pursuing a career in teaching, and if my signature on this teacher profile form contradicts with the signature with the Department of Education, I will be in problem, and I had to give him my proper signature so that he could forward to the department. So at that particular moment, the only issue in my mind was to give the proper signature so that it could be provided to the Department of Education. I had no idea whatsoever the conflict between Mr Shandil and Mr Sharma. 
      
      
     Q. Mrs Sharma, is what you're now saying that at the time that you wrote these words, you did not know that there was an argument about whether or not Mr Shandil had your authorisation to sign your name? Were you aware of that dispute when you signed these words or were you not aware of it? 
      
     A. I was aware I had given him authority to sign the form. 
      
      
     … 
      
      
     Q. Mrs Sharma, these words at the foot of the teacher profile form, I think you said your evidence was that you signed these towards the end of 2008 or at the beginning of 2009. 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Is that correct? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. You wrote these words following a telephone call from someone. 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Is that correct? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Who made the telephone call to you? 
      
     A. Mr Sanjay Singh. 
      
      
     Q. I'm sorry, who is Mr Sanjay Singh? 
      
     A. He was the treasurer of the school. 
      
      
     Q. What did Mr Sanjay Singh say to you that led to your writing these words on the form? 
      
     A. He said to me that they had this teacher profile form, they had to submit it to the Department of Education, and the signature on the teacher profile form was not mine. So I have to come in and give my profile signature so that they could forward it to the Department of Education and Training. 
      
      
     Q. Then I assume that you went in. 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. That's when you wrote these words. 
      
     A. Yes.” (T 48-49) 
    [67] Mrs Sharma made it clear throughout her cross-examination she had never suggested the plaintiff had signed without her authority (T 48 line 45 to T 49 line 14; T 50 line 22 to T 51 line 2; T 52 lines 40-50; and T 53 line 43 to T 54 line 6). She also indicated that she had made it clear to the defendant after the P&C meeting when, in late 2008 or early 2009, he had contacted her by telephone and put to her that her signature had been forged by the plaintiff. She told the court his request that she sign the form was couched in terms of a threat to her teaching career if she forwarded a “wrong signature” to the Department: 
     
     “Q. Mrs Sharma, did my client telephone you? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Could you please tell the court, as best as you can recall, what my client said to you when he called you and what your response was? 
      
     A. He called me and he told me that there was this teacher profile form ""and Mr Shandil had forged your signature on the form"". I told him that, yes, I told Mr Shandil to use my name as signature on the form. During that conversation he mentioned that I was pursuing a career in teaching and I had forwarded a wrong signature to the Department of Education and Training, and therefore my signature there was incorrect. 
      
      
     … 
      
      
     Q. What did you understand he was trying to suggest to you with those words? 
      
     A. The only thing I thought at that moment was that I gave a - my signature was incorrect. I was pursuing a career in teaching. If my signature over there is incorrect, it gives a bit of a wrong name to me in the teaching field. So I had to give a proper signature so that they could forward it to the Department of Education and Training. 
      
      
     Q. And that belief was based upon what Mr Sharma told you in that telephone call? Is that right? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Until that point in time you had no concern in that regard. Is that right? 
      
     A. Yes.” (T 53-54) 
    [68] Mrs Shikha Sharma was, I find, a witness whose objectivity, independence and honesty were such that her evidence can be relied upon. I note that although the defendant told her he had to post these revised forms to the department, there is no evidence he ever did so.[69] What happened after the plaintiff originally posted these forms to the department in May 2008 and (according to his evidence)? He told the defendant not only that he had posted these, but that he had obtained their authority to sign the forms because of the looming deadline. What did the plaintiff and defendant do between May and November 2008 and when (and why) did their relationship change?The plaintiff’s role in the school between April and 30 November 2008[70] Between April and November 2008 the school continued to function in the same way as it had beforehand. The annual school magazine was prepared, and its contents show a happy group of parents, children and teachers. The annual concert was to take place on the last day of the school term (29 November 2008), and it would appear that friction over control of this event was the real trigger for the problems between the plaintiff and the P&C.[71] The school concert on 29 November involved preparation by the plaintiff, the other teachers and the students for musical numbers and other entertainment on the night. The parents of the students played an important role in relation to this concert. Tickets were sold to raise money for the school, although Mrs Lata, one of the two teachers whose teacher profile form was signed by the plaintiff, was given two tickets to the concert that night as a gift.[72] At the 16 November 2008 there was an argument between the plaintiff and the P&C, and he walked out of the meeting. As is set out in more details below, the P&C members were very angry about this conduct, which was considered “inappropriate, out of character and grossly insulting” according to the defendant’s email to the plaintiff the next day (Exhibit M). The defendant thought his opinion to this effect was so important that he later circulated a copy of this email at the school meeting in February 2009.[73] What led to the plaintiff walking out of the meeting? This did not emerge with any clarity from the evidence, but some clues as to the answer may be found in the copy of the extract of the plaintiff’s email in reply to the defendant (Exhibit M), which the defendant circulated to the parents (on the same page as the defendant’s email, immediately below), as being the plaintiff’s explanation for his conduct: 
     
     “parents [sic] that approached you should already know that it is the teachers that prepare items and the P&C president has no idea about these things or maybe you told them something different! I think it is very important for you to educate some members of your committee about the P&C constitution and the perimeters within which you are supposed to be working. I am glad I had the foresight to see that a day would come when the P&C President would actually feel that he/she is “running” the school, and I did my best to see that the position of the Principal is secure.” 
    [74] The minutes of meeting of 30 November 2008, listing the grounds upon which the plaintiff’s services were terminated, refers to this email at paragraph 5, but the real key is in the section on general business, where his walking out is referred to in detail. The problem was, as the plaintiff had indicated in his email, that the program for the Annual Presentation Night concert had been decided upon by the teachers, and the plaintiff was “unable to comply” (according to the minutes) with a request by the P&C to provide the concert program layout. As a result the program layout “was not discussed with the P&C Executive Committee and no one knew what they were doing” (Minutes, Exhibit 6).[75] Although other claims are set out as a basis for dissatisfaction concerning the plaintiff’s conduct as principal, it is clear, from the defendant’s selection of this part of the plaintiff’s email for distribution to the parents when there was a school meeting to discuss the sacking that the plaintiff’s wrongdoing was that he would not let the P&C “settle”(to use the legal word) the concert program, because this had been done by the teachers. The P&C members wanted to have control over the program (I note, from the 2009 school magazine, that the annual concert photographs for the following year show the defendant and other P&C members playing an increased role by presenting prizes and the like) and the plaintiff had told them this was the teacher’s job.[76] While this may have been a matter for indignation by the members of the P&C (especially since the plaintiff had walked out of the meeting and said the defendant should “educate” the P&C about their role in the school’s activities), the P&C did not seek to have the plaintiff dismissed or sacked for this reason. In or around 20 November 2008, the defendant made inquiries of the department about whether the P&C had the power to remove the plaintiff as principal, without identifying why, either to the department or to the plaintiff, who knew nothing about this email. However, although he emailed the plaintiff to complain about his behaviour at the 16 November P&C meeting, he carefully kept his inquiries about this, and about signatures on the teachers’ profile forms, to himself.[77] Another contentious issue between the plaintiff and defendant was that the P&C wanted to combine the classes for years 5 and 6, which would save approximately $2,000. The 30 November minutes complain that the P&C had “no feedback” from the plaintiff about this. It would appear that the P&C wanted to involve itself in the teaching administration side of the school, in the interests of reducing the costs to parents (I note from the 2009 school magazine that these steps were in fact taken, and the $100 per week salary claimed by the plaintiff was not paid to the new principal, who performed his role in 2009 without payment). Neither this issue, nor the concert program issue were, however, ever raised as grounds for dismissal of the plaintiff. Again, although the P&C was prepared to complain about not receiving feedback from the plaintiff about this issue, no feedback was sought about the teacher profile forms.[78] Between 20 November, when the defendant was making these inquiries, and 30 November, when the meeting was held at which the plaintiff was sacked, the defendant never contacted the plaintiff to ask about the teacher profile forms. The defendant claimed he saw the plaintiff at the school concert, at which the defendant spoke to Mrs Lata about whether she had signed the teacher profile form but the plaintiff said he was busy. The plaintiff’s evidence was that the defendant did not speak to him during the concert. The first he knew about the allegation was when he was called to the P&C meeting on 30 November 2008. As to the defendant’s claim that the plaintiff said he was too busy to speak, it was hardly an appropriate way to discuss such a topic. The failure of the defendant to raise such a serious matter with the plaintiff prior to 30 November is extraordinary.[79] The agenda for this meeting (Exhibit L) gives no clue of any proposed motion to dismiss the principal. No motion was circulated beforehand, nor were copies of any documents provided to the P&C members beforehand, nor was legal advice obtained (contrary to the particular of truth to this effect, which was withdrawn during the trial).[80] The issue of the teacher profile form was not the first item on the agenda; there was a lot of discussion about the concert the night before. According to the minutes (the text of which is set out below) Mr Kuldip Narayan made a long speech before the plaintiff came into the room. These statements, as set out in the minutes, include a claim that as a result of his refusal to collaborate with parents, “most of the parents have indicated to pull out their child from year 2009”, that the plaintiff was “not willing to listen to parents inputs on some useful advice”, that the school was going to lose “lots of financial support”, and that: 
     
     “ In doing so, he personally moved a motion to P&C Committee to take appropriate action against the principal for the betterment of our school.” (Exhibit 6. page 5, point 5) 
    [81] The Minutes go on to note that Mr Narayan “also” requested the principal explain his stance on the forgery issue, and ask him to step down “to avoid dreadful repetition of school and community in general”. It was then decided to put this to a vote and all members present in the meeting voted in favour of the motion. The minutes go on to note that Mr Sanjay Singh then went to call the Principal “to explain to P&C Executive Committee regarding forgery issue [sic]” and that the plaintiff “came to the meeting at 2.47 pm”. [82] Was the vote taken before the plaintiff actually came to the meeting? The minutes appear to say so, but the question was never precisely put in cross-examination. I have dealt with this issue in more detail below.[83] The minutes go on to note that he was given the opportunity to resign but declined and that the committee had no option but to terminate his employment with immediate effect. He was told this on the spot, and ordered to return all school property by 4 p.m. to Mr Patrick Chand. An acting principal was appointed at 3.05pm. The plaintiff’s evidence of what occurred at the meeting makes no reference to any vote being taken while he was there.[84] This brings me to a consideration of just what was said to the plaintiff by the defendant at this meeting, and whether the matter complained of was published. I shall first consider the evidence of the plaintiff.The plaintiff’s evidence as to what was said at the meeting[85] Mr Goldsmith, for the defendant, cross-examined the plaintiff as to what had occurred during the 30 November meeting (at T 154-155): 
     
     “Q. Mr Shandil, if I can take you to your attendance at the meeting on 30 November. What time, approximately, did you actually attend the committee meeting? 
      
     A. It would have been almost after two hours. Roughly, 20 to, quarter to 2 - quarter to 3, sorry. 
      
      
     Q. Around about 2.45? 
      
     A. Well, plus or minus. More towards the minus side, I suppose. 
      
      
     Q. I put to you, Mr Shandil, a conversation took place to the following fact. The defendant said to you, ""Ashok, the committee is considering whether or not two teacher profile forms were forged. What do you have to say about that?"" 
      
     A. When did the defendant say that? 
      
      
     Q. When you attended at the meeting, at about 2.45, more or less. 
      
     A. You mean directly he showed me just one form although I heard him say when I entered and he was addressing other people that Mr Shandil has forged the signatures-- 
      
      
     … 
      
      
     GOLDSMITH 
      
      
     Q. And I put to you Mr Shandil, your response was as follows, ""yes I signed the forms, I know it was illegal, I signed the forms to meet the deadline so we could get the school grant."" 
      
     A. That's incorrect. 
      
      
     Q. You didn't say that? 
      
     A. (no verbal reply) 
      
      
     Q. And I put to you the defendant then said to you, ""It appears the committee considers that to be misconduct and insubordination, what do you have to say about that?"" Did he say that to you? 
      
     A. He did say that to me. 
      
      
     Q. And I put to you that your reply was that you said, ""what can you guys do about it?"" Did you say that? 
      
     A. What - no, I didn't say that. 
      
      
     Q. You didn't say that. And I put to you that after you said that you started to walk out of the meeting. Did you do that? 
      
     A. That's incorrect.  
      
      
     Q. And I put to you that as you started to walk out of the meeting, the defendant said to you, ""I think we would like you to resign as principal, are you willing to do so?"" 
      
     A. That's incorrect. 
      
      
     Q. I put to you that your reply was, ""No, I'm not."" 
      
     A. That's incorrect. 
      
      
     Q. You didn't say that? 
      
     A. (No verbal reply)” 
    [86] However, what was put to the plaintiff in cross-examination appears to be a different version of events from what the defendant said in examination in chief (at T 269-270): 
     
     “A. During the course of the meeting - and then somebody else suggested - somebody in the committee suggested that somebody should again go and call the principal to the meeting, and Sanjay Singh again went and requested him to come to the meeting.  
      
      
     Q. I think you've already said that. What happened next?  
      
     A. The principal, Mr Shandil, did come to the meeting at about quarter to 3.  
      
      
     Q. When he came to the meeting was there any conversation?  
      
     A. Yes, when he came to the meeting at that time we had moved to the foyer - from the hall, we had moved to the second part, and there wasn't much area available but members did make a space available for him and I requested him, I said, ""Master, come and sit down."" He said, ""No. It's all right. Fine with me."" Then-- 
      
      
     … 
      
      
     Q. Sorry, what happened, or what was said, next?  
      
     A. During the meeting, like, one of the issues that was discussed is the teacher profile form. So the members felt it was a very important issue that the principal come and answer their questions like who had written the form and who had signed the form. So when Mr Shandil came in I asked Mr Shandil, ""Do you know who filled in this form?"" He said - he looked at the form and said, ""Yes, I did. I know who filled it."" I said, ""Who filled it?"" He said, ""I did it,"" replying that Mr Shandil had done it. And I asked him, ""Who signed it?"" He said he signed it. 
      
      
     Q. Was anything further said? 
      
     A. We asked him that did he know that it was-- 
      
      
     [Objection] 
      
      
     GOLDSMITH 
      
      
     Q. Who spoke the words? If you spoke the words, can you please say ""I said"", and if someone else said it, say someone else, and if you can identify the other person, please do so.  
      
     A. I asked him that this forms were sent to the Community Language Studies with the view for us to get the grant. He said, ""Yes, I know. What you guys going to do about it?"" Then we had a discussion in the meeting. The meeting continued.” 
    [87] Apart from being very different to the version of the conversation put to the plaintiff, this version makes no reference whatever to any allegation of forgery.[88] The plaintiff said that at the meeting he was given a letter (Exhibit K) and told that if he resigned he would not be sacked. The contents of this letter are instructive: 
     
     “Dear Mr Shandil, 
      
      
     The Parents and Citizens Association of the Australian Institute of Hindi Language Studies at its Executive Meeting on the 30th November has unanimously decided that the association will no longer need your services from the end of the year 2008. 
      
      
     The P&C acknowledges the invaluable contribution made by you over the years. The school has grown enormously and the Hindi speaking community has benefited a lot from this. 
      
      
     Please hand in all school and association property in your possession to the Vice President, Mr Navin Chand. 
      
      
     The P&C takes this opportunity to thank you for your contribution and wishes you the best in your future endeavours. 
      
      
     Yours Sincerely, 
      
     Sunil Sharma 
      
     (President)” 
    [89] I now consider the evidence of the defendant, who denied ever using the word “forgery” and denied giving the plaintiff the 30 November 2008 letter at the meeting.The defendant’s version of events[90] The defendant described matters similar to those raised by Mr Kuldip Narayan (as outlined in the minutes) being discussed by the P&C prior to the plaintiff coming into the room, and after the plaintiff arrived. He sought to give evidence that it was only after the plaintiff arrived that the motion by Mr Kuldip Narayan was put, the inference being that the plaintiff was in the room at the time.[91] Mr Rasmussen objected to this evidence, on the basis that it had not been put to the plaintiff or to the witness from the P&C whom he called, Mrs Singh. I struck out the summary of what was asserted to have been said by Mr Kuldip Narayan (whom I note was not called as a witness), and heard the evidence of what the defendant said happened while the plaintiff was present, but under objection (at T 271). Another problem was that the minutes had not been tendered, and it appeared that the formal signed version had not been discovered (T 272). The following occurred at T 272: 
     
     “HER HONOUR: What page of the cross-examination is that on, please? Well, looking at MFI 6, I can't see anything in here about Mr Narayan moving a motion. Mr Goldsmith? 
      
      
     GOLDSMITH: Your Honour, I don't think it's in - I don't think there's a reference to the motion-- 
      
      
     HER HONOUR: But that's just basic meeting procedure. If somebody moves a motion you note that a motion has been moved and somebody seconded it and then you record that the motion has been passed. 
      
      
     GOLDSMITH: Your Honour, I can only address what's in the document-- 
      
      
     HER HONOUR: The real problem is this hasn't been put. What page do you say this was put to the plaintiff; what page of the transcript? 
      
      
     GOLDSMITH: Which aspect, your Honour? 
      
      
     HER HONOUR: All of it, in relation to - all that I've just heard about in the plaintiff's presence, this motion being moved and seconded and voted unanimously when - I don't think this was put to Mrs Singh. 
      
      
     GOLDSMITH: The question of the motion was not contemplated. 
      
      
     HER HONOUR: Or to Mrs Singh. Isn't that right? 
      
      
     GOLDSMITH: Or to Mrs Singh. 
      
      
     HER HONOUR: Yes, I see, well, why should this gentleman be able to give that evidence now? 
      
      
     GOLDSMITH: I can't say anything against that proposition. 
      
      
     HER HONOUR: In that case, we should strike out all this evidence, should we not? It will all have to go.” (T 272 – 3) 
    [92] This was one of a number of areas of evidence where the defendant’s failure to provide particulars of truth created problems, as Mr Rasmussen stated at T 273, adding that he had raised the defendant’s failure to provide particulars of truth from the start of the trial.[93] The defendant went on to give evidence that tends to support the position in the minutes, namely that the committee did not make a decision in the plaintiff’s presence after hearing from the plaintiff, but that the plaintiff was told the committee had made the decision, and that the only question was whether he would accept the opportunity to resign or be sacked: 
     
     “Q. Mr Sharma, what was said next or what happened next? 
      
     A. Up to that, Mr Shandil was advised that - he was given the opportunity to resign from the position of the principal. 
      
      
     Q. Can you say, recalling as best you can, exactly who said what? 
      
     A. After the committee had made the decision, I advised Mr Sandil that the committee has made a decision that he has to - he has the opportunity to resign from the post of the principal. 
      
      
     Q. Did Mr Shandil say anything? 
      
     A. He said that he's not going to resign. 
      
      
     Q. Did anything happen after that; anything said or anything done? 
      
     A. He tried to walk out of the meeting, but then the meeting continued and then the decision was made that the position of the principal will be terminated from 30 November, since that was the last day of the school. So in 2009 we will not need him anymore. He was informed verbally and then a letter was posted to him. 
      
      
     Q. We'll just leave the letter for the moment. Was anything else said or done in the meeting whilst Mr Shandil was there? 
      
     A. No. 
      
      
     Q. And what happened to Mr Shandil? 
      
     A. After that Mr Shandil walked out of the meeting and then he was in the school premises. When the school ended at 4 o'clock, he was there until 4 o'clock, and then he left after 4.00 and then he closed the gates.” (T 274) 
    When was the motion put to sack the plaintiff?[94] On this version of events, the resolution to sack the plaintiff did not occur before the plaintiff came, but in circumstances where the plaintiff “tried to walk out” but the meeting continued and the resolution was then passed, presumably in his absence. However, at T 277, when asked whether anything else happened after the plaintiff left the meeting, he said that “nothing happened”.[95] It was not put to the plaintiff that any resolution was taken while he was in the room, and the most likely explanation, given this variety of explanations, is that the resolution to sack the plaintiff was passed before he was called in to give his side of the story. In other words, it would not have mattered what the plaintiff said; the P&C intended to sack him whatever explanation he had.When was the letter given to the plaintiff?[96] The defendant says that the letter was posted to the plaintiff. The first problem is that the plaintiff showed this letter to Mr Narayan, the school solicitor, later on in the afternoon of 30 November. I accept the evidence of Mr Narayan on this issue. The second, and bigger, problem is that the contents of the letter are wholly inconsistent with the plaintiff having been sacked for misconduct, let alone for a matter as serious as forgery.[97] The contents of Exhibit K are consistent with the plaintiff’s version of what happened at the meeting; he was told he could resign, with the inducement of this friendly letter thanking him for his services over the years, or he would be sacked. Although he chose the latter option, he left with this letter in his hand.[98] I have dealt with other issues concerning the defendant’s evidence in the section of this judgment following a summary of what the other members of the P&C who were called gave evidence was said.[99] A considerable amount of the time taken in this trial was taken up by the evidence of witnesses who denied that any of the words complained of were spoken by the defendant, or anyone else, at all. However, a helpful guide as to what was said at this meeting, at least from the defendant’s point of view, can be gained by setting out what was recorded in the P&C Minutes.The minutes of the P&C meeting[100] The first source from which I draw information about these events is the minutes of the meeting. All the defendant’s witnesses said that these minutes were correct, so this should provide support for the defendant’s version of what was said.[101] The relevant portion in the 30 November Minutes noted: 
     
     “President tried to contact Ashok Shandil (principal) on three separate occasions (one at 1.31pm, second at 1.43pm and third at 2.12pm) during meeting hours to discuss some key issues in front of the P&C executive committee but his phone rang out on all occasions. Some of the main issues include: 
      
      
     (a) signing teacher profile forms without teacher consent; 
      
      
     (b) complaints received from parents regarding his unprincipled approach; 
      
      
     (c) cost cutting measures to be implemented for 2009 regarding school management; 
      
      
     (d) misleading P&C executive committee on school curriculum and teacher qualification criteria for community language studies; 
      
      
     (e) discuss his personal attitude problem with P&C executive committee, i.e. walking out of meeting forum every year and does not want to work closely with P&C executive committee; 
      
      
     (f) unfairness on some parents and holding personal grudges; 
      
      
     (g) valuable inputs conveyed by parents is always impractical; 
      
      
     (h) pretending to be very busy and not willing to teach a class; 
      
      
     (i) not willing to disclose program details to P&C executive committee for annual presentation night; 
      
      
     (j) calling P&C executive committee uneducated to work with; and 
      
      
     (k) school fundraising activities getting costly and generally coming out from individual parent’s pocket.” 
    [102] I note that none of these matters, apart from (a), was ever raised, in the justification defence, as grounds warranting the dismissal of the plaintiff. All of the evidence before me is that the school was happy and harmonious for many years, in addition to being well-run. The petition signed by 39 parents dated 9 January 2009 (Exhibit M) speaks glowingly of the plaintiff and describes the events of 30 November 2008 as taking them “by surprise and shock”.[103] The events of 16 November were described in more detail in the 30 November Minutes: 
     
     “1. School Principal acknowledged to the member, Sanjay singh [sic] was not present in the meeting due to some dissatisfaction with President in conjunction with previous P&C Executive Committee meeting where he simply walked out of the meeting. President advised the P&C Executive Committee that he requested some clarification on school matters which, the principal was unable to comply with such as: 
      
      
       
      a) Program layout for Annual Presentation Nite held on 30th November 2008. Program layout was not discussed with the P&C Executive Committee and no one knew what they were doing. 
       
       
      b) Complaints received from a parent on 28/10/08 regarding a staff member. Few complaints received against the same staff member but no feedback was given by the principal despite repeated requests to the P&C Executive Committee as to what action has been taken against him. 
       
       
      c) School Curriculum which, was complied and prepared by Mr. Jai Singh was the only one at the Department of NSW Community Languages School, in our school file. Ashok Shandil told the P&C Executive Committee that he has done all the hard work for the school to prepare the curriculum, which is a secret document. 
      
      
     2. Teacher Profile Form for Shaireen Lata which, the President found out that principal forged her signature. This, the P&C Executive Committee felt improper and very unethical behavior demonstrated by the principal. The P&C Executive Committee was also reliably informed that the principal had forged Sikha Sharma’s signature as well. The P&C Executive Committee requested the President to act on this matter as soon as possible and advise them on potential outcome to avoid any possible impediment from the Department of NSW Community Languages Studies regarding school grants. 
      
      
     3. Presentation Nite did not come up with full expectation as initially expected. Even though the quality of stage performance were brilliant but organization was very poor as lots of parents complained about the sitting arrangements, serving and timing of dinner, distribution of trophies, timing of stage performance in which parents have to stand in queue for preparation. Parents had expressed dissatisfaction about not being provided the program in advance as they are directly involved in their children’s items. Some last minute additions were made which drag along the core function of the nite [sic] making it more tedious and unpleasant. 
      
      
     4. Letter of Complaint from Kuldip Narayan, Shalendra Kumar and Praveen Kumar regarding sale of ticket. 15 Tickets were issued to each financial member twice a year for which majority of them has been paid from their own pockets. These members have personally contributed immensely towards all school functions and have kindly requested the P&C Executive Committee to look for some alternate ways to raise funds just to ease financial burden on all parents concerned. The P&C Executive Committee have agreed with the suggestion and will meet early again in 2009 to discuss this matter with the parents and view some constructive thoughts to generate funds for school operations. 
      
      
     5. Mr Kuldip Narayan mentioned that Ashok Shandil (Principal) does not collaborate with some parents during school season and most of the parents have indicated to pullout their child from year 2009. Numerous parents repeatedly complain about his personal attitude. He is self centered and not willing to listen to parents inputs on some useful advice. According to Kuldip, theses sorts [sic] behaviors are unwarranted which, undermines the mutual relationships between parents and the P&C Committees. This can also dampen the goodwill gesture supported by our Indian community in general towards our Hindi language school. In addition, we could also lose lots of financial support from business community and dedicated individuals who have been the cornerstone of school as well. Kuldip suggested that it is high time that P&C Committee must maintain its standard, create strategies to bring back that confidence amongst parents and likewise, to create a friendly school environment motto that is enjoyed by parents, students and teachers on all occasion solely to promote our Hindi language. In doing so, he personally moved a motion to P&C Committee to take appropriate action against the principal for the betterment of our school. He also requested the principal to explain his stance on the forgery issue as many parents are doubting his professional and personal integrity over the years and, or ask him to step down from his position to avoid dreadful repetition of school and community in general which, the P&C Committee have mutually agreed and supported. It was decided to put to vote and all members present in the meeting voted in favour of the motion. 
      
      
     6. Mr Sanjay Singh went to call the Principal to explain to P&C Executive Committee regarding forgery issue. Principal came to the meeting at 2.47pm. He confirmed that he had signed the form and acknowledged that it was illegal. In addition, he mentioned the reason he signed the form is to meet the deadline for the submission of school grant. Furthermore, he was also made aware of the operational changes for 2009 and numerous complaints received against him and a class teacher. The P&C Executive Committee requested him to explain his stance on his unprofessional misconduct and insubordination. He simply said “what can you guys do” and without fully addressing the issues to the P&C Executive Committee he began to walk out of the meeting. He was agitated and became defensive when questioned and was abrasive in the meeting. The P&C Executive Committee members gave him the opportunity to resign from the post of the principal, which he declined. In regards with his attitude towards the P&C Executive Committee, the committee felt that appropriate measures need to be undertaken for the betterment of school. In consideration, the P&C Executive Committee had no option but to terminate his employment with immediate effect. Mr Ashok Shandil was verbally informed by the President that his services as the Principal is no longer required and a written letter with this regard will be forwarded to him by registered post. Mr Shandil was advised to return all school properties held by him to Patrick Chand by 4pm. 
      
      
     7. P&C Committee appointed Senior Teacher Mr Rishi Karan as Acting Principal at 3.05pm. Mr Rishi Karan accepted the position until P&C Committee finds a suitable person to take up the position in 2009. P&C Committee will hand a letter of appointment to Mr Rishi Karan in due course. 
      
      
     8. P&C Committee briefly explained the change in leadership to the teachers. P&C Committee will also advise the changes to: 
      
     > Principal of Rooty Hill High School 
      
     > Department of NSW Community Language Studies 
      
      
     10. [sic] Subsequent to the termination of School Principal’s services, the P&C Executive Committee have also ceased the services of Legal Advisor, Mr. Uday Narayan. P&C Executive Committee felt that he would be acting acrimoniously against them in regards to Ashok Shandil’s matters. Mr. Narayan was Mr Ashok Shandil’s personal friend and his advise always favoured Mr Ashok Shandil. Whenever consulted for legal issues for the school, Mr Narayan failed to provide the necessary legal information to the P&C committee. The P&C Executive Committee also considers Mr Narayan’s opinion at times is generally prejudiced. Mr Narayan will be made known of the decision of P&C Executive Committee in writing regarding his termination and a letter will be posted to him via registered mail. There will be no replacement for Legal Advisor position at this juncture however, the P&C Executive Committee will decide as to whom to appoint to carry out all legal matters for the school. 
      
      
     11. [sic] There was no other business and meeting concluded at 3.18pm. 
      
      
     Shalendra Chand 
      
     Assistant Secretary” 
    The evidence of members of other members of the P&C[104] Members of the P&C called to give evidence contradicted the contents of the Minutes, each other and, occasionally, themselves. I shall consider the evidence of each of them in turn. [105] There is one feature of this evidence to note. There is no evidence of any inquiry by any of these witnesses concerning the teacher profile forms, or of the relodging of the forms when they were signed by the two teachers at the request of the defendant, or of any other communication with the department by any member of the P&C, before publication of the matter complained of, or afterwards. The sole document in evidence from the department is the email dated 20 November 2008 from Louise Shortus to the defendant, the text of which is as follows: 
     
     “Dear Mr Sharma, 
      
      
     Thank you for your phone call this morning enquiring about the status of the Management Committee of the community languages school operated by your organisation. Natasha Post, the Manager of the NSW Community Languages Schools Program, has advised that the Parents and Citizens Association is also the Management Committee of the school. 
      
      
     With regard to your question regarding the Principal of the school, the P and C has the power to appoint or remove the staff of the school as the school belongs to the P and C. However, the school’s constitution should first be consulted in this regard in case the wording of the constitution prohibits this action. 
      
      
     I hope the above information is helpful.” (Exhibit T) 
    [106] From the text of this letter, it is clear that at the time of his telephone call on 20 November, the defendant was wanting to know if the P&C could sack the plaintiff. Yet, as the evidence of every person called from the P&C shows, nobody else on the P&C knew about the allegations against the plaintiff until shortly after the commencement of the meeting on 30 November 2008. Mrs Doreen Singh[107] Mrs Singh was called by the plaintiff. She was a comparatively new member of the P&C and was always late to the meetings because of work commitments (T 210). She did, however, arrive before the discussion of the events the subject of these proceedings, and recalled the P&C having to move because of the school’s final day activities to another room. It was in this room that the conversation between the plaintiff and defendant took place. [108] Her evidence as to what was said was: 
     
     “A. I can remember Mr Sharma saying that Mr Shandil has signed one of the teacher's name on the teacher's profile form. 
      
      
     RASMUSSEN 
      
      
     Q. Did he say anything else about that form? 
      
     A. It was an - yeah, it was an illegal act of doing - might have been forgery. 
      
      
     HER HONOUR 
      
      
     Q. So, ""It was an illegal act,"" and - just say that again. I missed it. 
      
     A. Might - might - he might have said forgery. 
      
      
     RASMUSSEN 
      
      
     Q. That's right. Mrs Singh, we understand that was a long time ago so just do the best you can. Was Mr Shandil present? 
      
     A. Yes, because I remember Mr Sharma asking him whether it was his handwriting or not. 
      
      
     Q. When he asked him whether it was handwriting or not, was Mr Sharma showing anything - a document or anything like that? 
      
     A. Well, Mr Shandil did admit that it was his handwriting. 
      
      
     Q. But was he showing a document? 
      
     A. Who, Mr Shandil or-- 
      
      
     Q. Mr Sharma. Was he pointing to a document or something like that? 
      
     A. I think he had a form which - yeah, he did have a form, I think. Yeah. I'm not quite sure but I think-- 
      
      
     … 
      
      
     Q. When Mr Sharma said those things about the handwriting on that document, I think you said that Mr Shandil said that it was his handwriting. Is that right? 
      
     A. Yes. 
      
      
     Q. Did he say anything else, Mr Shandil? Did he say anything else? 
      
     A. He said he did it with the consent of that teacher. 
      
      
     Q. Did Mr Sharma say anything at all or anything else about that document or Mr Shandil to the committee at the time? 
      
     A. I can't remember much but I know he did say it was an illegal thing to do. 
      
      
     HER HONOUR 
      
      
     Q. Which ""he"" is that? 
      
     A. It was an illegal thing-- 
      
      
     Q. Who said that? 
      
     A. Mr Sharma. 
      
      
     Q. Mr Sharma said that? He said-- 
      
     A. Yeah. 
      
      
     Q. --it was an illegal act. 
      
     A. Yeah. 
      
      
     Q. Anything else? 
      
     A. (No verbal reply)  
      
      
     RASMUSSEN 
      
      
     Q. Do you remember him saying anything else? 
      
     A. That further complaint should be made. 
      
      
     Q. Further complaint should be made? 
      
     A. On - yeah, because, as the principal, Mr Shandil should not have done that. 
      
      
     Q. Did he say to whom the further complaint should be made? 
      
     A. Can't remember that actually. Who - to whom, but-- 
      
      
     Q. When Mr Sharma said these things there were other committee members present? 
      
     A. Yes. 
      
      
     Q. Do you remember who was present on that day? 
      
     A. Because I was very new to the committee, so I can't really remember everyone's name, but I know by face a couple of people. Yeah.” (T 213 – 214) 
    [109] Mrs Singh was shown the minutes of the meeting, and confirmed that she received these (T 216) and that they were prepared by Mr Virendra Singh. [110] In cross-examination Mrs Singh said she could hear clearly, but that she was concentrating on her daughter, who was in one of the classes at the school (T 219). She only attended one more meeting of the P&C after these events.[111] Although Mrs Singh appeared both reluctant and nervous about giving evidence, she adhered to her statements in cross-examination: 
     
     “Q. Ms Singh, you gave evidence before when my friend was asking you questions that you heard Mr Shandil say that he signed the form with the consent of the teacher. 
      
     A. Right. 
      
      
     Q. Do you recall was that the case? Is that what was said? 
      
     A. Yes. 
      
      
     Q. Mr Shandil said that? 
      
     A. Yes. 
      
      
     Q. Are you sure? 
      
     A. Yes. 
      
      
     Q. Because I have to put to you that that was not said. 
      
     A. Well, I know he admitted it. He said that it was his handwriting. 
      
      
     Q. He admitted that he signed the form. 
      
     A. On the particular teacher's consent.  
      
      
     HER HONOUR 
      
      
     Q. But you weren't asked about that. You were asked whether you were sure that he said that he signed the form with the consent of the teacher. So you were asked if you were sure he said that. So are you sure he said that? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     GOLDSMITH 
      
      
     Q. And you heard that very clearly, did you? 
      
     A. Yes.” (T 221 – 222) 
    [112] The defendant made a sustained attack on the evidence of Mrs Singh, and I set out my findings in relation to these matters: 
     
     (a) Mrs Singh was “clearly a confused witness” (written submissions paragraph 35)  
      
      
     The defendant does not identify with precision the matters about which Mrs Singh was confused. She was less confused than other witnesses, and her evidence was not internally inconsistent or contradictory. 
      
      
     (b) Mrs Singh was in and out of the meeting on “maybe 3 occasions” for about 10 minutes time. While there is no evidence that she was out of the room when the relevant conversations occurred it is submitted that this would “inevitably” have led to a “lack of focus”, since Mrs Singh said she was thinking of her daughter.  
      
      
     Mrs Singh’s evidence of what occurred relates to the period of time when she was in the room. The fact that she arrived late and was absent on other occasions does not detract from the fact that she was present when the plaintiff was called into the room, heard what was said, and was able to describe it in her evidence. 
      
      
     (c) Mrs Singh said she could not remember Mr Sanjay Singh saying he had made contact with the plaintiff on the telephone despite the “overwhelming evidence” that he had made contact with the plaintiff and conveyed to the meeting the reason why the plaintiff had not attended it. 
      
      
     Mrs Singh had a good recall of the events, in the right sequence, and the inability to recall one matter, which did not relate to the conversation the subject of these proceedings, even if this was the case, would not be significant. I do not regard the evidence of Mr Sanjay Singh having made this call and received this reply as “overwhelming”. The plaintiff’s evidence was that he did not come to the P&C meeting because it was the last day of school and he was busy with the students. Mr Singh’s evidence (set out below), which consisted largely of denials, was inconsistent with the evidence of the plaintiff and other witnesses, and also with the minutes, the accuracy of which he disputed. 
      
      
     (d) According to the diagram drawn by Mrs Singh, she was seated at the furthest point from the defendant during the meeting, the inference being that she may not have heard what was said.  
      
      
     It is significant that apart from the minor matters set out above, the defendant is unable to point to any actual errors in Mrs Singh’s evidence, and is obliged to fall back on the inference that she may not have heard what occurred. As I had occasion to observe when he was in the witness box, the defendant has a very loud voice, and the likelihood of Mrs Singh not hearing what he had to say, in a comparatively small room with no other distracting noise, is implausible. While other persons in the room were talking (T 222) there was no evidence that anybody was talking over the defendant, who was running the meeting and very much in charge. 
      
      
     Mrs Singh’s evidence that a “further complaint” should be made does not refer to the police, but her recollection of a “further complaint” is some corroboration (albeit slight) for the plaintiff’s reference to the referral of the matter to the police. The best corroborative evidence for this is, however, the two letters of the P&C dated 8 and 10 February 2009 (Exhibits F and H) which state this categorically. 
    [113] Mrs Singh was the only person called by the plaintiff from the meeting, but the defendant called a number of committee members. I shall deal with the evidence of each of these witnesses separately.Mr Gailash Maharaj[114] Mr Gailash Maharaj gave evidence that “we were basically talking about” the teacher profile forms and that the plaintiff was “asked about those forms when he came in” (T 367).[115] His evidence as to the precise conversation was: 
     
     “A. The president asked him, ""Did you fill the forms?"" and in reply Mr Shandil said yes he did, and then the second part was about the signatures. He said like, ""Did you do the signatures?"" and Mr Shandil replied, ""Yes I did because the reason,"" and the president asked him, ""What was the reason for that?"" - ""Because it was running late for the grant?"" - and in reply Mr Shandil said like, ""What are you guys going to do about it?"" and this worker [sic] is worried. 
      
      
     Q. I'm sorry, what was that last bit? 
      
     A. And when he was asked like - when the president asked him why did he put the signatures without the teachers' consent, and he said because he was running late for the - to lodge forms, and ""What are you guys going to do about it? If I have done it, what are you guys going to do about it?""” (T 368) 
    [116] Mr Maharaj was very definite that the defendant had not accused the plaintiff of forgery, saying “He didn’t say that” (T 371). He was shown the minutes, and said they were an accurate record, but when taken to the portion of the minutes where the word “forgery” appears, and asked if he still said the minutes were accurate, he said “see, this is where I get a bit confused here” (T 371). He then changed his evidence: 
     
     “Q. Yes. Do you remember it saying, on paragraph 2, that ""the teacher profile form for Shaireen Lata, which the president found out that the principal forged her signature""? 
      
     A. Yeah, this - when everything started, we had a few minutes, and then this was raised, this how - and then we have to call Mr Shandil about it. 
      
      
     Q. This was raised by Mr Sharma? 
      
     A. Because-- 
      
      
     Q. Sorry, yes or no. Was it raised by Mr Sharma? 
      
     A. Do they write [sic] the proceedings? Sharma, yeah, because he worked out - documents in his handwriting about these teachers' profile form. 
      
      
     Q. And he told you, did he, that the form had been forged? 
      
     A. He didn't tell me. First, he passed the forms to all the committee members, we all had a look, all the members, at the writing and the signature. So we all put our views, we all said that it looks like exactly the same person has filled the form that has done the writing. 
      
      
     Q. Sir, he told you that the form had been forged, didn't he? 
      
     A. He didn't use that terminology, but he said that, for this, we have to ask Mr Shandil about it. Before Mr Shandil came, there was no forged form that was used. After Mr Shandil came - whereas he approved it. 
      
      
     Q. Sir, he said to the committee that, ""Mr Shandil has committed forgery,"" didn't he? 
      
     [Objection] 
      
      
     A. This is like during the meeting? 
      
      
     Q. Yes, during the meeting or before the meeting. Sorry, I withdraw that. During the meeting - that is, when the executive committee members are together. 
      
     A. All together, yeah. Once we were - once all the committee members - we had a look at the form, then we decided, like, this bit here has been forged. That was the reason that Mr Shandil was called by phone, to explain about this. 
      
      
     Q. Sir, have a look, please, at exhibit 6, and I've marked the spot with the tag. You see the first sentence: ""The president found out that the principal forged her signature."" Do you see that? 
      
     A. On which clause-- 
      
      
     [The witness is shown the document] 
      
      
     Q. Well then, doesn't that show that the president found out that the principal had forged Shaireen Lata's signature? 
      
     A. This document? I'd say yes. 
      
      
     Q. And is this a record of what occurred, in the order in which it occurred, in the meeting? 
      
     A. Can you explain, please, a bit more. 
      
      
     Q. Yes. When you say it's an accurate record, do you understand it to be an accurate record-- 
      
     A. All the minutes of the meeting. 
      
      
     Q. --of what occurred, in the order in which it occurred? 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Do you see, then, at paragraph number 6 on page 4-- 
      
     A. Yes. 
      
      
     Q. --Mr Sanjay Singh went to call the principal? 
      
     A. Yeah. 
      
      
     Q. The principal came to the meeting at 2.47. 
      
     A. Yes.  
      
      
     Q. Doesn't that suggest, sir, that a discussion that the president found out about the principal forging the signature occurred before Mr Shandil came to the meeting? 
      
     A. Yeah, but on this one - can I go to it again? 
      
      
     Q. Sorry, did you say yes? 
      
      
     HER HONOUR: No, he wants to go back again. 
      
      
     WITNESS: No, no, can you excuse me, sir. You're not giving me time, please. 
      
      
     RASMUSSEN 
      
      
     Q. That's all right. 
      
     A. Because, as about 30 November - the meeting - it was not straight when we started that meeting, regarding about Mr Shandil and the president, please. It was the night before - we had a presentation night, and it was a review of our presentation, how we went last night, and then it was getting ready for 2009. Then this teacher profile form the president put forward. Before Mr Shandil came to that meeting, the president has never used that word ""forgery"" because he said it's only - he showed us the form, passed it to us, and let Mr Shandil come and explain about this, which he did, and then from there - then we classified - all the members, we have basically agreed we want to hear from Mr Shandil, whether he did it or not. Because we can't say he has forged the signature before we hear from Mr Shandil. 
      
      
     So once Mr Shandil approached, he came, he was given a seat. He didn't take the seat, and he was in a hurry, and said, ""What is it all about?"" And we asked him - the president asked him about these two letters, the form, the signature. He agreed that it - yes, he did. The reason for that was he was running late for a grant. Otherwise, we were going to miss the grant out. Then the question was asked, why did he forge the signature. Go back to it again: because we were running late. So then the forgery thing came, because he thinks, there's a committee, a small organisation - because we are governed by law and, like, it is for us - it was a forgery. That's what it was all about. Then we requested, and Mr Shandil was told, that, ""Please, we don't need your service, and your contract is terminated for next year. We don't need the services of principal to the school.""” 
    [117] Insofar as it is possible to understand this confused and inconsistent answer, it would appear that Mr Maharajah has conceded that the allegation of forgery was raised, and raised before the plaintiff’s explanation was sought. [118] Concerning the explanation, Mr Maharajah was very certain the plaintiff had not provided the explanation that he had the teacher’s permission: 
     
     “Q. Sir, Mr Shandil told you and the committee that he had the permission of Mrs Lata to fill in the form and sign her name. 
      
     A. He never told us in the meeting. To my knowledge, I never hear that he said - he said that he has done the signature, ""and what are you guys going to do about it"". He shows his ego a little bit, ""and what are you going to do about it"". That was his attitude. 
      
      
     Q. Sir, he said that he had the permission of that teacher to sign the form on her behalf. 
      
     A. As far as to my knowledge, I didn't hear that. He just said he did the form because he was running late to post the form for the grant, and that's the reason he did it. 
      
      
     Q. Mr Sharma said that Mr Shandil had forged signatures of two teachers, didn't he? 
      
     A. The president, after Mr Shandil attended the meeting, he approved it, then he basically said, ""Right, according to this, he has done it. It is a forgery."" 
      
      
     Q. Mr Sharma certainly used the word ""forgery"" during this meeting, didn't he?  
      
     A. He used the ""forgery"" after Mr Shandil admitted it, that he did it. To my knowledge, I can't see why he can [sic] have used that terminology, because if a person admit that he has done a forgery, it means he has done it.  
      
      
     Q. Sir, you found out since that date that Mr Shandil in fact had the permission of Mrs Lata to sign that form, haven't you?  
      
     A. No, I haven't.  
      
      
     Q. No-one's told you that?  
      
     A. No.  
      
      
     Q. Mr Kumar hasn't spoken to you about it?  
      
      
     [Objection] 
      
      
     Q. Sir, has any person spoken to you about it at all?  
      
     A. Regarding what?  
      
      
     Q. That Mrs Lata had authorised Mr Shandil-- 
      
     A. No, as far as I know, no.  
      
      
     Q. Did Mr Narayan ring you on 30 November?  
      
     A. Mr Narayan? Who is Mr Narayan?  
      
      
     HER HONOUR 
      
      
     Q. Mr Uday Narayan, the honorary solicitor - did he ring you on the 30th?  
      
     A. On 30th in the afternoon they rang me.  
      
      
     RASMUSSEN 
      
      
     Q. Didn't he tell you? Didn't he ask--  
      
     A. He didn't tell me about - he didn't tell me anything about those signatures. The only thing he tell [sic] me was, ""What you guys are doing?"" That's what it's all about. Like, in other words, he is just the solicitor, or, what his term was using, like, to really scare us, like, ""What are you guys doing? The school is going to be closed, you're going to end up in legal hands,"" things like that, which we have never been through. It's just only a small organisation, and we never ever thought that we're going to end up anything like this.  
      
      
     Q. Sir, did Mr Sharma tell you that the funding had already been granted in respect of these teachers?  
      
     A. The form was lodged in first term, so it has to be approved.  
      
      
     Q. Sir, did you, as a committee member, believe that these forms were important for the funding, or something else?  
      
     A. Before that, we never used to see all these forms, because Mr Shandil used to handle all these matter by himself.” 
    [119] Mr Maharaja was unaware of any claim that the teachers authorised the plaintiff to sign despite a conversation with the school solicitor (and I note no challenge to the accuracy of this conversation was put to Mr Narayan by Mr Goldsmith) and the many subsequent activities of the parents who were concerned by what had happened. In addition, he did not consider it necessary to consult the teachers in question: 
     
     “Q. Sir, as a committee member, did it occur to you that you might ask Mrs Lata whether she had signed the form or not, or whether she'd given permission to sign the form?  
      
     A. Basically whenever we have a meeting, only at the school, it's basically handled by the president. He takes all those documents, and we leave it to the president. It's not all the members ringing anybody; we're not doing it. So actually, I did not. I did not ring anybody or ask anything about those signatures.  
      
      
     Q. What about Mrs Shikha Sharma?  
      
     A. No, I didn't.  
      
      
     Q. What about at the time that the meeting was held? Did anyone say, ""We should check with Mrs Sharma and Mrs Lata""?  
      
     A. I can't remember that.” (T 376 – 7) 
    [120] Although later in his evidence, Mr Maharaj changed his evidence to say that before the plaintiff came to the room the defendant “has never used the word ‘forgery’”, it is clear from his description of events that the version in the minutes and in his earlier testimony is correct, in that the allegation of forgery was raised before the plaintiff came to the meeting. Mr Maharaj sought to distance himself from both the investigations and the forgery findings, explaining, although not very clearly, that these matters were left up to the defendant: 
     
     “Q. Did anyone ask whether it mattered whether or not the information - that is, the details on the form - were correct or not?  
      
     A. According to the meeting, the thing was raised, but then we find it out about it, and the president said, ""Okay, look, but I'll do it.""” (T 377) 
    [121] Significantly, like the other witnesses for the defendant, he was completely unconcerned about the potential inaccuracy of any factual information in these allegedly forged documents; his sole concern was with the signatures (T 378).[122] Mr Maharaj said that the plaintiff was a very nice person to work with and that the “we always respected” him (T 380), but that in the last few meetings he had argued with them and during the 16 November meeting had walked out. This made him angry because when parents asked about the school presentation night “we can’t explain to any parents that Mr Shandil was not co-operating with us”. (T 380). He went on to say that “the only problem with Mr Shandil is this little bit of ego he has” (T 381) and that the sacking was justified because: 
     
     “But the draw line [sic] comes when the thing came - ""Now I use [sic] attempt forgery."" If a person can did [sic] that, and say, ""What are you guys going to do about it?"" What about tomorrow, he can jump in the bank account and do the forgery with the signatures? How can I accept or respect a person doing things like that? I don't. Personally, I don't sign my wife's signature and she doesn't sign my signature.” (T 381) 
    [123] Mr Maharaj’s hostility to the plaintiff was palpable, not only from statements such as these in the witness box, but from his comments during his evidence about caste (which he addressed to the plaintiff personally), and his complaint that the plaintiff said that the P&C members were uneducated, both of which were put in an aggressive tone. He changed his evidence concerning what was said at the meeting several times, and his claim of never knowing about the claim for authorisation, despite having a conversation with the school solicitor about it on the same day as the meeting, is implausible. I do not regard him as a witness of truth on any issue.Mrs Sneh Shankar[124] Mrs Shankar, a member of the P&C, appears to have been friendly with the plaintiff’s family. She was issued with a subpoena to give evidence for the plaintiff. She was, however, called by the defendant. She said she was upset with the plaintiff because he had sent her a subpoena, when it was the anniversary of her husband’s death and called him to say she was not going to come to court: 
     
     “A. The point of my calling Mr Shandil was that my husband's - anniversary prayers for his death were coming up. They were very much aware of that, and I was very hurt that I was subpoenaed to come to court them, knowing that what I was going through, and that really affected me, yes.” (T 392) 
    [125] Despite being upset at receiving a subpoena to give evidence from the plaintiff at such a difficult time, she came to court voluntarily to give evidence for the defendant. However, it transpired that her real concern was that there could be other defamation actions brought against members of the P&C, and that the plaintiff had said this to her (T 393).[126] Mrs Shankar’s version of what was said was the following: 
     
     “Q. Do you recall if there was any conversation between Mr Sharma and Mr Shandil following Mr Shandil's arrival? 
      
     A. Only that Mr Sharma said there were teacher forms, teacher-- 
      
      
     Q. I'm sorry, who said-- 
      
     A. Mr Sharma mentioned that there was forms there, and just needed verification as to who had filled out those forms. 
      
      
     Q. Was anything said in response to that? 
      
     A. Mr Shandil did say he had filled out the forms.” (T 394) 
    [127] She said that the plaintiff “wasn’t happy” about these questions, and that there was “a lot of conversation”, but she could not remember the details, although she thought that “Mr Shandil he sort of took Mr Sharma on, that even if he had filled out the form, if there was anything wrong, what could Sunil do about it, you know, to [sic] those contents.” (T 395). She did say, however, that the minutes were an accurate record of what occurred (T 397).[128] In cross-examination, when asked whether the plaintiff had said he had permission to sign, she said “I'm not sure whether that point was made in the meeting” (T 396). [129] Mrs Shankar’s hostility to the plaintiff became apparent when the bona fides of her explanation concerning the subpoena were challenged. It was put to her that the commemorative function for her husband had been for the week of 9 and 10 April, that she had invited the plaintiff and his wife to attend because she “had not foreseen any issues” (T 398) but then realised there could be unpleasantness if other persons involved in the litigation were present, and had told them they were no longer welcome to come to her home. There was another ceremony for her husband at 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday 19 April, but how this prevented her from answering a subpoena for this week-long trial was never made clear.[130] Mrs Shankar claimed she did not hear the plaintiff say he had authorisation because “maybe I wasn’t listening” (T 398), but she was listening closely enough to be certain that the word “forgery” had not been used. When shown the portion of the minutes referring to “forgery” and reminded that she had said the minutes were accurate, she said “Yeah, most of it”, claimed “I did not read line by line from the report” (T 399) and failed to answer a question about whether she had read this section (T 399). She went on to say that the order of events “may have been different” from the minutes (T 400) and that she did not recall the “precise sequence” of when the plaintiff was accused of forgery (T 400).[131] Mrs Shankar inconsistently claimed to be able to remember anything other than generalities but was very certain on some issues, such as whether or not “forgery” was used, but her evidence on this point was inconsistent. Her evidence that she may not have been listening to what the plaintiff said, and her inconsistent evidence about whether the minutes were accurate persuade me that she is not a witness upon whose credit any weight may be placed.Mr Kamlesh Chand[132] Mr Kamlesh Chand is the brother-in-law of the previous witness, Mrs Shankar (T 397) and, like her, a member of the P&C. His evidence was that the word “forge” was used, and that the plaintiff admitted to having forged the signatures, knowing that it was an offence, but saying he did not have any choice: 
     
     “A. Sunil asked him why - you know, why did he sign the forms, and he said, ""I think I've already said that,"" and then he asked him, ""So that means you have forged the signatures."" He admitted that. He said, ""Yes, I did forge the signatures, because I didn't have enough time to get it signed."" Then Mr Sunil said, ""Master"" - referring to Ashok, Mr Shandil - ""do you know it is an offence to sign or forge signatures on behalf of somebody without their permission?"" and he said, ""Yes."" He said, ""I didn't have any choice. I didn't have the time to get it signed by the teachers,"" and then Mr Sunil said, ""Mr Shandil, you know, this is misconduct, you know, we'll have to ask you to resign from the school."" Sorry, apologies.” (T 404) 
    [133] Mr Chand said that the plaintiff became very upset and aggressive, saying “Who are you to ask me to resign from the school?” and “the next thing I know he walked out of the meeting” (T 405) before the issue could be resolved. Following this, and in his absence, the committee had a discussion: 
     
     “A. Then we had - there was a discussion. There was a discussion about signing, and the members sort of agreed that, you know, it was an offence to sign on someone's behalf, and considering that Mr Shandil had admitted to signing that, that it was an offence. So, you know, there was a vote, and he was - you know, it was voted that, you know, he should resign, that his services should be terminated.” (T 404) 
    [134] This version of events, while it acknowledges the allegation of forgery, does not explain how the plaintiff came to have a letter accepting his resignation, nor is it consistent with the description in the minutes of the plaintiff being asked to return all the documents and leave the school premises by 4 pm that day. Mr Chand denied that any letter of termination was given (T 406).[135] Mr Chand was certain that the plaintiff had not said he had permission from the teachers to sign their names (T 405 – 6).[136] Mr Chand’s evidence indicates that an allegation of forgery was made, and that the plaintiff was dismissed for this reason. His claim that the resolution to sack the plaintiff came after the plaintiff gave his explanation is not one that I accept. I am satisfied, having regard to the minutes and to the sequence of events (including the handing of the letter of resignation to the plaintiff) that the P&C had decided to remove the plaintiff as Principal, and that he was called into the room to be told to resign (in which case he would be given the polite letter of resignation) or he would be dismissed on the spot.Mr Sanjay Singh[137] Mr Sanjay Singh was elected in March 2008 as the treasurer of the P&C. He told the court “I was a witness when Mr Sharma was asking the question with Shaireen [Mrs Lata]” (T 408). (A third member of the P&C was asserted to have been present, but this person, Mrs Shalendra Chand, did not give evidence).[138] Although he was present on 29 November, Mr Singh said that the first time he had ever seen the teacher profile form was when the defendant produced it and showed it to Mrs Lata during his conversation with her (T 409). He said he had no idea what was happening, and that he was collecting the tickets when the defendant came up to him and said “Can you be a witness?”[139] Mr Singh’s memory was poor. He could not remember whether the committee had made any decision about what to do about the plaintiff including whether to dismiss or sack him, because it was more than a year ago: 
     
     “A. I can't really recall on this one, so the committee would make a decision or not, I can't recall. It's already more than a year ago. But obviously there must be a minute to return which would have - what the committee has decided because we have minutes for that.” (T 411) 
    [140] Mr Singh’s evidence about what Mrs Lata said differed significantly from that of the defendant. Mr Singh was less concerned with the question of whether the form was authorised than with whether the information on the form was true and correct: 
     
     “Q. But as the committee member you knew, didn't you, that it was the responsibility of the principal, Mr Shandil, to fill in these forms? 
      
     A. That should be a part of - when a grant, it should be a principal's responsibility for the form to be filled, with the authorisation of the teacher, because that's the teacher should be knowing. And that's what we need to submit to the grant. 
      
      
     Q. So didn't it surprise you at the time that she was saying that she had no idea who filled it in and yet it might have been Mr Shandil who should have filled it in? 
      
     A. No. It was really surprising she had no idea, that's what - it really surprised me. As part of our grant procedure we need to have true and correct information to disclose the grant. 
      
      
     … 
      
      
     Q. Sir, when she said that she had no idea who filled it in, did you ask her whether the information in it was true and correct? 
      
     A. That's what I asked when she said, ""No."" That's why the next day we asked Mr Ashok Shandil, ""What's the reason? Who had done it?"" Because he's-- 
      
      
     HER HONOUR 
      
      
     Q. No, sir, you haven't understood. The thing is when she said she didn't know who signed it, didn't that make you immediately very suspicious about the accuracy of all of the information? 
      
     A. Yeah, because that's - I totally agree with that, but-- 
      
      
     Q. Well, didn't you go through all of the information with this lady. 
      
     A. Yeah. But she told me that's not her information, like, she didn't sign this form, she had no idea about it. That's the reason. 
      
      
     HER HONOUR 
      
      
     Q. No, look, I'm having a major problem here with this. I really need to understand it, because I need to understand why - if she said she had no idea who filled in - why didn't you go through every single line of it with her to make sure the information was correct? That's what I don't understand. I'm having great trouble with it. Can you help me? Why didn't this happen? 
      
     A. When she told the next - that's what we need to know the information. It was the last-- 
      
      
     Q. Hang on, this is the lady - this is her private information. Have I got this form wrong? This is all her private information, her address, her phone number. 
      
      
     A. Yes. 
      
      
     Q. Wouldn't you have gone through all of this? I just don't understand. 
      
     A. She had already gone through it. It's not her - it is not the correct information. She - the signature is not correct. So that's what we are thinking about. It's not our correct information. So if somebody have not acknowledged by the signatory this is her information, that's totally invalid information. That's why we need to know who did it. That's we are trying to get more detail into who have done all this profile form, and then next day we have asked Mr Sharma - sorry, Mr Shandil, who have asked - that's what we are trying to ask. Mr Shandil I was asking, because he is the one doing the grant for us.” (T 414 – 5) 
    [141] However, Mr Singh then changed his evidence, and admitted he had made no inquiry of Mrs Lata at all saying this was because he was merely there as a “witness”: 
     
     “Q. Mr Singh, didn't you take the profile form of Mrs Lata that was present and say to her, ""Well, you didn't sign it, but is the information in it correct""? 
      
     A. I was - I didn't ask this question, no. 
      
      
     Q. Mr Sharma didn't ask it either, did he? 
      
     A. It was Mr Sharma was asking each information about the signature and all this. Because I was a part of a witness only. I was witnessing what's happening between Mr Sharma and Mrs - sorry, Shaireen Lata. 
      
      
     Q. But Mr Sharma didn't ask Mrs Lata whether the information in the form was correct, did he, in your presence? 
      
     A. I can't recall. 
      
      
     Q. You can't recall. 
      
     A. Yeah. This one I can't - but I can't, this question if it was asked.  
      
      
     Q. I suggest to you, sir, that what you're telling the court is wrong. 
      
     A. No, but that's the information what you asking - with the signature, or whatever I'm recalling, that's what I'm telling you. As I said, I tell the truth whatever I know that I am telling you.” (T 415) 
    [142] Mr Singh was struggling to reconcile the implausibility of concern over another person’s signature where the information provided under cover of the signature was true and correct, and where no inquiry or concern had been expressed about that information being anything other than true or correct. Eventually he admitted he did not ask this question, and that he “can’t recall” if the defendant did.[143] Mr Singh had the same difficulty with his answers concerning whether or not the plaintiff had been accused of forgery at the meeting. He said that it was just not “the correct signature” and that it was “a teacher profile not correct”, although there was never any evidence that any information on the teacher profile was incorrect. Mr Singh simply denied everything, including that the defendant told the plaintiff he would be dismissed. He said the whole incident, which took 5 minutes, consisted of the plaintiff saying “I did it. What you guys can [sic] do?”: 
     
     “Q. Sorry, didn't Mr Sharma tell the committee, ""I have legal advice that Mr Shandil has committed forgeries?"" 
      
     A. No, he didn't say about anything regarding a forgery. 
      
      
     Q. Did he say, ""Mr Shandil should be dismissed and terminated from his position as principal of the school, and otherwise I will call the police""? 
      
     A. No. I totally disagree with that. 
      
      
     Q. Sir, the committee - Mr Sharma did tell the committee when Mr Shandil was present that he had committed a forgery, didn't he? 
      
     A. No, it was teacher profile was not correct. That's what we have discussed. 
      
      
     Q. Did he say to Mr Shandil in front of the committee that it was a forgery, and it was a serious offence? 
      
     A. No, it was told it was the two teacher profile was not correct and we need to liaise - we need to talk to Mr Ashok Shandil regarding this. That's what we did. That's why I was asked to go and call him during the meeting. 
      
      
     Q. Did Mr Sharma say to him, ""You know it's an offence to sign without their permission?"" 
      
     A. Sorry? 
      
      
     Q. Did you hear Mr Sharma say to Mr Shandil, ""You know it's an offence to sign without their permission""? 
      
     A. No. That was not - because Mr Shandil has come only for five - less than 5 minutes, and that - the only comment he made, ""I did it. What you guys can do?"" That was actually what he said.” (T 416) 
    [144] Mr Singh continued to insist that the problem was not that the plaintiff had signed these documents, but that he had signed them without the authorisation of the teachers (T 417). His evidence on this issue is at variance with that of the other witnesses, as well as with the minutes.[145] In cross-examination Mr Singh was shown the minutes which he had said in examination in chief were true and correct. He said that the references in the minutes to “forgery” were incorrect: 
     
     “Q. Is that correct? 
      
     A. Actually, what was said, the teacher profile - what I recall, it was our chairman said the profile was not - the signature was not correct. That's what we have discussed on that. That was our issue. 
      
      
     Q. And where it says-- 
      
     A. But we didn't have - we didn't say like - from my understanding we didn't say like it was a forge. We didn't say - unless we get a consent - we have asked the principal that's what we need to - was we are trying to ask, who have done - who filled the form and everything. That's what we were trying to ask. 
      
      
     Q. It wasn't a forgery, was it? 
      
     A. It was not - we didn't say it's a forgery, no. 
      
      
     Q. You didn't say that Shika Sharma's signature was a forgery? 
      
     A. No. 
      
      
     Q. So where it says the same thing in paragraph 2, that's incorrect, is it? 
      
     A. Yeah. Yes, because as it say it's ""forged"", but we didn't use the word ""forgery"".” (T 418) 
    [146] Mr Singh was the person who was sent by the P&C to bring the plaintiff into the meeting. He denied, however, that the description of what he did was correct: 
     
     “Q. So you didn't go to him and say, ""We want you to come to the executive committee to explain the forgery issue."" 
      
     A. No, but that's - ""We need you to come."" That's what - because he was a part of our member, and we want him to come. That's what I asked him to come. 
      
      
     Q. Did you say to Mr Shandil, ""Come to the meeting because we want you to explain the forgery issue""? 
      
     A. No, I asked him, ""Could you please come to the meeting."" That's what I've asked him. 
      
      
     Q. Can you look please at page 4 again in exhibit 6, paragraph 6 down the bottom. 
      
      
     RASMUSSEN: Just read out the first sentence to him so he knows. 
      
      
     RASMUSSEN 
      
      
     Q. Do you see where it says, ""Mr Sanjay Singh went to call the principal to explain to the P&C executive committee regarding the forgery issue."" 
      
     A. Mm-hmm. 
      
      
     Q. Do you say that that's incorrect. 
      
     A. I asked him to come in the meeting. That's what I asked him to come. 
      
      
     Q. So it's not correct then, is it, to say that you asked him to come ""regarding the forgery issue""? 
      
     A. No, but forgery was - we never used - we never talked about the forgery, so-- 
      
      
     Q. When did you see these minutes? 
      
     A. We see them the next meeting we have. 
      
      
     Q. Did you say to anyone in the committee, ""Hang on a second, these minutes are wrong""? 
      
     A. No, I didn't say anything. 
      
      
     Q. You didn't say, ""Hang on a second, I never said to him that I asked him to come in regarding the forgery issue."" You didn't say that to the committee, did you? 
      
     A. No.  
      
      
     Q. You didn't say to anyone in the committee, ""Hang on a second, what's in paragraph 2 is wrong as well. We never put to him anything about the forgery."" 
      
     A. No. 
      
      
     Q. You didn't say that to the committee on the next occasion. 
      
     A. No, I didn't say something like that.” (T 420) 
    [147] Mr Singh also denied that the plaintiff was given a termination letter.[148] Although Mr Singh’s evidence was that he was very concerned about the accuracy of the teacher profile forms, and about the department having been given wrong or misleading information, like the other witnesses, he had not made the slightest attempt either to verify the contents of the document, or to contact the department to correct any errors (T 422).[149] Mr Singh’s claim that the question was whether or not the document was filled out with the consent of the teachers is disingenuous. He made no attempt to speak to Mrs Sharma, and denied knowing about her teacher profile form, although he spoke about “forms” in the plural. It would have been obvious to him that if Mrs Lata’s personal details on the form were correct, there was a strong likelihood that she herself had provided them. His selective memory and inconsistent claims about what was said to Mrs Lata and whether the minutes are correct do not reflect well on his honesty. [150] Mr Singh made no secret of his disdain for the plaintiff, whom he painted as a lazy person just sitting around doing nothing, and not as a busy principal organising children on the last day of school.  
     
     “Q. Yes, but he was looking after the children, wasn't he? 
      
     A. No, he was not looking - he was like sitting on the stairs, that's it. It was not in the hall, it was outside the building, on the carpark. 
      
      
     Q. So are you saying that he's just sitting around at the school on the Sunday when he knew that there was an executive committee on and just couldn't be bothered to come along? Is that what you're saying? 
      
     A. Yeah. That's what [sic] he didn't come. That's right.” (T 418) 
    [151] Mr Singh was an unimpressive and at times untruthful witness, and his evidence is of no corroborative value on any issue.Other evidence about the 30 November meeting – the evidence of the school’s honorary solicitor[152] The minutes of meeting refer to the sacking of Mr Narayan as the school’s solicitor, as well as the sacking of the plaintiff. This occurred after a conversation he had with the defendant during or shortly after the P&C meeting. This conduct is significant, because not only have I found that the defendant represented to the P&C that he had obtained legal advice, but he and the P&C continued to make statements about legal advice and legal issues in the course of their dealings with the parents who complained about what occurred.Mr Narayan’s evidence[153] Mr Narayan is a solicitor who was admitted to practice in 2004. He was appointed the honorary solicitor for the school in 2006 (T 191). The plaintiff’s evidence was that after the events of the P&C meeting, he telephoned Mr Narayan and went to see him. The plaintiff’s wife gave evidence that she drove him there, and was present. Mr Narayan spoke to the teacher whose signature the plaintiff had been accused of forging, and then to the defendant.[154] Although Mr Narayan’s role in these events occurred at or shortly after the time the P&C meeting is noted as having ended, the minutes of that meeting have been extended to cover the discussion Mr Narayan had with the defendant.[155] Mr Narayan said that the plaintiff showed him the termination letter, but that he was too upset to talk about it, as the plaintiff was “almost in tears” (T 192). Mr Narayan’s evidence was that he took the following steps: 
     
     “A. He told me, firstly, that he received a letter, and the letter stated that he has committed forgery. He had signed two teachers' signatures on teacher profile, and as a result of legal advice given to the president of that association that he was dismissed on that ground, and I subsequently rang the president of the association, and two or three other executive members. I spoke to one of them, who made reference that I should speak to the president directly, because he was the one who made the decision in regards to the termination of the said principal of the school at that time. 
      
      
     Q. Did you speak to the president? 
      
     A. I left a message for the president to return my call, which he did after an hour and a half or so. During the course of our conversation I asked him that it is an appropriate thing for us to reconvene the executive meeting and discuss this issue in principle, and get the teachers in, so that we could sort it out and move on with the school. Mr President then, he advised me that he asked me, ""Question 1. Whose legal adviser are you? Are you the legal adviser for Mr Shandil or are you the legal adviser for me?"" My response to that question was, that I am neither his nor Mr Shandil's legal adviser. I am the legal adviser appropriately appointed at 2006 AGM. So, therefore, I am the legal adviser to the school. 
      
      
     Q. Okay. 
      
     A. And during the course of our conversation, the president asked me my personal home address, which I gave him, which was 69 Cockatiel Circuit, Green Valley in New South Wales 2168, and to my surprise I was given a termination letter which I received after four days, which said that my termination as a legal adviser to the school ends on 30 November, I understand. I understand there's a copy to that effect with you in your file. 
      
      
     Q. Can I show you a document. Do you recognise that? 
      
     A. Yes, I do. 
      
      
     Q. What is it? 
      
     A. This is the letter that I was - I received in my mail. The correspondence - the verbal correspondence on phone was with the president. But, however, I received this letter from Mr Shalendra Chand, the assistant secretary, terminating my services as legal adviser to the Hindi school.” (T 193) 
    [156] The fact that Mr Narayan said he saw the termination letter the plaintiff said was given to him at the meeting is corroborative of it having been given to the plaintiff at the meeting as he said was the case. [157] The advice Mr Narayan said he gave to the defendant which prompted this letter was as follows: 
     
     “A. I advised the president that the issue of committed forgery is not there, and the signatures that Mr Shandil was..(not transcribable)..to write, and in order to discuss that issue further and get the principal reinstated I requested the president that we should reconvene an executive meeting where I would be present to advise them the legalities of it, and then to work out the differences, if there was any, between anyone within the executive, and have the principal reinstated in this position for the betterment of the students and the community at large.” (T 194) 
    [158] The particulars of truth in the defence state that the defendant received legal advice that the plaintiff had committed forgery. Not only was Mr Narayan firm in his statement that he gave advice to the contrary, but he also confirmed that he was never consulted prior to this incident, even though he had been at the school function the night before: 
     
     “Q. Before Mr Shandil spoke to you on 30 November, had you heard anything at all from any person about any allegations of forgeries of any documents? 
      
     A. No. On the 29th of the same month, which is Saturday evening, the school had its annual presentation night, and I was available with the president and other executive members of the school, from 7.30 till midnight, and none of the executive members nor the president discussed any issues relating to this and no-one raised-- 
      
     A. No issues. 
      
      
     Q. No-one raised anything with you on the night before. 
      
     A. No.” (T 194) 
    [159] Nor was Mr Narayan given any opportunity to explain these legal principles to the school board at any later stage, despite being available and willing to do so: 
     
     “Q. Were you aware of a later meeting, a special meeting of any sort, that was convened at any other point in time? 
      
     A. Yes. I was informed by one of the parents and Mr Kumar I think his name who invited me to have a special AGM meeting which was conducted properly with the constitution and I was present in that. What happened was I was informed by the security guards that I was not a member of the association and therefore I should leave the premises of the school, which I did.” 
    [160] The instructions not to admit Mr Narayan to this meeting came from the defendant: 
     
     “Q. Had you sent notice of your intention to attend the meeting? 
      
     A. I was given all of the agendas and, as the legal adviser of the association, I felt it was my appropriate and professional duty to be present and to advise the AGM of the appropriate constitutional rights and the conduct of the meetings. 
      
      
     Q. One would assume that an instruction was given to a security guard not to allow you access. 
      
     A. Yes. The security guard told me the instructions came from the president, Mr Sunil Sharma, that I was not the financial member and therefore I should not be on the premises, and I should be removed straightaway. I volunteered to walk out of the school premises. I left the premises within 10 minutes or so.” (T 202) 
    [161] However, as Mr Narayan pointed out (T 202), it was not necessary for him to be a financial member of the school; he was attending in his capacity as the school solicitor, an appointment which had been made at the pervious annual general meeting, in circumstances where there had been no intervening meeting of the P&C or further annual general meeting to consider whether he should be sacked and, if so, whether another person should be appointed. (I note, from the evidence of the P&C members and the minutes, that it would appear he had been sacked by the defendant after the P&C meeting had ended). Mr Narayan’s evidence was that this was contrary to the school’s constitution.[162] Mr Narayan also explained that he was not giving advice to either the plaintiff or the defendant about these events; he was the school’s solicitor, and he was advising the school that these allegations of forgery were without foundation. He was not cross-examined about this, so at T 204 I asked: 
     
     “RASMUSSEN: Thank you, your Honour. That's the evidence. Could the witness be excused. 
      
      
     HER HONOUR: Just before he goes, am I right in thinking that nobody ever rang this gentleman for advice about what forgery was or anything like that? Everybody is agreed on that? That's right? 
      
      
     RASMUSSEN: Yes, your Honour. I understood that to be his evidence.” 
    [163] In cross-examination Mr Narayan confirmed that the school had, since 2003, been well-run and operated successfully, and that during the three years that he had been the school solicitor there had been no problems (T 199). Nothing was put to Mr Narayan about any complaint concerning his prior conduct, and nothing was put to him to the effect that his advice that no forgery had taken place was incorrect, biased or otherwise outside his role as the school solicitor. There could be no basis for the sacking of Mr Narayan as the school solicitor based on his prior conduct, or the correctness of this advice, of the appropriateness of the school solicitor giving it. Indeed, nothing was put to him to the effect that the defendant disputed Mr Narayan’s legal advice that the plaintiff had not committed forgery, which is significant as to the issue of knowledge of falsity in relation to any defence of qualified privilege.[164] Mr Narayan’s evidence of these events, and of the circumstances in which he later received a letter of termination, is relevant when considering the minutes of the P&C meeting, as it shows the reasons given in the minutes for his termination are dishonest. Mr Narayan gave sensible, objective, fair and legally correct advice to the defendant, and the defendant’s response was to ignore it, and ask for his home address, and then send a letter sacking him as school solicitor. This evidence demonstrates that the defendant not only knew that there had been no forgery, but that his sole motive was to have the plaintiff dismissed. He was willing to tell any lie (including lie to the P&C and tell them he had received legal advice), and to lie to this court in his pleadings by particularising in the defence that prior to 30 November 2008 he received legal advice that the plaintiff had committed forgery. Other parents of children at the school[165] The members of the P&C had in common the fact that they all had children studying at the school. The plaintiff called Mr Sunil Kumar, who had two children studying at the school. Mr Kumar’s wife was also one of the teachers at the school, and he heard about the plaintiff’s dismissal from her when she came home from teaching that day.Mr Sunil Kumar’s evidence[166] Mr Kumar is himself a teacher at a private college, and he took a great deal of interest in the activities of the Hindi school (T 225). He knew the plaintiff as the principal and the defendant as the president of the P&C Committee, but was not personally friendly with either.[167] Mr Kumar was concerned to hear from his wife about the plaintiff’s dismissal, so he telephoned first the defendant later that same evening, and then, to hear “both sides of the story”, telephoned the plaintiff: 
     
     “A. I called Mr Sharma, the P&C president, and I asked him what happened and he told me over the phone that him and his executive committee has dismissed the principal; and I did ask him on what grounds, as a concerned parent, and he told me that the principal had forged one of the teacher's signatures and it could have legal implications for the whole organisation, the Hindi language school. Then I called the principal, because I wanted to get both sides of the story. 
      
      
     Q. Let me stop you there for the moment. When you rang Mr Sharma, do you remember what time of day it was? 
      
     A. I think it was in the evening. 
      
      
     Q. After you spoke to Mr Sharma, I think you said you rang Mr Shandil. Is that right? 
      
     A. Mr Shandil. 
      
      
     Q. Could you tell me what you said to Mr Shandil and what he said to you? 
      
     A. I asked Mr Shandil about the allegation against him, about the forgery issue, and he said it was a teacher profile form that he had to fill in to pass - Department of Education, and that he print - he - it wasn't forgery, according to him. That's what he said to me. Then he explained that he didn't intend to gain anything personal from that, monetary or any material, and he wasn't trying to defraud any organisation, individuals. That's what he told me.” (T 226) 
    [168] Mr Kumar, having heard both sides of the story, then rang the defendant a second time to make a suggestion: 
     
     “Q. As a result of what Mr Shandil told you, did you do anything then? 
      
     A. Yes, I did. I called - I spoke to Mr Sharma again and I asked him if we can reconcile - reconsider the decision for the betterment of the institution and he refused to do so.” (T 226) 
    [169] Mr Kumar asked the defendant if he would hold a meeting so that parents could express their views. He again refused to do so. Mr Kumar, apparently on advice from the Department of Fair Trading, obtained the signatures of ten parents and sought an “open forum” for parents of children at the school to express their views. The defendant again refused (T 227). In the meantime, Mr Kumar had been sent by the plaintiff a copy of the explanatory letter one of the teachers had written, confirming that permission had been given by her to sign on her behalf. [170] By this stage Mr Kumar had spoken to a number of parents who also told him they were concerned: 
     
     “And then I spoke to other parents and the other parents came up as well, concerned parents, they came up. They were not happy with the situation and then we decided to organise a special general meeting ourselves and we circulated the agenda for the meeting, the notice for the meeting. On the day of the meeting, we went to the school—”(T 227) 
    [171] When the time came for the meeting, the parents were met, not by members of the P&C, but by hired bodyguards. Many people, including the plaintiff and Mr Narayan, were turned away and told to leave. Those who were able to get into the meeting, such as Mr Kumar, found that the meeting had been “hijacked” by the defendant (T 229) by the defendant, who chaired the meeting with his own agenda and refused to listen to any of the concerned parents. The agenda prepared by the parents who had organised the meeting was “taken away” and “not considered” (T 229).[172] Mr Kumar said that he and some of the other parents tried to raise the matters of concern to them but that they were “shouted down”, and that the defendant said to him “Sit down and be quiet” (T 230). The defendant then passed a document around at the meeting, and Mr Kumar and about a dozen of the parents went outside to look at them, as there was a lot of shouting going on (T 229-230). When they tried to get back into the meeting, the security guards would not let them enter (T 232).[173] At some stage a notice was put on the notice board in the hallway saying “Special meeting 15 February 2009 called by Sunil Kumar not the president is null and void."" (T 233, Exhibit Q). The contents of the rest of this document give an idea of the degree of bitter hostility towards not only the plaintiff but anyone who supports him. The rough handwritten notice (clearly added to at various different times during February) says as follows: 
     
      “8.2.09 
      
     ·  
     SECURITY 
     : hired by Exec Committee for Safety of children and parents on the premises. 
      
     ·  
     Special meeting 
      (15.2.09) called by  
     Sunil Kumar  
     [not the President] 
       
     is  
     null and void 
     . However, all members are requested to be present at school to voice your concerns. 
      
     ·  
     18 February 2009: Industrial Tribunal case: Ashok Shandil vs P&C. 
      
     ·

      Special meeting in School Hall at 1.20 p.m. Be present to voice your concerns.  
      
     ·  
     Suggestion Box: 
       
     express your opinions 
     .” 
    [174] The petition signed by a number of the parents concerning the meeting arranged by Mr Kumar was tendered. I inquired as to the number of children at the school, and put an estimate to the parties that about a third of the parents had signed the petition. The petition has notations about whether or not the persons who signed were financial members; it would appear that almost all of them were. No evidence was given by any of the defendants concerning the “special meeting” arranged by the P&C for 22 February, or the contents of the suggestion box, or what had led to the appointment of security guards for the safety of children and parents using government school premises on a Sunday when they would have been the sole persons present.[175] On 10 February a letter was sent to Mr and Mrs Kumar (Exhibit H). The text of this letter is set out in the section of this judgment concerning republication.[176] Mr Kumar said very frankly that he was concerned about the allegation of forgery, that he wanted to get to the truth of the matter, and that the purpose of the open forum was not the reinstatement of the plaintiff, but to find out the truth (T 236). Mr Kumar was in favour of giving the plaintiff a chance to explain his conduct in an open forum, and that was his sole motivation (T 236). The following was put to him in cross-examination: 
     
     “Q. But on a personal basis, you were opposed to reinstatement? 
      
     A. I didn't have a personal stake in any of the whole affair. 
      
      
     … 
      
      
     Q. What did you expect would happen after that? 
      
     A. I expected Mr Shandil would be given the opportunity to defend himself and also the parents will have the opportunity to see both sides of the whole affair, the story. 
      
      
     Q. And that was it? 
      
     A. That was it.” (T 236) 
    [177] Mr Kumar went on to explain why he felt this was necessary: 
     
     “Q. And then at the end of the agenda, you say, ""And to deal with the matter as appropriate."" What did you have in mind? 
      
     A. I actually had in mind, when the whole thing happened, when he got dismissed, I felt that things were not done in a fair way, a proper way. So I had in mind to have a forum where things could be done in a proper way, like have both sides of the story, the allegations, and Mr Shandil will be given the opportunity to defend himself and then the parents to decide. 
      
      
     Q. But you would not expect they would decide by way of a vote? 
      
     A. I couldn't foresee something like that.  
      
      
     Q. How could you foresee the matter being resolved? 
      
     A. I would have left it to the parents to decide.” (T 237) 
    [178] It was put to Mr Kumar that the letter of 10 February explained why the defendant ant the P&C had rejected all these proposals. Mr Kumar responded: 
     
     “Q. In that letter, an explanation was provided to you as to why the meeting you were seeking to hold on 15 February was not a valid meeting. You can see that? It's in the fifth paragraph. 
      
     A. Fifth paragraph. Your Honour, we did look into the model rules and we realised that we still could go ahead and have the meeting according to the Fair Trading Act.  
      
      
     Q. But this is a letter from the secretary of the committee advancing a reason as to why your meeting was not valid. 
      
     A. Yeah, then we did realise that we could still have the special general meeting because-- 
      
      
     HER HONOUR: I think he's saying that he doesn't agree, that he didn't accept it. 
      
      
     Q. Is that what you're saying? 
      
     A. Been accepted. That's what I'm saying, your Honour. 
      
      
     Q. Yes. You need to answer the question. Listen to the question and try and answer the question. 
      
     A. We didn't accept.  
      
      
     GOLDSMITH 
      
      
     Q. But you accept, do you not, that an explanation was given to you? 
      
     A. Yes, I accept that. 
      
      
     Q. Even though you didn't agree with it? 
      
     A. I didn't. 
      
      
     Q. To your knowledge, the decision not to deal with your agenda on 15 February, that's never been challenged, has it? Nobody has ever complained or come to court or a tribunal about that? 
      
     A. No, sir.” 
    [179] After being shut out of the first parents’ meeting, Mr Kumar did try to hold a second meeting, first on school premises, then at his home, but his notice to parents on the school notice board was torn down by the defendant: 
     
     “Q. Why was that? 
      
     A. That was done because we weren't allowed the opportunity to have our meeting so we had to change the time and the venue. 
      
      
     Q. What, if anything, did you do then with that document? 
      
     A. We circulated the document as much as possible to all the parents. I put up a notice - can I add on a few things? 
      
      
     Q. Of course, yes. 
      
     A. I put up a notice on the walls outside to inform the parents about the changes to the venue and the time. At the end of the meeting, the P&C's meeting that they had, when they finished the meeting, the chairman, the president, came out of the hall, he took the notice off the wall and I said to Mr Sharma, I said, ""Can I please have my notice back?"" He tore it into pieces and then he gave it to me. 
      
      
     Q. Is there a reason why you changed it to 41 Chilton Avenue, Oakhurst? 
      
     A. Yes. At that point, in that short time, we couldn't get a venue. That was the only venue we had - the only option we had was that address.” (T 240 – 1) 
    [180] The evidence of Mr Kumar that he was told by his wife (a teacher at the school) that same day that the plaintiff had been dismissed for forgery after words spoken by the defendant to the plaintiff to this effect is further corroboration of the likelihood of these words having been spoken by the defendant. In addition, Mr Kumar telephoned the defendant straight away and had a discussion about this, in which the defendant used the word “forgery”. Mr Kumar’s evidence about the circumstances in which, following his conversation with the defendant, he and his wife received Exhibit H (which is relied upon by the plaintiff for damages as a republication) is another link in the chain of evidence relevant to determine what was said at the meeting, and it is to this issue that I now turn.Was the matter complained of published?[181] The defendant’s submissions on publication consist essentially of stating that as well as the defendant’s denial of the slander, Mr Maharaj, Mrs Shankar, Mr Chand and Mr Singh “did not give evidence of the slander” (written submissions, p. 9) and that the minutes “do not support the allegation that the slander occurred”. Mrs Singh’s evidence is dismissed on the basis that she was not present for the entire meeting, her memory was not good, that she did not give evidence of the slander in its entirety and that she only said the word “forgery” might have been used.[182] The members of the P&C were effectively participating in the activity of sacking the plaintiff on the spot. It is not a question of how many witnesses say what was said; it is a question of objective analysis of all of the circumstances, including the objective likelihood of what the defendant and other P&C members said, when sacking the plaintiff in this very peremptory fashion and recording it in the minutes, and what the plaintiff replied, having regard to the evidence of other persons he spoke to on the day to whom he repeated what the committee said. In addition, subsequent documents prepared by the defendant on behalf of the P&C, purporting to justify what was done, make statements giving a clear picture not only of what they thought the plaintiff had done wrong but the way in which that asserted wrongdoing was communicated to him.[183] It is not necessary for the plaintiff to produce a witness who will testify, word for word, as to the text of the slander. It is still possible for there to be publication even where no witness comes forward to testify that the words were spoken, as long as there were persons in a position to hear the words complained of. In Duckworth v First National Bank 254 SC 563, 176 SE 2d 568 the only witness to a slander denied hearing the words spoken. As the evidence was that there was a crowd present and the defendant shouted the words, the court permitted the matter to go to the jury, which found for the plaintiff.[184] I shall first set out the principles relevant for the establishment of whether a slander has been published.Relevant legal principles concerning whether a slander has been published [185] The principles relevant to whether a slander has been published may be summarised as follows: 
     
     (a) It is sufficient for the plaintiff to prove the substance of the words pleaded as long as the sting of the libel is there:  
     Lamb v West  
     (1884) 15 LR (NSW) 120;  
     Sutherland v Neill  
     (1887) 6 NZLR 5 at 10 per Williams J;  
     Sinclair v Bjelke-Petersen 
      [1984] 1 Qd R 484;  
     Buchanan v Jennings  
     [2005] 1 AC 115. In the case of use of the word “forgery”, this is a word with a very precise meaning of serious criminal conduct, and the finding that such a word has been used would go a long way to establishing that the sting of what was said is what has been pleaded by the plaintiff as well as particularised in imputations of forgery and criminality. Importantly, in  
     Tournier v National Provincial and Union Bank of England 
      [1924] 1 KB 461 at 470 Bankes LJ noted that each case turns on its facts, and there is no specific rule as to what is a substantial difference. Lord Atkin added: “No slander of any complexity could ever be proved if the  
     ipsissima verba  
     of the pleading had to be established (at 478). The law does not demand a level of precision which is unattainable in practice, as  
     Gatley on Libel & Slander  
     (10th ed., 34.16) points out. 
      
      
     (b) Contemporaneous documentation is often of considerable importance in such cases, having regard to what McLelland CJ in Eq in  
     Watson v Foxman  
     (1995) 49 NSWLR 315 at 318 - 319 called the fallibility of memory. In the present case, the minutes of meeting, the letter to the NSW Police Service, the letter to Mr and Mrs Kumar of 10 February 2009, the statement by Mrs Lata of 1 December and the general pattern of documentation following these events is of significant assistance. 
      
      
     (c) While “attention to detail” ( 
     Ingot Capital Investment Pty Ltd v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets (No. 6)  
     (2007) 63 ACSR 1 at [353]-[355] per McDougall J) is required where the nuances of what is said will be important in many cases, some words, such as “forgery”, or “pregnant”, have no shades of meaning. This is one of those cases. There can be no doubt that a very serious allegation of criminal conduct warranting instant dismissal was put to the plaintiff, and that he was dismissed for being guilty of this conduct.  
      
      
     (d) The same principles of common sense used in the interpretation of documents and agreements between contracting parties should apply when considering what actually happened when one party takes a step that has legal consequences for the other, such as sacking or dismissing them:  
     Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd 
      (1973) 129 CLR 99 at 109-110 per Gibbs CJ;  
     Peppers Hotel Management Pty Ltd v Hotel Capital Partners Ltd 
      (2004) 12 BPR 22,879; [2004] NSWCA 114 at [69] per McColl JA. While a newspaper may fear to strike openly at a target, a person who is sacking someone for misconduct is arguably more likely to identify the wrongdoing for which the person should be sacked, especially if the consent of other persons is sought as to such a step. 
    [186] I now summarise my findings in relation to the evidence.Evidence concerning publication[187] The inherent improbability of the defendant’s version of what was said is clear from the following objective evidence: 
     
     (a) The defendant does not actually have any alternative version of what was said. It is not in dispute that the plaintiff was confronted with allegations of a very precise (and criminal) nature, and sacked for these offences. The defendant’s position that none of the matter complained of was published is untenable even on his own version of the facts. 
      
      
     (b) It is clear that the information about this alleged wrongdoing did not come from anyone other than the defendant, and that the defendant was careful to keep this information to himself until the meeting. Even his “witness” (Mr Sanjay Singh) had no prior knowledge of what he was witnessing when the meeting between the defendant and Mrs Lata occurred. Mrs Sharma and Mrs Lata gave evidence which I unreservedly accept not only as being truthful, but as being information they not only would have but did provide to the defendant and anyone else who had inquired, and the defendant was careful to keep that evidence from the meeting. That evidence was that they authorised the plaintiff to fill in the teacher profile form on their behalf and to sign it on their behalf. The defendant also kept from the meeting the knowledge that there was no question as to the accuracy of the information in this document, a significant matter given the emphasis laid upon its accuracy by the defendant in his evidence (T 428). 
      
      
     (c) It is inherently improbable that Mrs Lata would tell the defendant on 29 November that she had no idea who filled in the form, since that was the same person who signed it, and it is inherently improbable that she would tell him she did not authorise this when she made a written statement to the contrary on 1 December 2008. The defendant lied to the P&C, and in his evidence, in saying to the contrary, and I do not accept the evidence of the “witness” as corroboration. 
      
      
     (d) It is inherently improbable that no attempt was made by the defendant to contact either teacher prior to 29 November, and also the plaintiff, especially since the defendant passed up opportunities to raise the matter when giving concert tickets to Mrs Lata, and both she and Ms Sharma were teaching at the school and could have been called upon for an explanation, and he could have contacted the plaintiff at any time by email or telephone if there was a real concern. 
      
      
     (e) It is inherently improbable that no attempt was made by the defendant or any other concerned P&C member to put this important issue onto the agenda for the meeting, or to require the plaintiff to provide an explanation, or to seek legal advice about what to do, especially since the school had an honorary solicitor for this purpose. Similarly, there is no evidence that the defendant made any inquiry of the Department other than for information about the P&C’s power to sack the plaintiff. 
      
      
     (f) It is clear from the evidence of the P&C Committee that nothing was said about these allegations until some time after the meeting started. Mrs Singh, who was always late, was still in time for this issue, which appears to have arisen about half an hour into the meeting “out of the blue”. The P&C members who gave evidence did not say that they had any knowledge of a move to sack the plaintiff prior to the meeting. However, the plans for a temporary new Principal were so far advanced that according to the minutes, the new Principal was called in and appointed at 3.05 p.m., a matter of minutes after the conversation between the plaintiff and defendant (after the plaintiff’s arrival at 2.47pm) resulting in the plaintiff’s dismissal occurred. 
      
      
     (g) It is inherently improbable that the plaintiff was sacked without the word “forgery” being used, or that the plaintiff admitted committing forgery without the defendant raising the issue, discussing or commenting on it. 
      
      
     (h) As to the portion of the matter complained of that the defendant had received legal advice that the plaintiff committed forgery, the defendant particularised this as a particular of truth, although he withdrew this claim during the hearing, and the claim of receiving legal advice was a theme in the publications which are relied upon for damages for republication, one of which is in fact a solicitor’s letter. Although only the plaintiff said that this was said, I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that this statement was made. 
      
      
     (i) As to whether the defendant threatened to call the police, I am satisfied that a threat of this kind was made, and made to the plaintiff, for the purpose of intimidating him into resigning. Although Mrs Singh’s evidence does not go this far, Exhibits F and H corroborate the plaintiff’s claim that it was raised at the meeting. 
      
      
     (j) As to the form of the publication as one continuous statement, I do not accept the defendant’s claim that this is implausible. The defendant was not holding an inquiry; he was handing down a decision for the plaintiff to accept. I am satisfied that the defendant had already decided to dismiss the plaintiff, and was calling him in only to tell him to go quietly (in which case they would give him the 30 November letter) or be sacked, and risk the repetition of these terrible allegations, as the minutes note. The defendant arranged this so that the P&C did not have a lot of time to devote to any inquiry or discussion with the plaintiff, because they had not been given any documents or prior notice, and the school had to be shut by 4 p.m. The new temporary Principal was in place by 3.05 p.m.  
    [188] I also take into account matters not put to the plaintiff in cross-examination: 
     
     (a) the plaintiff’s account of approaching the meeting and hearing the defendant addressing the meeting in terms of the matter complained of was never challenged by the defendant; 
      
      
     (b) the plaintiff’s account of not having given this document to the defendant was not challenged; 
      
      
     (c) I find the plaintiff did tell the defendant that he signed with authority, and that he did so in May, and that the defendant was so unconcerned about this that he did nothing until November when, following the 16 November meeting argument, he decided to have the plaintiff sacked, and began casting about for an excuse. 
    [189] I find that the defendant did say that the plaintiff had committed forgery, that he had forged signatures of two teachers on teacher profile forms, and that he had had legal advice to this effect, that the plaintiff should be dismissed from his position as principal of the school, and that if this did not occur the defendant was going to call the police.[190] This brings me to the issue of the imputations conveyed.Are the imputations conveyed?Imputation (a) – The plaintiff committed forgery; Imputation (b) – The plaintiff forged the signatures of teachers on profile forms.[191] The defendant refers me to Holmes v Fraser [2008] NSWSC 570 at [24]-[27], where Simpson J sets out the principles relating to the ordinary reasonable reader or listener.[192] Firstly, the defendant submits (concerning all the imputations) that imputations of guilt differ from imputations of suspicion, and certain of the imputations (the defendant does not say which) convey an imputation of suspicion rather than guilt, citing Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1964] AC 234; Jackson v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd [1981] 1 NSWLR 36; Mirror Newspapers Ltd v Harrison (1982) 149 CLR 293 and Rakhimov v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2001] NSWSC 10. I am satisfied, however, that the language of the publication is the clear language of guilt.[193] The defendant’s submission that the accusation or conclusion that forgery actually amounts to a crime is not made in the slander, and that without this it cannot be more than suspicion, is mischievous, and unsupported by authority. The use of the word “committed”, the reference to legal advice and calling the police, and the precise identification of the forgery involved, all make this a very clear example of imputations of guilt being conveyed.[194] Secondly, a challenge was brought to the use of the word “forgery” as ambiguous and as having a legal meaning distinct from its ordinary meaning (Singleton v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR 425).[195] The defendant relies upon Mitchell v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 1051 at [29], where her Honour was of the view that the word “assaulted” had an ordinary meaning namely that of a “physical attack” in addition to its technical legal meaning, where an actual assault was not required. Much was the case was the same in relation to “breach of trust” in Singleton v Ffrench, supra.[196] However, this does not mean that any word which is also capable of a special legal meaning is by definition ambiguous. An imputation that a plaintiff is a paedophile (Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 510) is not one that is capable of being ambiguous, and an allegation of forgery is the same. In Brady v Norman [2010] EWHC 1215 (QB) at [11], Eady J simply noted that there could be little doubt that an allegation of forgery would constitution slander per se.[197] As to how to deal with criminal offences where there are specific elements, I note the approach taken by Newnes J in Forrest v Askew [2007] WASC 161 at [62] and [63].[198] The case to which Newnes J referred, Hill v Westfield [2003] NSWSC 437, was one where Simpson J was concerned that the ordinary reasonable reader might not know that insider trading was a criminal offence. The same could not be said of forgery, for the reasons explained by Eady J.[199] I am satisfied that each of imputations (a) and (b) are conveyed.Imputation (c) – The plaintiff is a criminal.[200] The defendant submits that this imputation is not conveyed because all that is conveyed is a suspicion, and the defendant did not say forgery was a crime.[201] I am satisfied the matter conveys an imputation of guilt for both teacher profile forms, not suspicion. While I am conscious of the decision of Simpson J in Hill v Westfield [2003] NSWSC 437 concerning insider trading, “forgery” is a term well within the grasp of the ordinary reasonable listener, particularly when the person making the allegation goes on to say exactly what was forged, namely the signatures of two teachers on teacher profile forms. [202] A third basis for objection is that the imputations of fact (forging signatures) and a general condition (being a criminal) are not capable of being conveyed, and that more than one act would be required before a person could be called a criminal. [203] When considering imputations about whether conduct of a criminal nature is conveyed, it is helpful to look to see if more than one act of criminal conduct is referred to. There is a description of the plaintiff as having forged more than one signature on more than one document in circumstances where there is legal advice that the plaintiff has committed “forgeries”. In addition to the acts, the plaintiff is entitled to plead an imputation of condition, and this imputation is not subject to any defect in form, nor is it incapable of being conveyed. [204] I accordingly find that this imputation is conveyed.[205] One additional matter that I should deal with is the claim that the fact that the sentence “does not appear to make sense” prevents it from conveying an imputation. [206] In Sinclair v Bjelke-Petersen [1984] 1 Qd R 484, Kelly J considered the approach the court should take when the matter complained of is difficult to understand: 
     
     “It was necessary for the respondent to establish that the substance of the words complained of in the statement of claim were used by the appellant. That rule was expressed in  
     Lamb v West 
      (1894) 15 NSWLR 120 by Darley CJ at p 126 in these words:  
      
      
       
      “… it has been held that if the words proved and the words laid in the declaration convey the same meaning to the mind of a reasonable man, that is sufficient, and that, to my mind, is the only safe rule.”” 
      
    [207] The fact that the words spoken may cause some difficulties in interpretation does not mean that no imputation should be seen as being capable of being conveyed. However, I have no difficulty in understanding the words, and I do not understand why it is the defendant claims that this sentence makes no sense. Effectively the plaintiff is being told unless he is dismissed and terminated from his position, the police will be called in to investigate (conduct which arguably may breach s 99 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)). [208] As the extracts from this transcript show, the defendant and most of the defendant’s witnesses were not well-educated persons and they made many grammar mistakes. What they said was not always grammatically correct, but the meaning was generally not too difficult to determine. This is one of those occasions. Imputation (d) – The plaintiff should be dismissed from his position of principal of the Australian Institute of Hindi Language Studies.[209] The defendant in written submissions does not challenge that this imputation is capable of being conveyed.Imputation (e) – The plaintiff’s conduct should be referred to the police.[210] The use of the word “should” encapsulate the sting of the matter complained of very well. What is being said is that the plaintiff deserves to be investigated by the police.[211] I am satisfied that imputation (e) is conveyed.Are the imputations defamatory?[212] The test is whether ordinary right-thinking members of the community would think less of the plaintiff: Amalgamated Television Services v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158. Imputations (a)-(c) and (e) are serious allegations of criminal conduct, as the defendant concedes by noting that the standard of proof must be to the Briginshaw standard (Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336). They are clearly capable of being defamatory of the plaintiff. Imputation (d), relating to conduct warranting dismissal, is also clearly capable of being defamatory.Republication[213] The plaintiff brings a claim for republication in relation to the documents which are exhibits F, G and H, the text of each of which is set out above. This is an issue going to damages only, but which is more conveniently dealt with, in terms of liability for republication, in the section of the judgment concerning publication, as entitlement to damages will only arise if the claim for republication can be made out. One of the issues will be whether the sense and substance of each of these publications contains what the defendant calls “a repeat of the sense and substance of the matter complained of” and comparison of the text with the matter complained of is therefore required.The form of the republication plea[214] The plea of republication as set out in the statement of claim is as follows: 
     
     “ 
     Particulars of Re-Publication 
      
      
     The Defendant caused the defamatory words or words of the same substance or effect or similar defamatory words to be published by the secretary of the Australian institute of Hindi Language Studies (Virendra Prasad) in letters written to Mr Sunil Kumar and Mrs Urmila Kumar on 10 February 2009. The Defendant further caused Mr Sohan Singh of Sohan Singh & Associates (Barristers & Solicitors) to republish the said words or words similar or of the same substance and effect as the said words in a letter to the officer in charge of the Mt Druitt Police Station of 17 January 2009 which stated, among other things, that the Plaintiff had forged two signatures and passed off documents as originals and called for a police investigation into the Plaintiff.” 
    [215] I should first note a concession made by the defendant during the submissions. In the defendant’s written submissions, a claim was originally made that the plaintiff has inadequately pleaded republication in that it is not pleaded but merely particularised, and the plaintiff has never made the required election as to whether he alleged a separate cause of action or additional damages. [216] In oral submissions, Ms Chrysanthou for the defendant expressly resiled from any claim that the republication had not been properly pleaded and said no point would be taken as to the asserted inadequacy of any pleading of the republication. The only point that would be taken would be that the requirements to establish republication (Speight v Gosnay (1891) 60 LJQB 231) were not made out.[217] This was a very proper concession for Ms Chrysanthou to have made, because the purpose of the Defamation List is to determine disputed issues of pleadings before the trial, rather than to have a party fail to take a pleading point and then raise it at the trial. The purposes of s 56 Civil Procedure Act 2005 are undermined if parties conduct litigation in such a manner. The “fresh step” rule, which requires a party faced with a deficient pleading to take that point swiftly or lose the opportunity to object, is not often invoked, but prior to the Civil Procedure Act was a useful tool to ensure that parties fought cases on their merits rather than on issues of refinement of pleading. The repeal of s 159 District Court Act and its replacement with s 63 Civil Procedure Act was considered by the NSW Court of Appeal in Deveigne v Askar (2007) 239 ALR 370, and I note the Court’s comments concerning the costs implications of failing to act promptly (at 3], [20]–[24], [186]–[190]). Noting Ms Chrysanthou’s concession, I have not dealt with the technical issues set out in the written submissions, as they were not the subject of any further oral or written submissions of either party, for this reason.[218] The first issue is whether the republication repeats the sense and substance of the matter complained or, and no submissions have been made to the contrary here.[219] The second issue is whether it was the natural and probable consequence that the republication would occur as the result of the original publication: Speight v Gosnay, supra, at 232; Ainsworth v Burden (2003) 56 NSWLR 630 at [5] per Handley JA. Whether or not, as a matter of causation, the defendant is liable for the particularised republication is a question of fact to be determined by the tribunal or fact: Habib v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 231 at [124].[220] I agree with the defendant’s submissions that the onus in this regard lies on the plaintiff.The evidence concerning republication[221] The minutes of meeting refer to the possibility of republication of the allegations as being a reason the plaintiff was urged to resign. The minutes say that Mr Narayan asked the plaintiff to step down from his position “to avoid dreadful repetition of school and community in general” (Exhibit 6, p. 4, paragraph 5). Clearly, the P&C were aware that these dreadful allegations would be repeated in the school and in the community. This did in fact occur, as the 39 signatures on the letter to the P&C from angry parents makes clear. [222] The circumstances in which an original publisher will be held liable for the repetition of defamatory matter where: 
     
     (a) the defendant has authorised the repetition, explicitly or impliedly; 
      
      
     (b) where he intends the matter to be republished; and/or, 
      
      
     (c) where the republication is the natural and probably consequence of the original defamation; and/or, 
      
      
     (d) where there is a duty cast on the recipient of the libel to republish it. 
    [223] Although in Speight v Gosnay (1891) 60 LJQB 231 Lopez LJ considered the responsibility of the original publisher for republication where the recipient had a duty to republish it was confined to a moral duty, Tobin & Sexton at [5,390] note the opinion that any social or legal duty by the republisher to repeat the defamation would be sufficient to establish liability of the original publisher.[224] I shall deal with each of the publications in turn.The letter of 17 January 2009 to Mount Druitt Police (Exhibit G)[225] The defendant submits that the letter from Mr Sohan Singh of 17 January 2009 stated that he is writing on behalf of the P&C (whose meeting of 30 November 2008 is where the matter complained of was published). He also was not present at the meeting of 30 November and it is submitted that as he did not actually hear the words spoken he is not republishing anything that he heard on that occasion.[226] This letter is a letter signed by Mr Sohan Singh, Barrister & Solicitor. He describes The Australian Institute of Hindi Language Studies Parents and Citizens Association Incorporated as his client and the plaintiff as the POI (person of interest). He says “We act for the abovementioned institute. We request an investigation…”, adding that “the secretary of the said institute has all the details”, and asking the police “to bring the offender to justice”.[227] It was the defendant’s raising of the allegations against the plaintiff, coupled with his statement about calling the police, which statements I have found were words calculated to bend not only the plaintiff but also members of the P&C Committee to his will, and the defendant cannot be heard to complain if, by taking his words literally and reporting the plaintiff to the police, the P&C has republished the allegations made by the defendant to the police for the purpose of having the plaintiff investigated. This is a very clear case of the defendant impliedly authorising the repetition, intending it to be republished and putting the P&C Committee in a position where, by reason of the nature of the allegations, there was a duty to republish. It was also the natural and probably consequence of the defendant’s statements that somebody would report them to the police is also an available finding.[228] Accordingly, all of the imputations pleaded and the substance of the matter complained of are republished, and a claim for damages for republication is made out for this publication.Mr Prasad’s letters (Exhibit F and H)[229] As to the two letters signed by Mr Prasad (Exhibits F and H), the defendant submits that Virendra Prasad was not at the meeting on 30 November 2008 and therefore the defendant cannot be liable for any republication by Virendra Prasad unless it is pleaded and proved that some person who heard the original slander passed it on to Mr Prasad, who then in turn republished it. It is submitted that it must then be proved that the chain of republication was the natural and probable consequence of the original slander. As there was no evidence adduced by the plaintiff to show that the defendant caused or instructed those letters to be sent, or otherwise authorised them, the plaintiff would fail “as a matter of logic” (written submissions paragraph 81) to establish the claim for republication. [230] This letter is for the purpose of a parents’ and P&C special meeting, and was allegedly written after the P&C had consulted “the legal advisor [sic]”. The brief outline of the situation contains the following assertion: 
     
     “Mr Shandil forged two signatures of two applicant teachers on the Teacher Profile Form which was submitted to the Department of Community Language Studies. This matter has been reported to the Mount Druitt Police for investigation on the instruction of the Schools [sic] Legal Advisor [sic]. If the Committee had not reported the matter, the Committee would have been concealing a serious criminal offence. 
      
      
     Mr Shandil was invited to show cause at the Executive Committee meeting held on 30 November 2008. He admitted that he had forged the signatures and it was an illegal act. He further said “What can you guys do?”” (Exhibit F) 
    [231] This is a very clear and very literal repetition of the matter complained of. The legal duties under which the P&C Committee operate (and I note that as a member of this committee, the defendant is technically a publisher) are set out in paragraph 2 and include s 19(3) Associations Incorporation Act 1984 (NSW), and r 10 of the school’s constitution.[232] As to the letter of 10 February 2009 to Mr and Mrs Kumar, I noted that this is again written in purport in an exercise of legal duties, namely to warn them that their actions were “wrong in law and contrary to our Constitution”. The letter goes on to state that the plaintiff was dismissed and that this disciplinary action “resulted from Mr Shandil forging two signatures of two teachers on the Teacher Profile Form that was submitted to the Department of Community Language Studies” (Exhibit H) and that they would also have been made aware that “this matter has been reported to the Mount Druitt Police for investigation.”[233] Both these letters are repetitions of the slander by the P&C Committee of which the defendant is a member, and pursuant to the principles of Webb v Bloch (1928) 41 CLR 331 he is thereby a publisher, whether his signature appears on the letter or not. He is similarly liable as a republisher on the same principles in Speight v Gosnay (1891) 60 LJQB 231, as are set out above.Findings concerning republication[234] I find that each of the three publications for which a claim for republication is brought is a publication for which the defendant is liable, because of the principles in Speight v Gosnay (1891) 60 LJQB 231. I further note he would also be liable because he is, at law, a publisher of each of these documents which republished the words he spoke on 30 November 2008.The defence of justification[235] Although the defendant, in paragraph 3 of the defence filed on or about 3 December 2009, only refers to a defence of justification under s 25 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), the written submissions at paragraph 135 states that the defendant also relies upon “common law justification”, a submission which is followed by the reference “[two] defence”. There is nothing in either paragraph 2 or 3 to identify any defence of justification at common law. The defendant makes no submissions concerning this defence, other than to note that the principles “are essentially the same as for s 25”. [236] For the reasons explained by the High Court in AON Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University (2009) 239 CLR 175, parties ought not to be permitted to rely on defences which are not pleaded or particularised. If I have erred in so holding, the matters which I have set out below in relation to the defence of justification, while they deal with the s 25 defence, would presumably also have application to any common law defence, if the defendant’s submissions at paragraphs 135-137 are taken at their face value.[237] The defendant has not pleaded any defence of contextual justification either at common law (“Polly Peck”) or pursuant to s 26 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW). The defendant’s submissions are silent as to the issue of what should occur in the event that I was to find one or more of the imputations not proved to be true, although submissions have been made in relation to mitigation of damages on this issue.[238] The defendant does concede that the standard of proof required would be s 140 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (as to which see Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd (1992) 110 ALR 449, as discussed by Levine J in Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 510 at [28]-[33]).[239] The first question for consideration is the elements which must be established in relation to proof of each of the imputations. I shall first set out the particulars of justification contained in the defence, noting that no additional particulars of justification were provided at any time:

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL and HOWIE AJ: The applicant was tried and convicted of an offence contrary to s 195(1)(b) of the Crimes Act (NSW) 1900. The indictment was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 16 November 2007 at Bidwill in the State of New South Wales did maliciously damage by means of fire certain property, namely a dwelling house situate at 8 Capparis Circuit, the property of the New South Wales Department of Housing.” 
        
       
      
    2 The offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 10 months to commence on 21 August 2008 and expire on 20 June 2013 with a balance of term of 1 year and 8 months to commence on 21 June 2013 and expire on 20 February 2015. 
     
      
    3 The applicant seeks to raise three grounds of appeal being: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Her Honour erred in assessment of the seriousness of the offence. 
       
       
      Ground 2: Her Honour failed to properly consider the effect of the applicant’s mental condition. 
       
       
      Ground 3: The sentence was manifestly excessive 
       
       
      The relevant facts 
       
      
    4 The applicant and his de-facto were tenants of the premises. They had both lived at the property since December 2005. It was the Crown case that they had grossly neglected the maintenance of the house which, with its surrounds, were in complete disarray and barely fit for habitation.  
     
      
    5 Shortly prior to 16 November 2007 the Mt Druitt Office of the Department of Housing had scheduled an inspection of the premises. On Thursday 15 November 2007 the applicant went to the Quix Service Station at Hassall Grove. At the service station he filled a container with petrol, and, after paying his bill, returned to his home.  
     
      
    6 Thereafter the applicant or his de-facto, or both of them, poured petrol in the hallway and rear bedroom areas of the house. The premises were then set on fire. The fire caused significant structural damage to the house predominantly in the hallway and rear bedroom side of the house. The damage was estimated at $70,000. 
     
      
    7 The sentencing judge found that the applicant had used the debris and rubbish in the home to assist in starting the fire. The applicant made no attempt to call 000.  
     
      
    8 Her Honour found that the applicant was motivated to light the fire because of difficulties he was having with the Department of Housing over the Department’s attempts to have the property cleaned up. 
     
      
    9 Her Honour found that the applicant and his de-facto believed that, if they set fire to the house, they would be eligible for emergency housing assistance which would obtain for them a new house and get them away from the filthy conditions they were living in, which her Honour described as being “like a rubbish dump.” 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    10 When considering the nature of the applicant’s offence, the sentencing judge identified the fact that there was no relevant standard non-parole period. However, her Honour proceeded to instruct herself that she was required to make findings as to matters of objective seriousness. Her Honour indicated the matters to which she would have regard and then concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “The objective seriousness is high. The need for general deterrence is significant. The damage was substantial and the required sale of the house depleted public housing required for the community at large.” 
        
       
      
    11 Her Honour then immediately proceeded to describe the damage, which she said was substantial, identified the fact that there was evidence of planning and that the applicant had abused a position of trust in relation to the property. Her Honour also identified the fact that the applicant was on bail for other offences when he committed this offence. 
     
      
    12 It is not entirely clear but her Honour’s remarks may indicate that she carried out the process of sentencing in two distinct stages. This would be a breach of the approach required to sentencing of offenders which was discussed by the High Court in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. When an offence attracts a standard non-parole period a court is required to determine the objective seriousness of the offence as a distinct step in the sentencing process. The position is otherwise in relation to offences that do not carry a standard non-parole period. The issue is addressed by McClellan CJ at CL in Sivell v R [2009] NSWCCA 286. See also the comments of Howie AJ in Georgopolous v R [2010] NSWCCA 246 at [31]-[32]; Okeke v R [2010] NSWCCA 266 at [32] per Howie AJ. 
     
      
    13 Although her Honour approached sentencing of the applicant using the language appropriate to an offence attracting a standard non-parole period, we are not persuaded that as a consequence the sentence, which her Honour imposed, was in error. On any view of the matter the criminality of the applicant was significant. The objective circumstances not being in dispute, the difficulty for the sentencing judge was in defining the appropriate sentence having regard to the apparent psychological difficulties. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    14 The applicant submitted that, because of the Judge’s approach to the objective seriousness of the offence, her Honour did not have appropriate regard to the evidence concerning the applicant’s mental state. That the applicant suffered from an impairment of his mental functioning was apparent from the evidence of Professor Greenberg and of Dr Ellis. 
     
      
    15 Although Professor Greenburg concluded that the applicant did not suffer from a “mental illness or mental disorder as defined within the meaning of Chapter III of the Mental Health Act 1900”, he did find that the applicant suffered from a severe Personality Disorder associated with Poly Substance Depression, and that he “probably would qualify for the diagnosis of Chronic Dysthymia (low-grade chronic depression) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder”. He thought that the applicant would probably benefit from a continuation of prescribed medication and further counselling. He recommended psychiatric assistance from a Community Mental Health Service on the applicant’s release. 
     
      
    16 Dr Ellis found that the applicant did not suffer from “a major mental illness such as a psychotic disorder”. However, he did diagnose a Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, polysubstance dependence, and an anti-social personality disorder. The doctor stated, as to the applicant’s mental state at the time of the offending: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is likely that he was abusing substances that would have exacerbated any underlying impulsivity and irritability that he experiences as part of his personality dysfunction……….It is likely given his underlying personality structure, possible cognitive impairments and substance use that his ability to reflect on decisions was impaired compared to the average person…..” 
        
       
      
    17 He thought that the applicant’s psychiatric medication “may be of some benefit in moderating impulsivity and aggression”. He also thought it might moderate “post-traumatic symptoms”. The doctor made other suggestions for treatment on the applicant’s release.  
     
      
    18 However, her Honour did not consider these matters to be of particular significance in the ultimate determination of the sentence. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is suggested that there are psychiatric factors that are relevant. The psychiatrist report from Dr Ellis which referred to and reviewed other reports was relied upon. 
         
         
        There has been no diagnosed mental illness or psychiatric disorder. The report suggests that the reporting of hearing voices may be an invention, although not a skilful one. On being questioned about this in court, Mr Watts agreed that he had been looking up books on mental illness and stated that he was looking up symptoms of depression because he thought that that might apply to him. His explanation makes no sense in the light of the report tendered and really throws doubt on the symptoms reported to the doctor by him. It would appear that Mr Watts is trying to manipulate the reports or the report writer. It is considered that any symptoms he is experiencing are as the result of substance abuse. The report writer, Dr Ellis, suggests Mr Watts has elaborated on other people’s probably real symptomology and claimed them as his own. I accept this observation. It was not challenged. Prior reports do not support a finding of mental illness or a condition related to the offending behaviour or any condition that appears to be related to the offending behaviour, or indeed any condition that on Mr Watts’ current presentation appears to be capable of treatment or improvement. 
         
         
        He is diagnosed as having an anti-social personality disorder. This diagnosis is associated with substance abuse. The offender is not amenable to involvement in any steps toward resolving this disorder that would require initially him to address his substance abuse issues. There is no evidence of developmental or intellectual disability. It is suggested he may have sustained some cognitive impairment from sustained alcohol abuse but that does not apparently stop him from attempting to manipulate the court report writer. It is observed that he displayed similar fanciful reports to previous report writers and I have referred specifically to the August 2007 report from Justice Health prepared by Doctor Greenburg.” 
        
       
      
    19 Later her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no support for the proposition that Mr Watts displayed or is diagnosed with any psychiatric or mental illness conditions relevant to the causation of this offence.” 
        
       
      
    20 Her Honour was referred during submissions to the decision of this Court in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228. That case is authority for the impact of the mental disorder of an offender on the sentencing of that offender. In particular it is not unusual for reference to be made to the following part of the judgment of Sperling J: 
     
      
       
        
        “[33]  
        Mental illness may be relevant — and was relevant in the present case — in three ways. First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced: Henry at [254];  
        Jiminez 
         [1999] NSWCCA 7 at [23];  
        Tsiaras 
         [1996 1 VR 398 at 400;  
        Lauritsen 
         (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [51];  
        Israil 
         [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23];  
        Pearson 
         [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]. 
         
         
        [34]  
        Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration: Pearce (NSW CCA, 1 November 1996, unreported);  
        Engert 
         (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71 per Gleeson CJ; Letteri (NSW CCA, 18 March 1992, unreported); Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]. 
         
         
        [35]  
        Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person: Tsiaras at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]. 
         
         
        [36] 
          
        A fourth, and countervailing, consideration may arise, namely, the level of danger which the offender presents to the community. That may sound in special deterrence; Israil at [24].” 
        
       
      
    21 As might be expected counsel for the applicant before the sentencing judge relied upon the first three factors set out in that part of the judgment. 
     
      
    22 With respect, her Honour seems to have misunderstood the submission being made. She treated reliance on that decision as a type of parity argument comparing the position of Ms Hemsley with that of the applicant, rather than as being a case relied upon simply as revealing a matter of sentencing principle. As a result her Honour rejected that decision as having any relevance because “the cases cannot be compared”. She came to that conclusion taking into account factors such as that Ms Hemsley had not served a period in custody before being sentenced, that she had a “different personality disorder” to the applicant and that she had used her period in custody “most productively”. None of those matters was relevant to an application of the matters set out in the quote above. 
     
      
    23 The most recent statement of the significance of an offender’s mental disorder is to be found in DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 where McClellan CJ at CL stated: 
     
      
       
        
        177 Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing: see, eg,  
        R v Engert  
        (1995) 84 A Crim R 67;  
        R v Tsiarias  
        [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; 
         R v Fahda  
        [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40] – [48];  
        Lauritsen v R 
         [2000] WASCA 203; (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [43] – [51];  
        R v Harb  
        [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35] – [45];  
        R v Israil 
         [2002] NSWCCA 255; 
         R v Hemsley  
        [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] – [36];  
        R v Verdins  
        [2007] VSCA 102 at [32];  
        Courtney v R  
        [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14]-[18]; and  
        R v Henry 
         [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. They can be summarised in the following manner:  
        
       
       
        
         
          Where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence:  
         R v Henry  
         at [254];  
         Miller v R  
         [1999] WASCA 66 at [23];  
         R v Jiminez 
          [1999] WASCA 7 
           
         at [23], [25];  
         Tsiaras  
         at 400;  
         Lauritsen  
         at [51];  
         Israil  
         at [23];  
         R v Pearson  
         [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43];  
         Henry 
          at [28]. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed:  
         Engert  
         at 71;  
         R v Wright  
         (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50 – 51;  
         Israil  
         at [22];  
         Pearson  
         at [42];  
         Henry 
          at [28]. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced:  
         Tsiaris  
         at 400;  
         Jiminez  
         at [25];  
         Israil  
         at [26];  
         Henry 
          at [28]. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence:

          Conversely, it may be that because of a person’s mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence:  
         Israil  
         at [24];  
         Henry 
          at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public:  
         R v Lawrence  
         (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23] - [24]. 
         
        
       
       
        
        178 I should stress that the mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to the sentencing process. The circumstances may indicate that when an offender has a mental disorder of modest severity it may nevertheless be appropriate to moderate the need for general or specific deterrence:  
        R v Skura  
        [2004] VSCA 53;  
        R v Verdins 
         [2007] VSCA 102; (2007) 16 VR 269 at [5].” 
        
       
      
    24 None of these considerations was addressed by her Honour. This was chiefly because her Honour saw the applicant’s mental disorders, whatever they be, as relevant only to the existence or otherwise of the mitigating factor under s 21A(3)(j) of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: that “the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his or her actions because of the offender’s age or any disability”. Clearly this factor did not apply, but the relevance of an offender’s mental disorder transcends a matter of mitigation under this provision. 
     
      
    25 But with respect the passage from the sentencing remarks quoted above, fails, in our opinion, to give due weight to the uncontested psychiatric opinions in evidence before her Honour. True it is that the applicant was not diagnosed with a mental illness or a psychiatric disorder as her Honour recognised, but that was only so far as those terms are relevant to the provisions of the Mental Health Act. We do not believe that either Professor Greenburg or Dr Ellis would agree that the applicant was not suffering from at least one mental disorder. Although the applicant may have been endeavouring to manipulate the psychiatrists, he failed in that attempt. There is no suggestion that the opinions of either psychiatrist were reached as a result of any false reporting made by the applicant. Nor do we understand her Honour’s finding that the applicant’s condition “appears to be capable of treatment or improvement”. This is inconsistent with the reports of both psychiatrists. 
     
      
    26 Further, contrary to her Honour’s statement that there was no support for a contention that the applicant psychiatric state was relevant to the causation of the offence, we have set out above a passage from the report of Dr Ellis in which he gives the opinion that the applicant’s mental condition may have resulted in his having less capacity than a normal person to reflect on his decisions. There is, in our opinion, some evidence of that in the applicant’s apparent reasoning that he would be in a better position with the Department if he burned down the house in which he was living.  
     
      
    27 In our opinion her Honour failed to take into account in an appropriate manner the psychiatric evidence. Minds might differ as to the severity of the applicant’s mental disorders, but it seems to us they were relevant both to an assessment of the applicant’s culpability for his actions and the degree to which the sentence should reflect general deterrence. This ground of appeal is made out. 
     
      
       
      A lesser sentence is warranted 
       
      
    28 Her Honour imposed a total sentence of 6 years and 6 months imprisonment. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years. The question that now arises is whether some lesser sentence is warranted. 
     
      
    29 The statistics from the Judicial Commission indicate that 90 offenders were sentenced for this offence between January 2002 and December 2008. Of these approximately two thirds were sentenced to a period of full time imprisonment. The middle 80th percentile of offenders for this offence were sentenced to total terms of between 2 and 4½ years with non-parole periods of between 1 and 2½ years. Accordingly the total term and the non-parole period imposed on the applicant exceed the highest sentence which has been recorded during that period. Having regard to these statistics it was submitted that given the actual loss suffered by the Department the sentence imposed on the applicant was erroneously excessive. 
     
      
    30 In response to the applicant’s submissions the Crown submitted that her Honour was required to have regard to the applicant’s motivation in attempting to burn down his dwelling. He sought by this act to benefit himself and obtain alternative premises. It was submitted that her Honour was also required to have regard to damage to the property and potential risk to the community if the fire had spread to adjoining premises. The Crown emphasised that the offence was planned and premeditated. 
     
      
    31 The applicant has a significant criminal history revealing a life of dishonesty with a number of failed attempts at rehabilitation. The Crown submitted that the applicant’s record did not justify any leniency. 
     
      
    32 The penalty imposed is greater than any penalty which has been recorded as having been imposed for the commission of this offence. The offence was a serious one because the applicant’s conduct was both planned and deliberate and occasioned significant damage to the premises. There was a real risk that the fire would spread to other property causing further damage and putting occupants’ lives at risk. 
     
      
    33 However, we are of the opinion that the sentence should have been mitigated to some extent by reason of the applicant’s mental condition. Yet the penalty should be a significant one and the deterrent effect of the sentence, while mitigated to some degree, should still be substantial. 
     
      
    34 We do not believe that there are special circumstances notwithstanding the applicant’s need for assistance on release. The applicant can receive treatment in custody and the parole period will be sufficient for him to further that treatment in the community if he is minded to do so. 
     
      
    35 We propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) application for leave to appeal is granted and the appeal allowed; 
       
       
      (b) the sentence imposed in the District Court is quashed and in lieu the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 4 years 1 month and a balance of term of 1 year 5 months. The sentence is to date from 21 August 2008. 
       
      
    36 SCHMIDT J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL and Howie AJ.

2413817,Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7,"Judgment 

1GILES JA: I agree with R A Hulme J. 

2ADAMS J: I agree with the judgment of R A Hulme J and with his Honour's proposed orders except for the refusal of leave to appeal. 

3A person who has been convicted is required to obtain leave before being able to appeal against his or her sentence, as provided by s5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Since applications for leave to appeal are always determined after full argument on the merits of an appeal, there are (rightly) no practical legal or other consequences following from a refusal of leave except, possibly, that the Court may retain its jurisdiction to hear and determine a subsequent appeal against the same sentence. If an appeal were unarguable or frivolous, it may be that leave should be refused but, in my respectful view, it is preferable to state such a view of the merits rather than make an empty order. Moreover, in this matter, the Crown did not seek that leave to appeal should be refused and, not surprisingly, no submissions on the point were made by Odgers SC for the applicant. With respect, I do not agree that such an order should be made on the Court's own motion. 

4R A HULME J: On 23 October 2009 the applicant was sentenced in District Court by her Honour Judge Tupman for two offences of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. One charge related to the drug known as ecstasy and the other related to cocaine. 

5The offences are contrary to s 24(2) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for life and/or a fine of $550,000. There is also prescribed under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 a standard non-parole period of 15 years. 

6The applicant asked that the judge take into account his guilt in respect of a further offence listed on a Form 1 document, the offence being there described as ""participate in criminal group"". It was taken into account in relation to the ecstasy offence but her Honour indicated that it did not warrant any increase in the sentence. 

7The sentence imposed for the ecstasy offence was one of eight years six months, with a non-parole period of six years, with effect from 20 April 2007. A concurrent sentence of six years six months, with a non-parole period of four years four months, was imposed for the cocaine offence. Accordingly the overall sentence was one of eight and a half years with a non-parole period of six years. 

8The applicant seeks leave to appeal but on a single ground which is confined to the length of the non-parole period imposed in respect of the ecstasy offence. 

Facts 

9Given the limited scope of the appeal it is unnecessary to set out much in relation to the detail of the two offences. They both involved activities carried out by the applicant in conjunction with others, and at the behest of others, in the course of preparing ecstasy and cocaine for distribution. In her remarks on sentence, after reciting the facts in detail, the judge expressed these conclusions about the ecstasy offence: 

""From these facts I accept that the offender on 19 April went with others to collect a quantity of ecstasy from the unit at Balmain which he put into the red bag and took to the factory premises at Kingsgrove. Whilst the facts are silent as to detail, I accept that the [ecstasy] he took to Kingsgrove was in powder form. I accept that he undertook some activity overnight to mix some of that powder so that it could be pressed into ecstasy tablets, but that was to be done by another. In any event I accept that it was his overall intention and role in this manufacturing business to mix the ecstasy powder with bulking agents and other substances so that another person in the enterprise could then press them into tablet form. That it would appear from the agreed facts was also his intention in relation to the 12.910 kilograms of ecstasy which remained at Rozelle and was located in the containers there"". 

10Her Honour then remarked that the applicant was stopped by police before he had completely fulfilled his intended role. She noted that it was common ground that the role played by the applicant was as a ""mixer and employee within this organisation"". 

11In relation to the cocaine offence the judge noted that it related to six kilograms of cocaine that had been found at a unit in Balmain. There was no indication in the statement of agreed facts of the applicant having done anything in relation to it prior to his arrest. However it was common ground that it was intended that he would mix the cocaine with other substances in order to ""bulk it up and subsequently have it available for supply"". 

12The judge accepted that the applicant's role was ""very much towards the bottom of the scale"". She accepted the concession by the prosecutor that the applicant should be viewed as ""an employee of those much higher up in this organisation"". She was satisfied that he was not a principal and that his involvement was limited to activity on two days, 19 and 20 April 2007. Whilst there was nothing in the agreed facts on the subject, the judge said that she was prepared to infer that the applicant would have expected to be paid for undertaking his task. 

Subjective features 

13The judge noted that the applicant was aged 41 at the time of sentence, having been 39 at the time of the offence. She described him as having a very lengthy criminal history, although she noted that there was only one drug supply matter in the past. The applicant had received punishments in various forms including full-time imprisonment. 

14The applicant had what was described as a difficult and dysfunctional upbringing. He left school at the age of 14. It was at that age that conflict between his parents apparently reached a point where his mother shot at his father and she was charged with conspiracy to murder him. She was eventually acquitted in respect of that charge. That fact, however, contributed to a number of difficulties experienced by the applicant in his teenage years including being bullied at school. His parents divorced following that event and the applicant remained with his mother. 

15He obtained employment with a relative after leaving school and although he had worked in number of different industries he had what the judge described as a ""good work record"" and she noted that he was capable of hard work. 

16The applicant had a very long standing substance addiction dating back to his early teens. It appears that he was consuming alcohol from an early age and then commenced to use cannabis from about the age of 16. He was smoking cannabis on a daily basis until his mid 20's. The report of Mr Tim Watson-Munro, psychologist, which was before her Honour set out the history of substance abuse. The applicant had used cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine and other stimulants such as LSD. Mr Watson-Munro noted that the applicant had not received much, if any, treatment over the years in respect of his substance abuse issues. 

17In addition to the negative impacts of substance abuse there were signs of cognitive and psychological impairment. The applicant had experienced head trauma on a number of occasions from events such as assaults and motor vehicle accidents. An MRI scan carried out in 2004 by a neurologist revealed signs of early frontal atrophy, the significance of which was uncertain. The scan was otherwise normal. Nonetheless there was a medical report from 2004 that was considered by Mr Watson-Munro, and which was before her Honour, that indicated that cognitive impairment was likely. 

18The following statement extracted from the opinions expressed at the conclusion of Mr Watson-Munro's report succinctly sets out the most salient matter for consideration: 

""It would hence appear that in many ways a "" perfect storm "" of clinical issues have converged with this man, inclusive of underlying psychogenic problems, possible brain damage and the aggravating impact of protracted substance abuse over the years which in turn have had a dramatic impact upon his judgement, impulse control and decision making"". 

19In the final paragraph of this report the applicant was described as presenting ""as a difficult treatment proposition"", although Mr Watson-Munro identified some positive aspects such as a stable employment history and the strong support he enjoyed from his fianc who had confirmed her strong commitment to him. 

Ground - The sentencing judge erred in the determination of the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence in respect of count 1. 

20The learned sentencing judge made a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which justified the imposition of a non-parole period for the ecstasy offence which was less than 75 per cent of the total sentence for that count. 

21Mr Odgers SC on behalf of the applicant submitted that the degree by which the non-parole period was reduced ""failed properly to reflect the finding of special circumstances"". It was contended that the finding was based upon a number of considerations, including: 


the applicant's dysfunctional upbringing; 

physical and emotional abuse by his mother; 

longstanding substance addiction emanating from early teens; 

serious psychological difficulties and symptoms of organic brain injury; 

cessation of drug use since going into custody following arrest in April 2007; and 

persistent high level anxiety, depression, despair and low self esteem. 

22The judge accepted that the applicant would need supervision in the community following release. This was: 

""to ensure that his complex psychological makeup does not lead to a relapse into drug use and therefore increase the possibility of committing offences. This supervision should be for a relatively lengthy time because of the long term nature of his psychological problems and their complexity"". 

23Her Honour found that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were ""reasonably good"" but noted that this was to a large extent dependent upon his ability to avoid relapsing into the use of prohibited drugs. She considered that supervision in the community for ""a relatively lengthy period"" would assist in that regard. 

24Her Honour first determined that a sentence in respect of the ecstasy offence of 8 years 6 months was appropriate. This was the result of a reduction of 35 per cent from the sentence of 13 years that she would have regarded as appropriate if not for the applicant's plea of guilty and some assistance he had provided. 

25Her Honour then announced: 

I find special circumstances, mainly the fact that his psychological condition requires supervision outside the gaol for a longer than normal period to ensure his rehabilitation, however for not much more than the statutory parole period would be. I propose a non-parole period of six years with a parole of two and a half years. 

26Principles applicable to the setting of the non-parole period of a sentence under s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are well settled and only brief reference is required. The following is not intended to be exhaustive. 

27The non-parole period is the minimum period of actual incarceration that the offender must spend in custody having regard to all the elements of punishment, including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of the offence and the offender's subjective circumstances: Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 at 627-629; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [59]; R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [34]. 

28A finding of special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact in respect of which this Court will be slow to intervene: Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [83]. 

29""As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive"": R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [19]; R v Cramp at [36]. 

30Simply because there are circumstances which are capable of constituting special circumstances, the court is not required to make such a finding and reduce the non-parole period: R v Fidow , above, at [22]. 

31The degree or extent of any adjustment of the ""statutory ratio"" is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge: R v Cramp , above, at [31]; Trad v R [2009] NSWCCA 56 at [33]. 

32Written submissions on behalf of the applicant include references to cases which discuss the relevance of concepts of mercy and rehabilitation to the question of setting the minimum term of a sentence: for example, Morgan & Morgan v R (1980) 7 A Crim R 146; and Bugmy v R [1990] HCA 181; 169 CLR 525. The passages relied upon in those judgments do not relate to appellate consideration of the discretionary decision made at first instance. 

33There have been many cases in which a finding of special circumstances has been made but this Court has concluded that the effective sentence imposed does not, either at all, or sufficiently, reflect that finding in the alteration of the statutory ratio. A number of cases in which this has occurred are cited in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Fina'i v R [2006] NSWCCA 134 at [31] to [40]. 

34One case of this type relied upon by the applicant is R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225. In that case the total term was 6 years 6 months and the non-parole period was 4 years 6 months. Howie J referred to the non-parole period as being about 70 per cent of the total term which, on his calculation, meant a reduction of 3 months from what would otherwise have been the non-parole period absent the finding of special circumstances. This, he said (at [30]), ""rather makes a mockery of a finding of special circumstances in response to the need his Honour found for extended supervision and counselling"". 

35In the present case the non-parole period is 70.6 per cent of the total sentence. The reduction from a non-parole period that would be 75 per cent of the total term amounts to 4.5 months. The important distinction, however, is that it is not apparent in Sutton that the sentencing judge said anything to indicate that he realised that the extent by which the non-parole period represented a departure from the statutory norm was as short as it was. In other words, it may well have been inadvertence or miscalculation that led to a non-parole period that was more than was intended by the finding of special circumstances. In the present case, the length of the non-parole period was precisely what the judge intended. 

36Where this Court has intervened, it has usually been the case that the sentencing judge has not given effect to a finding of special circumstances through inadvertence or miscalculation. Often this has occurred where sentences have been accumulated but it has occurred in single sentencing exercises as well. 

37There was no inadvertence or miscalculation in the present case. The sentence judge explicitly stated that she was satisfied that there should be some increase in the parole period on the sentence for the ecstasy offence because a longer period of supervision following release from custody was required. However, she also specifically stated that the increase she proposed would not be ""much"". 

38Mr Odgers referred in written submissions to what he termed the ""norm"" for non-parole periods in respect of Commonwealth offences being about 60 to 66 and 2/3 per cent of the total term: R v Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44 at 49; Murphy v R [2007] NSWCCA 18 at [16] - [25]. He submitted that for State offences, where there are special circumstances justifying an increase in the proportion of the sentence represented by the parole period, ""it would usually be appropriate to impose a parole period which reflected the norm for Commonwealth sentences"". 

39This submission lost some of its force with the recent decision of the High Court of Australia in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 where it was held (at [44]) that (in respect of Commonwealth offences) there should be no ""norm"" and that ""a sentencing judge should determine the length of the sentence to be served before a recognizance release order takes effect by reference to, and application of, the principles identified by this Court in Power [above], Deakin [[1984] HCA 31; (1984) 58 ALJR 367] and Bugmy [above]."" 

40Acknowledging this recent authority, Mr Odgers put in oral submissions that if a sentencing judge determines that it is appropriate to make a finding of special circumstances, although from that point the judge should be guided by general sentencing principles, nevertheless, regard should be had to the approach adopted by judges generally upon making such a finding. This would entail a recognition that often in such a case the non-parole period will be in the proportions that have been spoken of in the past in relation to Commonwealth sentences. 

41It is trite that sentencing judges must be guided by general sentencing principles but beyond that, I do not believe anything more needs to be said on the subject. The factual situations confronting a judge who has made a finding of special circumstances are so variable that no generalised proposition would suit every situation. To offer an obvious example, a non-parole period that is 50 per cent of the total term might be considered appropriate in a case where the total term is 2 years when it is felt necessary to allow for a 12 month period of parole. But it is almost impossible to imagine 50 per cent being appropriate where the total term is 20 years so as to allow for a 10 year parole period. Further, the total term of the sentence is but one of almost infinite considerations that may potentially be relevant. 

42This brings me to the point that the focus should not be solely upon the percentage proportions that the non-parole and parole periods bear to the total term. The actual periods involved are equally, and probably more, important. In the present case the judge's sentencing order allows for a potential period on parole of 2 years 6 months. There was no evidence before the judge that required a conclusion that this was insufficient to meet the purposes for which the judge found special circumstances. 

43Towards the conclusion of his oral submissions Mr Odgers put it that in the present case there was a ""powerful justification"" for a parole period of 3 years and that such a period would have been appropriate. Intervention by this Court to give effect to such a submission would entail a disregard of the sentencing discretion reposing in the judge at first instance. Moreover, a 6 month adjustment to the non-parole and parole periods, where the sentence is one of 8 years 6 months, would simply amount to tinkering. 

44The sentencing judge did not act upon wrong principles, fail to take into account any relevant matter, mistake the facts or arrive at a result that was unreasonable or plainly unjust. In my view there was no error in the manner in which she exercised her discretion. 

45I am of the view that there is no merit in the application. 

Orders 

I propose that leave to appeal be refused.

2413821,R v Mohamed SABRA [2011] NSWDC 161,"Judgment 

1 . I am sentencing a thirty-four year old limousine driver who drove a customer he knew to be a fourteen-year-old schoolgirl to a quiet location where he supplied her with alcohol and then sexually assaulted her when she was under the influence of that alcohol. 

2. As a result that man - Mohamed Sabra - was arrested and charged by the police with three crimes. The crimes are these. Aggravated indecent assault, the victim being under sixteen, is a crime against s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carried at that time a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. Parliament regards that crime as so serious that at the relevant time it had fixed a standard non-parole period of five years to that crime. The other two crimes were both aggravated sexual intercourse with a person between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. They are offences against s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act and carry a maximum of twelve years imprisonment. That offence does not carry with it a standard non-parole period. 

3. It is important when a judge sentences an offender for the judge to set out a brief account of what happened giving rise to the crime so that there is a public record of what behaviour the offender is being sentenced for. In this case the crimes occurred on a Saturday night, 6 December 2008. Mohamed Sabra owned and operated a limousine company named Sabra Limousines. He knew the victim of these offences. I will refer to as X because it is illegal to publish her name outside this courtroom. Mr Sabra had met X and driven her and a school friend to a concert about a month beforehand. On that occasion Mr Sabra learned that X was fourteen. 

4. On the night that Mr Sabra committed the crimes he picked up X and some friends from a party which they had attended at Bondi. X had been drinking alcohol at the party but there is no evidence - and I accept that - Mr Sabra knew that. During that day Mr Sabra and X had spoken to one another and made an arrangement for Mr Sabra to collect her. He picked her up at about half past nine and drove them around. Mr Sabra then told X that he had an appointment to pick up the singer named Kanye West. Apparently X was a fan of this singer and Mr Sabra told her that she could go with him and the facts - which are agreed between Mr Sabra and the prosecution - go on to record "" but that there would not be enough room for her friends "". 

5. X agreed and they drove into the city. Mr Sabra stopped to pick up some Red Bull energy drinks. He got a champagne glass from inside the car and mixed the Red Bull with vodka. The vodka was also in the car. He offered it to X and she eventually drank it. She then started to feel affected by the alcohol. 

6. What happened next is that Mr Sabra drove to an area and stopped. X believes that it was somewhere near the Art Gallery of New South Wales in the Domain. 

7. Mr Sabra said that he had a sore neck. He asked X for a massage, which she did. Mr Sabra then started massaging her shoulders. X got into the back seat and laid down. She passed out. When she awoke she found Mr Sabra's head was between her legs. He had his hand on her breast. He was licking her vagina. She felt his finger inside her vagina. 

8. The touching of the breast amounts to the aggravated indecent assault and the licking of her vagina and the placing of his finger inside her vagina constitute each of the aggravated sexual intercourse offences. 

9. As soon as she realised, X pushed Mr Sabra away and said "" Why would you take advantage of me? "" Mr Sabra replied by using her first name and asking "" Why are you crying? If you didn't like it why didn't you stop me? "" X continued to cry and Mr Sabra drove off with her because she asked him to take her home. She received a phone call from one of her friends and reported what had happened. She asked Mr Sabra to stop the car which he did. X complained to a passer-by. She then got back into the car and later Mr Sabra stopped the car so that she could use a bathroom in a hotel. She came back to the car and asked to be taken to Pyrmont where Mr Sabra dropped her off. Her friends were there. 

10. A few months later, on 19 February 2009, Mr Sabra was arrested. He was later charged with these offences. 

11. It is also important for a judge in sentencing an offender to have an appreciation of information which is personal to the offender. That comes from a number of sources in this case. 

12. There is a pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation and Parole Service. Mr Sabra was born in Lebanon and came to Australia when he was seven. His parents separated when he was ten and he was raised by his mother. He had and still has a close relationship with all his family members. 

13. He married. He has been married for some eleven years and he has two children. When the report was written they were eight and three. Understandably his marriage suffers from the strain of his offending behaviour. Mr Sabra described himself to the Probation Service as a moral and ethical family and community minded person. He was involved in various community activities. He finished year twelve at school and did a computer hardware engineer course. He joined his father in the family business of a limousine company. He had other businesses as well. 

14. He claimed to the Probation Officer when he was interviewed that he did not know that the victim was under sixteen. The report is dated 1 December 2010, so it appears that up until a short time before then that was the position he was asserting. The report also noted that he "" did not entirely agree with the police facts."" Nevertheless the report went on that he "" appeared to take responsibility for his offending behaviour. "" The report concluded that Mr Sabra "" presented as a confident and pleasant young man who, aside from raising two young children, appeared to be heavily involved in numerous business enterprises and community projects. Given his purported high moral standing and ethical commitment, it is difficult to understand his poor judgment and short sightedness in what would appear to be a normal evening of work in his line of business. "" The reporter thought that he was suitable for a low level of intervention from that service. 

15. There are reports from a forensic psychologist and two psychiatrists. The forensic psychologist Mr W John Taylor saw and assessed Mr Sabra on 25 November last year. Mr Taylor concluded that the tests were consistent with Mr Sabra not having any personality disorder, nor any emotional disturbance. Mr Taylor thought that Mr Sabra's "" lack of sensitivity "" for the victim was a factor "" which contributed to his offending behaviour, along with his tendency towards risk taking behaviour ."" Mr Taylor thought that Mr Sabra has a "" low risk of general and violent recidivism and a low/moderate risk of sexual recidivism."" Mr Taylor thought he had good prospects for rehabilitation which would be assisted by psychotherapy. 

16. Mr Sabra was also seen and examined by a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, who interviewed Mr Sabra on 22 November last year. Dr Nielssen noted a history which included Mr Sabra saying that "" as far as he was able to tell the girl invited him to make the advance and he did not go any further after she asked him to stop ."" He went on to tell Dr Nielssen that X was "" very friendly "" and "" very flirty "" in her behaviour. He told Dr Nielssen that he interpreted that to be sexual attraction and that she wanted him to make a sexual advance towards her. He said one thing led to another and the offences resulted. 

17. When asked about why he committed the offences, he told Dr Nielssen that ""he assumed it was something about her behaviour and circumstances that led him to believe that she arranged to be in the car with him by herself."" Dr Nielssen did not find any psychiatric disorder. He also expressed the opinion that Mr Sabra "" carries a low risk of further offences of any kind ."" Dr Nielssen noted that Mr Sabra "" expressed a high degree of shame and remorse for his behaviour."" 

18. I should add, before turning to the next psychiatrist, that Mr Taylor also recorded regret expressed by Mr Sabra described as "" going that extra step and cheating on my wife "". Mr Sabra told Mr Taylor he was "" wicked that minute. I regret it because of the way the girl feels now. She would feel angry and betrayed ."" He acknowledged to Mr Taylor that he was responsible and that he was "" older than her and more mature and I should have backed up and not gone ahead."" 

19. Mr Sabra saw a consultant psychiatrist Dr Adam Martin who arranged to see him for weekly psychotherapy. Dr Martin noticed that Mr Sabra "" appears genuinely distressed by what occurred and feels ashamed, and is concerned about the future consequences for his family."" 

20. X prepared a victim impact statement in which she recorded her reaction to being the victim of these crimes. She reported herself as feeling anxious, isolated and frustrated. She has difficulty sleeping. Amongst other things she feels "" sad, frustrated and angry that this had happened to me at such a young age. I feel he took away my innocence."" She reported nightmares and concerns about safety issues. She reported the social impact of the crimes. It became a topic of discussion amongst her peers, she was subjected to ""sexual assault jokes, rumours and gossip."" She wanted to move schools, finding that she felt completely isolated. She found it hard to focus on her year ten schoolwork. This she says was evident in the drop in her marks. She said she "" lacked motivation, was constantly tired (from difficulty sleeping) and often missed days of school, which furthermore affected my school certificate results ."" 

21. Before Mr Sabra pleaded guilty these charges had been listed for a defended hearing in this Court. X goes on to say that when the trial was due to commence in 2010, that was the year she began her year eleven. She said that due to frequent delays "" I missed weeks of school."" She said that she was "" unable to complete my year eleven final exams and my assessment week as these coincided with the Court trial dates ."" She said that due to "" under achieving at school and regularly missing school, I was unable to complete subjects I wished to do for my senior years."" She said she still feels dirty and the crimes have affected her body image and she has lost confidence in her appearance. She concluded by saying that she finds it "" hard to trust people and feel little self worth. I have had a lot of setbacks because of the assault, such as school marks declining, which prevented me from continuing my subjects of interest, the emotional abuse from peers and have had to attend regular counselling sessions to address many of these issues."" 

22. Mr Sabra has a criminal record. There are two entries in the record. They are both offences of importing a prohibited import which are Federal offences. On 9 June 2009 he was convicted of both of those offences and fined $1,000 in respect of each charge. Both Dr Nielssen and Mr Taylor in their original reports, which I have already referred to, recorded Mr Sabra as having no convictions. Dr Nielssen in a later report said that once he was told about the two convictions "" that did not have any effect on my opinion regarding the absence of any psychiatric disorder, and does not effect my opinion regarding Mr Sabra's remorse, his risk of committing any further offences and his prospects for rehabilitation ."" Mr Taylor also wrote to say that the previous offences that he was told of "" does not alter the opinions expressed in my original report ."" The prohibited imports comprised a particular form of human growth hormone. They had both been addressed to Mr Sabra using the name "" Michael Rossi "". Both offences were committed in March 2008, about a week apart. 

23. There was also admitted into evidence as part of Mr Sabra's case an article which had been published in the Sunday Telegraph of 23 January 2011. The item was accompanied by a photograph of Mr Sabra with the caption including the fact that he was "" charged with sexual assault on a fourteen-year-old girl "". The author of the article clearly had access to the agreed facts which I read from and the report accorded with those facts. 

24. Mr Sabra has pleaded guilty to the three offences and it is important for me to convict him of the three offences which I referred to at the commencement of these remarks. 

25. He was arrested on 19 February 2009 and committed for trial on 29 September 2009. He did not plead guilty until over a year later, on 11 October 2010. As Mr Grogan of counsel, the Crown Prosecutor who appeared in the sentence proceedings, said in his written submissions, the matter "" was listed for trial on several occasions and on one of which the complainant was required to give evidence ."" Mr Grogan argues that the utilitarian discount which he acknowledges should be awarded to Mr Sabra for pleading guilty, should be minimal and should be "" significantly less than the maximum of 12.5 per cent "" which is relevant in these circumstances in the Criminal Case Conferencing Trial Act 2008. Mr Michael Coroneos of counsel who appears for Mr Sabra in the sentence proceedings argues that the discount should be between ten per cent and 12.5 per cent. I propose to discount the sentence which I eventually impose by eight per cent. I have in mind the significant period of time between the committal for trial and the plea of guilty and the fact that the trial was listed for hearing a number of times and in fact commenced on one occasion. After he was arrested Mr Sabra had no time in custody. 

26. Both Mr Grogan and Mr Coroneos provided very helpful written submissions which they supplemented by equally helpful oral submissions in court. A number of issues were the subject of their submissions. One issue was the weight which I should give to X's Victim Impact Statement. Mr Coroneos reminded me that it was unsworn and that X was not crossexamined on her statement. On the other hand Mr Grogan pointed out that there was no request for her to be cross-examined after the draft was available for some time to the defence. He also argued that none of the reactions which X described in her Victim Impact Statement could be regarded as unusual. I would accept Mr Grogan's submission. The description by X of the consequences upon her of the crimes committed against her by Mr Sabra are hardly surprising. I add that I do not take the Victim Impact Statement into account against Mr Sabra as under s 23A (2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

27. Another issue agitated by counsel was whether the article published in the Sunday Telegraph should result in a mitigation of Mr Sabra's sentence because of the shame and embarrassment he has experienced and it should be regarded as punishment in addition to the punishment which I will impose for his crimes. I do not accept that submission. As Mr Grogan pointed out, the courts in this country are open and available for the public to attend. That includes of course the press. Publicity about offending behaviour is not an unusual accompaniment to sentence proceedings. Mr Coroneos argued that the article could have an impact upon the business but I accept Mr Grogan's submission that that was speculation. 

28. Another area of dispute was the contrition exhibited by Mr Sabra. I do accept that he has expressed some contrition for his offending behaviour. The contrition in my opinion complies with s 21A (3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I will take it into account in his favour. However, the extent to which I take it into account is limited. It is limited by a number of factors. One is that it was not supported by Mr Sabra himself going into the witness box and giving evidence. The second is that there are references in the reports which I have already referred to, to Mr Sabra not having a full appreciation of the seriousness of the offending behaviour which he participated in. At times he attributes responsibility to the fourteen-year-old schoolgirl upon whom he perpetrated these sexual violations. That was up to relatively recently. 

29. A piece of evidence I have not yet referred to was exhibit 4. Exhibit 4 comprises a folder containing qualifications and certificates which show that Mr Sabra has clearly advanced himself in qualifications in the area of his interest. More importantly the folder contains a significant number of references. The references point out that he is highly regarded within his family, amongst friends, in business relations and within the community. He is regarded as a hard worker. He is regarded as respectful and as a person who contributes to his family and to society. A large number of the people providing references have known Mr Sabra for many years. All of them know about the offences that Mr Sabra has been charged with. Most of them regard the behaviour as completely uncharacteristic. It seems that few, if any, of the persons knew about Mr Sabra's criminal record for importing prohibited imports. 

30. Clearly Mr Sabra is regarded as a person of good character, with some qualification, up until the present offences. I regard him too as a person who has exhibited the behaviour and characteristics of a person of very good character. The qualification is that he in fact was convicted of two offences. Also the references need to be seen in the context of the authors not knowing about those offences. Nevertheless much of what they attest to is consistent and clearly demonstrates that Mr Sabra is a man who is committed to his family, friends, a business and community. I think Mr Coroneos makes a good point in his written submissions where he says that "" the central theme in the majority of the character references is that the offences are totally out of character for the offender and that the offender has positive prospects for rehabilitation and that the offender is unlikely to reoffend ."" I accept that submission. I too regard what happened on this night as totally out of character so far as Mr Sabra was concerned. I think his prospects of rehabilitation are good and I think that he is unlikely to relevantly reoffend. 

31. I need to make an assessment of the objective seriousness against s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act because it carries a standard non-parole period. Mr Coroneos submitted that the objective criminality is at a low level. I would accept that submission to the extent that I would regard it as being in the lower third of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. I regard it as, however, towards the top end of that lower third, if I can put it that way, because of the age of the victim X. On the other hand the offence was of relatively short duration. Some offences of this kind could last much longer and be more persistent than the offence in this case. That is not to diminish the impact which the offence had on the victim in this case but so far as its relatively objective seriousness is concerned I regard it as being in the category which I have described. 

32. The seriousness of the two offences against s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act need to be seen in the context of the form of sexual intercourse which they took. Mr Coroneos correctly argues that there is authority for the proposition that digital penetration and cunnilingus can be regarded as not as serious as penile penetration. Once again, without diminishing the seriousness of what Mr Sabra has done, his crimes do not fall into a category where, for example, he might have inflicted full penile vaginal sexual intercourse upon the victim and ejaculated into her. The time might have been much longer than it took and it needs to be borne in mind that he did desist when he was asked. 

33. Returning briefly to the offence under s 61M of the Crimes Act, so far as the age of the victim was concerned it was, as Mr Coroneos argued, towards the top level of the range of offences for that crime. So far as that offence under s 61M is concerned though, I need to take into account that it was aggravated by the use of the alcohol which is an aggravating feature under s 21A(2)(cb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . I add that that aggravating feature does not apply to counts 2 and 3 because the offence is described in terms of the use of alcohol. 

34. I also do not find it as a statutory aggravating feature that there was any breach of trust involved but I accept Mr Grogan's submission that the "" character of the relationship "" is relevant to assessing why X was prepared to accompany Mr Sabra and why she was entitled to feel safe in his vehicle. She had felt safe on the previous occasion that she had used his service and as Mr Grogan argued it was "" in this context that she accepted the offender's offer for her to meet "" the entertainer "" and to leave her friends at the party to do so ."" Once again I emphasise that I do not regard this as constituting a statutory breach of trust under s 21A(2). I accept Mr Grogan's submission about the context. 

35. Mr Coroneos argued that it is open to me to impose a sentence which does not involve full-time custody. Section 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that I "" must not sentence an offender to imprisonment "" unless I am satisfied "" having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate."" Mr Coroneos argued that I could consider an Intensive Correction Order or that if I thought that penalties of two years or less were appropriate then I could suspend those sentences. I do not accept his submission. It is clear to me by the fact that Mr Sabra committed these serious offences in the circumstances that I have described that he must go to full-time gaol for these crimes. There are in my opinion no alternatives which are appropriate. Mr Grogan indeed argued that to sentence Mr Sabra otherwise than to a full-time custodial sentence would involve appellable error. 

36. I have had regard to the statistics published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales and to a number of decisions which were referred to in papers which were submitted to me and taken apparently from the Public Defenders' website. In particular there were two or three Court of Criminal Appeal decisions concerning offences against s 61M of the Crimes Act. 

37. For each of the offences against s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act I regard overall sentences of three years each as appropriate. For the offence against s 61M of the Crimes Act I regard an appropriate sentence as two years and three months. To those sentences I apply the eight per cent discount to which Mr Sabra is entitled because of the plea of guilty which he entered at the time that he did. That reduces the sentences for each of the offences against s 66C to two years and nine months each and the offence under s 61M to two years. 

38. I propose to partly accumulate the sentences. I accept that the crimes were all committed on the same occasion and very close in time to each other, but they are each a separate crime. Each of the touching of the breast, the act of cunnilingus and the digital penetration of X constituted a separate violation of her person. Each must be punished. 

39. Mr Coroneos argued that there are special circumstances for adjusting the relationship between the non-parole period and the parole period for the sentences. He pointed out that his client had not been in gaol before and that his prospects of rehabilitation were good. On the other hand, Mr Grogan pointed out that there was no significant need for Mr Sabra to be supervised. I propose to make some adjustment in the ratio between the non-parole period and the parole period, based upon the special circumstances which Mr Coroneos referred to. 

40. I propose to impose three sentences which will, in total, amount to three years and three months with an effective overall non-parole period of two years. That effective on-parole period of two years is just over sixty per cent of the overall head sentence. Normally, a non-parole period will be seventy-five per cent of the head sentence. 

41. The overall sentence will effectively date from today and will conclude on 10 May 2014. The non-parole period overall will date from today and conclude on 10 February 2013. 

42. For the offence of aggravated indecent assault against s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act , I set a non-parole period of eighteen months to commence today, 11 February 2011, and to conclude on 10 August 2012. The balance of the term will be six months, to commence on 11 August 2012 and to conclude on 10 February 2013. 

43. For the offence against s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act , being the cunnilingus, I set a non-parole period of seventeen months to commence on 11 May 2011 and expire on 10 October 2012. The balance of the term will be sixteen months to commence on 11 October 2012 and expire on 10 February 2014. 

44. For the second offence under s 66C(4), of digital penetration, I fix a non-parole period of eighteen months to commence on 11 August 2011 and expire on 10 February 2013. The balance of the term will be fifteen months to commence on 11 February 2013 and expire on 10 May 2014. 

45. The overall sentence is three years and three months commencing today, 11 February 2011, and expiring on 10 May 2014. The overall non-parole period is two years commencing today, 11 February 2011, and expiring on 10 February 2013. The first date upon which it appears you will be eligible for release is 10 February 2013. 

HIS HONOUR: Any factual matters, is the first question that I need to attend to. Anything I need to deal with under s 43, any correction of factual matters? No. What about the sentences themselves, the calculations, please, the dates? 

CORONEOS: It would appear your Honour's calculations are entirely correct. 

HIS HONOUR: They're correct, thank you. Ms Burgoyne? 

BURGOYNE: They appear to be correct. 

HIS HONOUR: Okay, thank you. I don't set parole, because Mr Sabra's sentence is over three years. In a moment I'll explain it to him. I don't think I'm going to recommend any parole conditions. There's nothing obvious, no. 

What I sometimes do, Mr Coroneos, and it's up to you, is that those who will classify Mr Sabra in Corrective Services this afternoon indicate that they benefit from any psychological or psychiatric material. There are three reports from Mr Taylor, Dr Nielssen and Dr Martin; the primary reports, I'm thinking of. I can arrange for my associate to fax copies of those to the section in Corrective Services which is responsible for that. She'll probably do that on Monday. 

CORONEOS: I certainly would ask your Honour to do that and I would thank your Honour for doing that. 

HIS HONOUR: Are you happy with me doing that? 

CORONEOS: I am, your Honour. 

HIS HONOUR: The alternative is they can accompany him with the warrant into custody now, but the disadvantage of that is I have marked them, and my associate will need to erase the markings. 

CORONEOS: It may be more appropriate for your Honour's associate to-- 

HIS HONOUR: And also the warrant done by the Sydney registry, and he's here. So we'll probably send them by fax on Monday. Is there anything else? No? Okay. 

46. Mr Sabra, you've heard the sentence which I've given. The overall sentence is three years and three months. It starts today. The sentence will finish on 10 May 2014. The non-parole period - that you have to stay in gaol, you're not released - is two years from today. It starts today, and you are eligible for release on 10 February 2013. Whether you're released or not is up to the Parole Authority, not to me. Do you understand that? Okay.

Date: 1919-04-09

Aurele Veuillette.
Appellant;

and

His Majesty the
King. Respondent.

1919: March. 24; 1919: April. 9.

Present: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington,
Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Mixed jury—Proceedings in one
language only—New trial—Substantial wrong—Art. 1019 Cr. C.

The appellant, being tried on an indictment
for murder, made a statement, by counsel, that the language of the defence was
French; and the trial judge directed the impanelling of a mixed jury. Each of
the six French-speaking jurors stated to the court at the time of their
selection that they understood and spoke both English and French. The trial
proceedings were carried on in the English language. The questions submitted in
a reserved case, and on which there was a dissent in the Court of King's Bench,
are: (1) The trial judge had not summed up the case to the jury in the French
language; (4) the trial judge had commented ""upon the failure of the
prisoner'' (who was a witness on his own behalf) ""to testify that he had
not actually committed the murder.""

Held, Brodeur
J. dissenting, that, even assuming these grounds to be errors in law
constituting, ""something not according to law * * * done at the trial or
some misdirection given,"" the conviction should not be set aside, as
""in the opinion of the court"" no ""substantial wrong or
miscarriage"" has been ""thereby occasioned"" to the appellant.
(Sec. 1019 Cr. C.)

Per Anglin and
Mignault JJ.—Though the terms of the trial judge's charge may be open to
criticism, the prisoner's evidence was open to comment by him as that of any
other witness.

Per Idington,
Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.—After the election by the accused for and the
empanelling of a mixed jury, he had a right to have the case conducted in both
English and French.

Per Brodeur J.
dissenting:—The failure by the trial judge to have summed up the case in French
constituted a ""substantial wrong"" to the appellant: the conviction
should be set aside and a new trial ordered.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec,[1]
affirming

[Page 415]

the judgment of the trial court, with a jury,
at Bryson, District of Pontiac.

The accused, appellant, was found guilty of
murder but he prayed for a case to be reserved for the Court of King's Bench.

The questions submitted in the reserved case
stated by the trial judge and the circumstances of the case are fully stated in
the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.

W. K. McKeown K.C. and A. J. McDonald for
the appellant.

Ernest Gaboury for the respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—I have carefully read and considered the
reasons for their judgment in this case given by the learned judges of the
Court of King's Bench and weighed carefully the able argument presented at bar
by Mr. McKeown on the prisoner's behalf.

The Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench
having dissented from the judgment of the majority of that court on the first
and fourth questions reserved, this appeal comes before us and is limited to
those two questions.

Assuming for the purpose of the argument that
the failure of the trial judge to charge the jury in both languages, French and
English, brings the case within section 1019  of the Criminal Code  as
""something not according to law done at the trial,"" we are by that
section expressly prohibited from setting aside the conviction or directing a
new trial unless in our opinion ""some substantial wrong or
miscarriage"" was occasioned thereby.

I am quite clear in my judgment that under the
special facts and circumstances of this case no such "" substantial

[Page 416]

wrong or miscarriage"" was so occasioned at
the trial to the prisoner either in the fact of the trial judge not having
summed up the case to the jury in French nor in the fact of his having
commented ""upon the failure of the prisoner"" (who had elected
to give evidence) ""to testify to the effect that he had not actually
committed the murders mentioned in the indictment.""

I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

Idington J.—I agree so entirely with the reasoning of Mr. Justice Cross in
his opinion given in the court below that I adopt same so far as applicable to
that part of the reserved case presented for our consideration. I only desire
to add a few words thereto, suggested to my mind by the argument for appellant
insisting upon everything said in evidence being translated and addresses
repeated in two languages.

I not only dissent from the view expressed by
the learned Chief Justice relative to the first question submitted, but also
submit with great deference that the adoption of such a rule as he suggests in
such a case as now in question, where everyone concerned assumed, throughout a
long trial that the jurors understood the English language used, might be
fraught with injury to an accused. There is no other class of criminal trials
which produces such a strain upon the minds of those concerned as does a trial
for murder. There would inevitably result, from a repetition in two languages
of all that was expressed, a prolongation of the trial tending to fatigue and
inattention on the part of the jurors and possibly a confusion of thought which
tiresome reiteration is apt to produce.

The just rights of an innocent man might be
needlessly jeopardized in such a case.

[Page 417]

The statutory right given an accused and now in
question had originally a deeper import than the mere right to the use of the
two languages. The latter right in substance is recognized in the due and
proper administration of justice wherever and whenever, and so far as
necessary; though not carried to the extent that the law in question does
relative to the selection of a jury.

The right to a jury de medietate linguae is
entirely of English origin, tracing back to Edward I., and so clearly formed
part and parcel of English law that I imagine it was by reason thereof that it
became law in so many of the United States, until abolished in all save
Kentucky. If, instead of what happened by steps needless to dwell upon here,
the English law had finally become the law of all Canada as result of the
Conquest, it would have been as, of course, part thereof, but the final
settlement of that vexed question carried with it modifications of the French
law, of which this is one and it, no doubt, was intended to protect him accused
from racial prejudices in the jury panel. To impose upon him accused and thus
protected the additional risks I have adverted to, when and so far as needless,
might tend to force him to waive his privilege, when standing in need of its
exercise, for no other reason than that he might desire and need the
sympathetic hearing of those of his own or like origin to counteract the
possible prejudice of those of another origin.

I do not think he should be driven to make such
a choice. At the same time I must not be understood as implying any limitation
upon his right to insist, if so advised, upon the two languages being used
throughout the trial.

If well advised, common sense will generally
govern him and his counsel in regard to the exercise of any

[Page 418]

such rights. And the court must always be ready
to accede to his wishes, as I have no doubt it did herein.

I cannot imagine that any wrong or miscarriage
of justice ensued herein by reason of the course pursued at the trial; with the
concurrence of all concerned,

The case was not one that, so far as we are
informed, needed anything but the ordinary conversational skill in use of
language to apprehend what was said.

Cases are conceivable in which terms might be
used calling for more than that degree of skill. Then, of course, care must be
taken that each set of jurors fully understands the import of what is said.

In cases of trial for murder, where there is a possible
alternative, of the crime being reduced to one of manslaughter, it frequently
happens that nice distinctions of law need to be observed and in explaining
such distinctions it might be well for a judge charging a jury to make such
distinctions clearly understood by using both languages, lest a juror might not
understand same when addressed in another than his mother tongue, even if he
had acquired the facility of carrying on an ordinary conversation in another
language. But in a murder trial such as this happened to be where it was
inevitably either murder or nothing, all the jurors had to understand was the
statement of plain ordinary every-day facts.

I am of the opinion that the appeal should be
dismissed.

Anglin J.—The facts of this case sufficiently appear in the judgments
delivered in the Court of King's Bench. The appeal to this court was confined
to two of the four questions submitted by the reserved case— the first and the
fourth—on which the learned Chief Justice of Quebec dissented from the majority
view in the Court of King's Bench adverse to the prisoner.

[Page 419]

The first question is as follows:—

Having regard to the facts, that the
accused elected to be tried by a jury composed of one-half of persons skilled
in the French language, and that the jury in question was in fact composed
one-half of persons skilled in the said French language, was there error of law
on the part of the presiding judge, occasioning substantial wrong or
miscarriage, in not having summed up the case to the jury in the French
language in addition to the summing up made in the English language?

On the reserved case submitted, it may properly
be assumed that the appellant was entitled to be tried by.

a jury composed for the one-half at least
of persons skilled in the language of his defence

(in this case French), that upon arraignment he
duly demanded such a jury (27 & 28 Vict., ch. 41, sec. 7, subsec. 2), and
that at least six members of the jury impanelled were

found in the judgment of the court to be
skilled

in the French language.

I am inclined to agree with the learned Chief
Justice of Quebec that

after the election of the accused for a
mixed jury, and after the impanelling of such a mixed jury, the case should
have been conducted in both languages.

That, in my opinion, was a right of the accused
implied by the statute. If not, its object would be purely sentimental and no
right real and substantial in character would be conferred by it. There is not
a little in the record to indicate tacit consent by the accused to the trial
being conducted entirely in English. The learned Chief Justice questions the
sufficiency of this consent although apparently of the view that

the consent of the accused expressly obtained
and recorded

would have justified that course being adopted.
I find it unnecessary to pass upon this aspect of the case.

No question is presented as to the effect of the
omission to translate into French the evidence given

[Page 420]

in English. The question submitted is confined
to the failure of the trial judge to repeat his charge or summing up in French.

Assuming in favour of the appellant that the
omission to repeat, at least in substance, the charge or summing up was error
in law, it would have constituted

something not according to law * * * done
at the trial

and would justify setting aside the conviction
and ordering a new trial only if

""in the opinion of the court of appeal
some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the
trial.""

of the court of appeal some substantial wrong or
miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial."" Crim. Code, sec. 1019. I
cannot accede to the contention of counsel for the appellant that, because the
error complained of was one of omission and not of commission, it is not within
the purview of section 1019. The omission of that which should have been done,
made that which was done ""something not according to law,"" and,
therefore, a matter to which the section applies. The question submitted
properly so assumes.

The stated case informs us that

each and every one of the jurors stated to
the court at the time of their selection that they understood and spoke both
languages. When the first witness speaking English gave his evidence, the
French-speaking jurors were asked by the court if they understood the evidence,
and they all replied that they did. The Crown prosecutor, in explaining the
case to the jurors spoke only in English, and Mr. McDonald, attorney for the
accused, in addressing the jury after the evidence had been received, spoke
only in English, He was followed by Mr. Gaboury, Crown prosecutor, who
addressed the jury in English only and was followed by the presiding judge who
addressed the jury in English only. No objection was made by the defence and no
request preferred that the charge of the jury be repeated in French.

It was also stated at bar that the accused
himself gave his evidence wholly in English.

Having regard to all these facts, I agree with
Mr.

[Page 421]

Justice Pelletier that the accused suffered no
prejudice —that no substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned on the
trial—by the failure of the trial judge to repeat in French his entire summing
up or the substance of it.

The affidavits of some jurors tendered by the
appellant are, in my opinion, inadmissible and I have not considered them for
any purpose.

The fourth question reserved is as follows:—

Was there error of law occasioning
substantial wrong or miscarriage in that the judge who presided commented upon
the failure of the prisoner to testify to the effect that he had not actually committed
the murders mentioned in the indictment?

Although the dissent of the Chief Justice is in
terms confined to the first and fourth questions the reasons which he assigns
rather indicate that he was not entirely satisfied that the third question should
be answered in the negative. Perhaps, however, broadly construed—and I so deal
with it—the fourth question may cover the ground of objection which the learned
Chief Justice had in mind when he said:—

In his address the judge said to the jurors
that the accused did not dare to swear that he did not kill the murdered man.
Such a comment, in my opinion, is against the spirit of the law. It was not a
fair comment and it was of a nature to cause a substantial wrong and
miscarriage of justice.

The prisoner having testified on his own behalf
his evidence was open to comment and observation by the presiding judge in
addressing the jury as was that of any other witness. Mr. Justice Cross
disposed satisfactorily of this branch of the case. Dealing with the third question,
he says of the portion of the charge to which the learned Chief Justice takes
exception:—

It is to be observed that the jurors were
there to hear the evidence and that if there were inaccuracies upon the facts
in what the judge said they would not constitute misdirection unless it could
be said that they had, or were likely to have, some such effect as to lead the
jury to think that some question which they ought to consider was in law
excluded from their consideration, or otherwise mislead them as to the law.

[Page 422]

Whatever may be thought of the learned trial
judge's charge from other points of view, however open to criticism it may be
as a departure from the standard of impartiality which judges entrusted with
the administration of the criminal law in the English courts have thought it
proper to adopt, I cannot find in it any error of law such as may properly be
made the subject of a reserved case under arts. 1014 et seq. of the
Criminal Code . I entirely agree, however, with Mr. Justice Pelletier's
observation:—

Il est évident que le juge a tenu un
language énergique, pour ne pas dire plus, mais il n'y avait dans tout cela
aucune direction erronée sur aucun point de droit, et je ne crois pas que cela
puisse faire annuler le verdict.

The appeal, in my opinion, fails.

Brodeur J. (dissenting).—L'appelant, Veuillette, a été trouvé coupable de
meurtre et a demandé au juge qui présidait à son procès de réserver certaines
questions pour la décision de la cour d'appel, et notamment celle de savoir si
dans le cas où il y a un jury mixte le juge doit faire son allocution (charge)
dans les deux langues.

Le juge ayant refuse cette demande, Veuillette
s'est adressé à la couy d'appel pour obtenir l'autorisation d'appeler de cette
décision. Il a produit au soutien de sa demande les affidavits de quatre jurés
de langue française qui ont déclaré n'avoir qu'une connaissance imparfaite de
l'anglais; et Fun d'eux, le nommé Demers, a même ajouté:—

Il y a beaucoup de choses qui ont été dites
pendant le procès de Veuillette et dans la charge au jury du juge Weir que je
n'ai pas comprises.

La cour d'appel a accordé sur cette preuve la
permission d'appeler (art. 1015  Code Criminel ).

Quatre questions ont été soumises à la Cour
d'Appel. La première est dans les termes suivants:—

[Page 423]

Having regard to the facts that the accused
elected to be tried by a jury composed one-half of persons skilled in the
French language, and that the jury in question was in fact composed one-half of
persons skilled in the said French language, was there error of law on the part
of the presiding judge, occasioning substantial wrong or miscarriage, in not
having summed up the case to the jury in the French language in addition to the
summing up made in the English language?

En vertu de la loi actuellement en force dans la
province de Québec, où ce procès criminel a eu lieu, le prévenu, s'il est
français ou anglais, peut demander, lors de sa mise en accusation, un jury
mixte

et alors il sera jugé par un jury composé
pour moitié au moins des personnes qui * * * seront * * * versées dans la
langue du prévenu. (1864, 27-28 Vict., ch. 41, sec. 7).

Comme on le voit par le texte même du statut,
c'est un droit absolu pour un anglais ou un français dans la province d'être
jugé par six au moins de ses concitoyens qui parlent sa langue máternelle. Ce
n'est pas même laissé à la discrétion du juge de décider s'il y a eu lieu ou
non d'accorder cette demande du prévenu pour un jury mixte. C'est un droit
absolu et incontestable. Et du moment qu'il manifeste ce désir, le juge est
tenu d'en prendre note et de voir à ce que le jury soit mixte.

Cette législation n'est pas nouvelle. Elle
remonte aux premiers jours de la domination anglaise. En 1764 le gouverneur
Murray, dans son ordonnance du 17 septembre, déclarait que

In all tryals in this court, all His
Majesty's subjects in the Colony to be admitted on juries without distinction.

Les canadiens de langue anglaise se sont trouvés
fort mécontents de voir que cette ordonnance mettait les anglais et les
français sur le même pied; et, dans un mémoire en date du 16 octobre 1764, ils
disaient que

persons professing the religion of the
Church of Rome * * * have been empannelled on Grand and Petty Jurys even
where two protestants were parties.

Ils rappelaient cette disposition de la loi
James the Third, ch. 5, sec. 8, qui déclarait que

[Page 424]

no papist * * * shall practice the Common
Law as a Chancellor Clerk, Attorney or Solicitor, etc.,

et ils concluaient en disant:—

We therefore believe that the admitting of
persons of the Roman Religion * * * as jurors is an open violation of our most
sacred Laws & Libertys and tending to the utter subversion of the
Protestant Religion & His Majesty's Power, authority, right &
possession of the province to which we belong.

(Constitutional Documents, Shortt & Doughty,
p. 154.)

Leurs plaintes furent referees
en Angleterre où les officiers de la couronne décidèrent
que les catholiques pouvaient agir comme jurés. Et en 1766,
le 1er juillet,
une nouvelle ordonnance, destinée à faire disparaître la plainte des anglais
qu'ils étaient exposés à être jugés par des jurés tous français a été signée
décrétant que dans les actions

between British-born subjects and
Canadians, the juries are to be composed of an equal number of each, if it be
required by either of the Parties.

Shortt & Doughty, idem, p. 173.

Le jury mixte était établi et ce sur les représentations et à la demande des
canadiens de langue anglaise. Nous retrouvons le principe de cette législation
dans nos Statuts Refondus du Bas-Canada, dans la section 31 du ch. 84. Ce dernier statut ayant été abrogé en 1864, la disposition en question a été reproduite dans le statut de 1864, 27 & 28 Vict. ch. 41, sec. 7. C'est la loi maintenant en force.

Maintenant, quelle est l'étendue du droit qui était
conféré aux prévenus?

On a prétendu que ce droit ne consistait que dans
le choix des jurés et ne comportait pas l'obligation pour la cour de voir à ce
que toutes les procédures soient conduites dans les deux langues afin d'être
bien comprises par tous les membres du jury.

Ce serait, suivant moi, un droit bien illusoire si,
malgré le droit qu'aurait un anglais,
par exemple, de

[Page 425]

choisir un jury mixte, il était permis à la
couronne de faire entendre les témoins en langue française et de ne pas
traduire leurs témoignages en anglais de manière à ce que la teneur de ces
témoignages fût comprise par les jurés de langue anglaise. Cela constituerait
un grave déni de justice.

Il en serait de même pour le résumé (charge) du
juge. Ce dernier devrait voir à ce que son allocution soit comprise de tout le
jury.

Il est vrai que la loi est silencieuse sur la
manière dont une cause devra être conduite devant un jury mixte. Mais je ne
veux pas de meilleure interprétation de la loi que cette pratique, constamment
suivie depuis plus de cent cinquante ans, que dans le cas de jury mixte les
dépositions des témoins sont traduites dans les deux langues et le résumé du
juge est également fait ou traduit en anglais et en français.

Le gouverneur Murray sentait si bien la nécessité pour les préposés de l'administration de
la justice de connaître les deux langues, que, dans un rapport qu'il faisait
aux autorités impériales il se plaignait que

our chief Judge and Attorney-General are
both entirely ignorant of the language of the natives.

De fait, quelques mois après les autorités
impériales, sans motiver leurs raisons, remplaçaient le Juge en Chef et le
Procureur General. Shortt & Doughty, idem, p. 178,

Mais on dit: Il n'y a pas eu de protestation dans
la cause actuelle quand le juge a omis de parler en français, le prisonnier a
donné son témoignage en anglais, son avocat n'a parlé qu'en anglais quand il a
fait son allocution aux jurés, et, de plus, on a demandé aux jurés français s'ils connaissaient l'anglais et ils
ont répondu que oui.

Toutes ces circonstances ne sauraient prouver qu'il
y a eu acquiescement formel à cette illégalité. Je me

[Page 426]

demande même si dans un procès pour meurtre un
acquiescement formel serait suffisant. La loi criminelle exige que dans les
procès qui peuvent entraîner la peine capitale toutes les précautions doivent
être prises pour que toutes les règles de la procédure soient suivies avec la
plus grande rigueur. (Russell on Crimes,
vol. 3, p. 2156.)

Nous avons au dossier une preuve énonçant que
certain juré n'avait pas une connaissance suffisante de l'anglais pour
comprendre tout ce qui a été dit par le juge et les témoins.

Nous avons également au dossier un fait qui ne
porte pas, il est vrai, sur la question que je suis à examiner, mais qui
démontre bien l'importance d'avoir tous les témoignages bien traduits. L'un des
témoins donne son témoignage en anglais et rapporte une conversation de
l'accusé qui était cependant tenue en français. On lui demande de répéter en
français le texte de cette conversation. Il y a une variante importante. On la
signale au témoin et il est obligé de dire:—

The way they rattle me up is in French and
English. I have a little of both and all the words are mixed up.

Ce témoignage est des plus importants dans la
cause. Nous voyons que la version anglaise donnée par le témoin de cette
conversation incrimine bien plus l'accusé que les mots dont ce dernier se
serait servi d'après ce même témoin quand il rapporte le texte français. Ce
texte français ne paraît pas avoir été traduit en anglais aux jurés et nous
trouvons dans le dossier le fait que certains jurés ne comprenaient pas du tout
le français.

Tout cela démontre l'importance qu'il y a de
conduire la cause dans les deux langues et le danger qu'il y a de ne pas le
faire.

[Page 427]

Pour maintenir le verdict, l'intimé se base aussi
sur le fait que l'avocat de la défense n'a pas parlé aux jurés en français.

L'accusé était évidemment un adolescent bien
pauvre, sans famille et sans protection. Il a trouvé dans son jeune défenseur un homme bien dévoué qui a évidemment entrepris
cette cause sans l'espoir de toucher un sou d'honoraire. Mais, comme cet avocat
le dit lui-même dans son factum

he was a very young member of the bar, and
had not then the advantage of the experience which he has since acquired, was
lead into the error of following the action of Crown counsel and of the
presiding judge.

J'en suis venu à la conclusion que dans les
circonstances le fait pour le juge de ne pas avoir fait son résumé dans les
deux langues constitue un tort réel à l'accusé (art. 1019 
Code Criminel ); et en cela je partage l'opinion de
l'honorable juge en chef de la province.

Le jugement a quo
qui a répondu négativement à
la question dont j'ai donné le texte plus haut devrait être renversé. La
sentence devrait être annulée et un nouveau procès devrait avoir lieu.

L'appel devrait être maintenu avec dépens.

Mignault J.—L'appelant, qui a été
trouvé coupable de meurtre par un jury dans le district de Pontiac, province de
Québec, aux assises criminelles y tenues en avril 1918,
présidées par l'honorable juge Weir,
a obtenu de la cour d'appel que quatre questions de droit
fussent réservées pour l'opinion de la dite cour. Après avoir entendu le
conseil de l'appelant et le conseil comparaissant pour la couronne, la cour
d'appel répondit négativement aux questions soumises et confirma le verdict et
la sentence de mort prononcée contre l'appelant, l'honorable juge en chef
exprimant son dissentiment quant aux réponses données à la première

[Page 428]

et à la quatrième des questions ainsi réservées,
auxquelles il était d'avis de répondre dans l'affirmative. Ce dissentiment
ayant permis un appel devant cette cour, l'appelant nous demande d'infirmer la
décision de la cour d'appel, son appel se trouvant restreint aux questions au
sujet desquelles l'honorable juge en chef a exprimé son dissentiment. Je vais
donc me borner à ces deux questions, la première et la quatrième.

Première Question.

Having regard to the facts that the accused
elected to be tried by a jury composed one-half of persons skilled in the
French language, and that the jury in question was in fact composed one-half of
persons skilled in the said French language, was there error of law on the part
of the presiding judge occasioning substantial wrong or miscarriage, in not
having summed up the case to the jury in the French language in addition to the
summing up made in the English language?

Le droit d'avoir un jury mixte dans
la province de Québec a été reconnu par la loi passée par le parlement du
Canada en 1864, 27-28 Vict. ch. 41, sec. 7, sous-section 2, qui se lit
comme suit:—

2. Si le prévenu, lors
de sa mise en accusation demande un jury composé, pour une partie au moins, de
personnes parlant la langue de sa défense, si cette langue est le français ou
l'anglais, il sera jugé par un jury composé pour moitié au moins des personnes
dont les noms se trouvent successivement les premiers sur le tableau et qui
lors de leur comparution n'étant pas légalement récusées seront, d'après
l'opinion de la cour, versées dans la langue du prévenu.

Cette disposition légale est en pleine vigueur, et
il a été jugé que l'abrogation qu'en a prétendu faire la législature de Québec
par la loi 46 Vict. ch. 16, dépassait la compétence de cette législature, le droit criminel et la
procédure criminelle étant du ressort exclusif du parlement canadien. The Queen v. Yancey[2].

En 1873 la cour d'appel, composée du juge en chef Duval, et des honorables
juges Drummond, Badgley, Monk et
Taschereau, a jugé, dans la cause de Reg. v. Chamaillard[3]:—

[Page 429]

That where it is discovered after verdict,
in a case of felony, where half of the jury were ostensibly sworn as being
skilled in the French language (being that of the prisoner) that one of such
half was not skilled in the French language, the trial and verdict are
unlawful, null and void, and will be vacated and set aside on a reserved case
by the judge in the court below.

En 1897, le juge Wurtele a décidé dans
la cause de The Queen v. Shehan[4], que

When the accused asks in the Province of Quebec for a mixed jury, it
must be granted as a matter of right; the abandonment, by the accused, of the
order for a mixed jury is not, however, a matter of right, but may be allowed
by the judge.

Plus tard, dans la cause de The
Queen v. Yancey[5], le même juge a décidé que

The words ""language of the
defence,"" in subsection 2 of section 7 of the statute of the Province of
Canada, 27-28 Vict., ch. 41, which is still in force in the Province of Quebec,
mean the language of the prisoner, and not the language in which his defence is
to be conducted. The privilege of the prisoner is to claim a jury composed for
one-half at least of jurors speaking or skilled in his language.

Enfin, en 1892, la cour d'appel, composée du juge en chef Sir Alexandre Lacoste, et des
juges Blanchet, Hall, Wurtele et Ouimet, a jugé dans la cause de The King v. Long[6],
que

Where an English-speaking prisoner in the
Province of Quebec is represented at his trial by counsel speaking the French
language, and no request is made for a translation of the testimony of
French-speaking witnesses into English, for the benefit of the prisoner,
failure to so translate as to enable the prisoner to personalty understand the
evidence is not a limitation of his right to make ""full answer and
defence'' to the charge, and will not invalidate a conviction.

Le juge Wurtele a parlé au nom de la cour d'appel, et on voit qu'il ne s'agissait pas
là d'un procès criminel instruit devant un jury mixte, mais du choix librement
accepté d'un jury composé entièrement de personnes de langue française. Le cas
ne se présentait pas sous l'operation de la loi 27-28 Vict. ch. 41, et l'opinion
du

[Page 430]

même juge dans les causes de The Queen v. Shehan[7],
et The Queen v. Yancey[8], fait voir la distinction qui existe entre ces
espèces.

Enfin, je dois mentionner une cause du Manitoba, où le jury mixte existe également,
mais dans l'espèce on ne paraît pas avoir procédé devant un jury ainsi composé.
On a y jugé (Reg. v. Earl[9]) :—

The fact that one of the jury sworn to try
the prisoner did not thoroughly understand the English language is no ground,
after trial and conviction, for holding that there has been a mistrial, or for
granting a new trial.

It is too late to challenge a juror after
he has been sworn, even if the ground for challenge was not known at the time.

Ignorance of the English language would not
in this province be a ground of challenge of a juror.

The provisions of section 746  of the
Criminal Code  respecting the granting of a new trial, when it is imperative,
and when discretionary, explained.

Revenant maintenant à la disposition de la loi 27-28 Vict. ch. 41, il est clair que cette disposition serait illusoire si, dans un procès
instruit devant un jury mixte, les témoignages n'étaient pas traduits du
français en anglais, et réciproquement, et si l'adresse du juge présidant le
procès n'était pas faite, du moins quant à ses parties essentielles, dans ces
deux langues. Telle a toujours été la pratique en la province de Québec, et le
savant conseil de l'intimé devant nous, Mtre. Gaboury, en réponse à une
question que je lui ai posée, a admis que cette pratique était aussi suivie
dans le district de Pontiac. Je suis donc d'opinion que le prisonnier qui
demande un jury mixte a le droit d'avoir un procès instruit dans les deux
langues, française et anglaise, ce qui comprend bien l'adresse du juge au jury.

On invoque le fait que dans cette cause les jurés
de langue française ont déclaré lors de leur assermentation

[Page 431]

qu'ils comprenaient l'anglais, que lorsque le
premier témoin a témoigné en anglais, les jurés de langue française, interrogés
par le juge, ont répondu qu'ils avaient compris son témoignage, que le
défenseur du prisonnier avait parlé l'anglais dans son plaidoyer au jury, et
que le prisonnier lui-même avait rendu son témoignage en anglais. De là on
conclut qu'il y a eu acquiescement du prisonnier à l'instruction du procès dans
la langue anglaise.

J'hésiterais beaucoup à conclure du silence du
prisonnier, ou même du fait qu'il a donné son témoignage en anglais, qu'il a
renoncé à un droit indubitable qui découle de son choix d'un jury mixte, celui
de faire instruire son procès dans les deux langues. Mais puisje dire qu'il y a
dans cette cause ce que la question soumise appelle ""substantial
wrong or miscarriage,"" sans quoi, aux termes de
l'article 1019  du Code Criminel ,
un nouveau procès ne peut être ordonné?

Mon honorable collègue, M. le juge Brodeur, signale
un point très important de la cause, les dèclarations du prisonnier quant à ses
agissements le jour du meurtre, où un témoin lui prête des paroles différentes
selon qu'il rapporte ses paroles en anglais ou en français, ce qui semble
indiquer que le témoin ne se rendait pas bien compte du sens de ses expressions
quand il parlait une autre langue que la sienne.

Cependant en décidant s'il y a lieu d'ordonner un
nouveau procès, nous sommes liés par la disposition formelle de l'article 1019 . On Code Criminel. Il ne suffit pas, en
effet, aux termes de cet article,

qu'il ait été fait quelque chose de non
conforme à la loi pendant le procès,

il faut encore que

de l'avis de la cour d'appel, il en soit
résulté quelque tort réel ou un déni de justice.

Je suis bien d'avis qu'il a été fait quelque chose
de

[Page 432]

non conforme à la loi pendant le procès,
c'est-à-dire que l'accusé avait droit à ce que le procès fût instruit dans les
deux langues, et à ce que l'adresse du juge au jury fût faite ou traduite, au
moins dans ses parties essentielles, dans les deux langues, mais puisque le
Code Criminel  exige en outre que je sois d'opinion qu'il en est résulté un tort
réel ou un déni de justice, je ne puis, dans toutes les circonstances de cette
cause, aller jusque là.

Je dois donc, et non sans regret, concourir dans la
décision de la cour d'appel sur cette première question.

Quatrième Question,

Was there error of law occasioning
substantial wrong or miscarriage in that the judge who presided commented upon
the failure of the prisoner to testify to the effect that he had not actually
committed the murders mentioned in the indictment?

Je répondrai négativement à cette question, car
puisque le prisonnier a volontairement donné son témoignage, le juge pouvait
faire des commentaires sur ce qu'il avait dit ou omis de dire J'adhère
pleinement à ce que mon honorable collègue, M. le juge Anglin, dit de ces commentaires.
Qu'ils aient été excessifs, je suis très respectueusement porté à le croire,
mais il n'y a pas là erreur de droit. Sur ce point donc je partage l'opinion de
la majorité de la cour d'appel.

Je suis d'opinion de renvoyer l'appel.

Appeal dismissed.

2413898,Georges v Tribastoni [2011] NSWDC 36,"REASONS FOR Judgment 
1In May 2009 the plaintiff completed the purchase of a Ferrari from the second defendant. A few months later he engaged the third defendant to find a buyer and left the Ferrari with him for that purpose. The Ferrari was not returned to the plaintiff, and on 13 August 2009 it was sold to Supercar Classics Pty Ltd trading as Haberfield Classic & Sports Cars. The proceeds of that sale have not been accounted for to the plaintiff. 
2Following completion of the purchase of the Ferrari, the plaintiff failed to effect a transfer of the registration of the Ferrari into his name, and it remained registered in the name of the second defendant until it was transferred into the name of Haberfield Classic & Sports Cars after the sale to that company. The first defendant was the owner and a director of the second defendant corporation. The first defendant caused the second defendant to prepare various documents that facilitated the sale and transfer of the registration to Haberfield Classic & Sports Cars. 

The issues 
3The plaintiff sues the third defendant in conversion and detinue, alleging that he sold the Ferrari without authority, and has failed to return the Ferrari to the plaintiff. The third defendant opposes the claim, alleging that the Ferrari was not in his possession when it was sold to Haberfield Classic & Sports Cars. He asserts that the plaintiff in fact delivered the Ferrari to another man, Mr Omar Tleis, and that it was Mr Tleis who effected the sale of the Ferrari to Haberfield Classic & Sports Cars. Further, he asserts that it was Mr Tleis who received the proceeds of the sale of the Ferrari, and that it was Mr Tleis who has not accounted to the plaintiff for those proceeds. 
4The proceedings against the second defendant were not pursued because that company has gone into liquidation. 
5The plaintiff also sues the first defendant, in conversion, alleging that he prepared the various documents that facilitated the sale and transfer of the registration to Haberfield Classic & Sports Cars without the plaintiff's authority. The first defendant opposes the claim, alleging that the plaintiff expressly authorised him to arrange for the preparation and issue of that documentation. 

Background 
6The plaintiff, Mr Georges, is a young man with an interest in cars, especially luxury and sports cars. On 20 March 2009 he entered into a written Contract of Sale with the first defendant, Mr Fabio Tribastoni, whereby he purchased a yellow Ferrari 360 Spyder 2003 motor vehicle. The purchase price of $218,000 was made up of a trade-in of $60,000, the balance of $158,000 to be paid by monthly instalments by 31 July 2009. It was a term of the agreement that Mr Tribastoni would hold the original registration papers and one spare key until payment in full had been received. 
7Mr Tribastoni had himself purchased the Ferrari only two days earlier. The Ferrari was located for Mr Tribastoni by an associate, Mr Tony Haddad, the third defendant. At that time Mr Tribastoni was in the process of establishing a car dealership, to be operated through a company structure, namely the second defendant, Meridian Investment Group Pty Ltd trading as National Car Wholesalers. The shareholders of that company were Mr Tribastoni and his wife. At the time of purchasing the Ferrari, the necessary dealer's licence had not been obtained and Mr Tribastoni arranged for registration of the Ferrari to be transferred into the name of a friend who did have a dealer's licence, a Mr Safit Aydin, trading as Homebush Used Cars. That transfer was effected on 18 March 2009. It was only after National Car Wholesalers began trading on 1 May 2009 that registration of the Ferrari was transferred into its name on 20 May 2009. 
8In the meantime Mr Georges took delivery of the Ferrari from Mr Tribastoni on 20 March 2009, together with one set of keys, and he began to use the car. 

9Thereafter Mr Georges paid off the balance of the purchase price by instalments, and completed the purchase upon payment of the final payment on 7 July 2009, when Mr Tribastoni gave Mr Georges the spare set of keys, a keypad and log books. Mr Tribastoni also caused National Car Wholesalers as the registered owner to issue documentation to enable registration of the Ferrari to be transferred to Mr Georges (Exhibit J). That documentation consisted of a Tax Invoice (No 86) and a Notice of Sale. For reasons that were never satisfactorily explained, these documents specified the sale price as $197,000. 

10Mr Georges, however, did not effect a transfer of the registration of the Ferrari into his name, and chose to leave it registered in the name of National Car Wholesalers. Why Mr Georges failed to transfer the Ferrari into his name was one of the contentious issues in this case. As will emerge, it was the plaintiff's failure to transfer the registration into his name that enabled the Ferrari to be on-sold without his express authorisation. He said he did not transfer the Ferrari into his name because he was unable at that time to afford the stamp duty required, but that he always intended to do so when he had enough money, and prior to selling the Ferrari. He never did pay the stamp duty, principally because of the subsequent events the subject of these proceedings. 
11Shortly after completing the purchase of the Ferrari, Mr Georges got into financial difficulties, as a result of which he decided to sell the Ferrari quickly. He initially thought to make a profit on the sale. That expectation proved to be something of a pipe dream. 
12In early October 2009 he engaged the third defendant, Mr Haddad, an ""independent car locater"", to find a buyer for the Ferrari. In subsequent weeks he left the Ferrari with Mr Haddad on several occasions, together with a set of keys and a keypad, for the purpose of enabling Mr Haddad to show the Ferrari to prospective customers. During October Mr Haddad attempted to find a buyer for the Ferrari. He told Mr Georges about a number of interested prospective purchasers, but nothing eventuated. 
13Another contentious issue in the case was the basis of the arrangement between Mr Georges and Mr Haddad. It is Mr Georges' case that he only ever authorised Mr Haddad to find a buyer, and gave him an indicative price range, but not to sell the Ferrari without first referring back to him on the price. 
14Mr Haddad, on the other hand, contended that Mr Georges gave him full authority to sell the Ferrari, at a certain price, initially $195,000, and later, $190,000. 
15It is Mr Georges' case that the last time he saw his Ferrari was when he delivered it to Mr Haddad on Monday 12 October 2009 at the premises of Sydney Motors, at Bankstown. He remembered the day because he had collected the Ferrari the previous weekend for a photo shoot at a wedding. 
16Importantly, Mr Georges kept one set of keys and keypad, the log books, and the paperwork proving his ownership of the Ferrari. It was his belief that the Ferrari could not be sold whilst he retained possession of those items. 
17The next day, Tuesday 13 October 2009, the Ferrari was purchased by another motor dealer, Supercar Classics Pty Ltd trading as Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars. That company has since gone into liquidation, but the proprietor, Mr Nick Papalexandris, gave evidence about the purchase, to which I will come in a moment. It is Mr Georges' case that he knew nothing about this sale, which he says was effected without his knowledge and without his authority. 
18According to the evidence of Mr Papalexandris, a person by the name of Omar rang him prior to 13 October 2009 and asked whether he wanted to buy a Ferrari. Mr Papalexandris asked Omar to bring the Ferrari for him to have a look at it. Subsequently Omar brought the Ferrari to show Mr Papalexandris, when it was agreed that Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars would purchase the Ferrari for $180,000, to be paid in cash. He told Omar to come back in approximately 3 days while he obtained the cash. 
19Mr Papalexandris believed that Omar was acting for or on behalf of the second defendant, National Car Wholesalers. It was his understanding that Mr Haddad and Omar both worked for Mr Tribastoni in his business, National Car Wholesalers. Mr Papalexandris believed the seller was National Car Wholesalers and was never told that the car in fact belonged to Mr Georges. 
20On 13 October 2009 Omar attended at Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars to deliver the car and collect the cash from Mr Papalexandris, who asked for an invoice. Omar made a phone call, following which an invoice was faxed by National Car Wholesalers to Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars. But Mr Papalexandris was not happy with the invoice and insisted that it state that the purchase price had been paid in full. He rang Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars and spoke to Mr Tribastoni, and asked for an invoice that showed the purchase price had been paid. Soon after a second invoice was faxed from National Car Wholesalers to Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars with the word ""Paid"" written on it and initialled by Mr Tribastoni (Exhibit O - Document 5). 
21Mr Papalexandris took delivery of the Ferrari and gave $180,000 in cash to Omar. 
22It is not disputed by Mr Tribastoni that he caused Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars to issue the invoice to Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars with the word ""Paid"" written on it. It is his case, however, that he only did so to ""book the Ferrari out from the company records"" at the request of Mr Haddad and with the express authority of Mr Georges. I will return to this in due course. 
23Mr Georges' evidence was that he attempted to contact Mr Haddad every day in the week following his delivery of the Ferrari to him on 12 October 2009, but that on each occasion he spoke to him, Mr Haddad gave excuses about the delay in finding a buyer. It seems clear from those conversations and text messages received on his mobile phone from Mr Haddad's phone that Mr Georges remained oblivious of the events on 13 October 2009 pursuant to which the Ferrari was purchased by Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars. 
24In one conversation Mr Haddad told him: 

Haddad: ""I've got a buyer. He'll pay $190,000.00 but I've got to pay these guys (meaning Sydney Motors) $2,000.00 for the use of the yard. The buyer has traded his boat in for $20,000.00. I'm waiting for the cheque to clear. He's coming up with the rest of the money by mid week and the end of the week."" 

Georges: ""Ok."" 

Haddad: ""I'm going to need the other keys and the receipt Fabio gave you."" 

Georges: ""Ok, but once you've come up with the whole amount, I'll give them to you at the same time. I won't give you the keys, the books or receipt until you bring the money. You make a time and place when we can do the exchange and complete the deal."" 

Haddad: ""I'll let you know, Wednesday or Thursday."" 

25On Wednesday 14 October Mr Georges received a text message from Mr Haddad to the following effect (Exhibit L): 

""The bloke rang tomor after non hell have all the cash."" (sic) 

26On Friday 16 October Mr Georges received a text message from Mr Haddad to the following effect (Exhibit L): 

""Bud im in melbouren ill try let oma organise it. Give me a hour."" (sic) 

27The evidence that emerged at trial, in particular the telephone records, was that Mr Haddad was not in Melbourne on 16 October 2009. 

28Mr Georges said he subsequently had two telephone conversations with Omar and asked for his Ferrari, but was told it was in storage for the weekend and he was unable to get hold of the guy who owned the garage. He did not tell Mr Georges the Ferrari had in fact already been sold. 
29On Saturday 17 October 2009 Mr Georges sent Mr Haddad a text message to the following effect: 

""Tony I want my car back. It's a sunny weekend."" 

30Paragraph 34 of Mr Georges' affidavit of 26 July 2010 was partially struck out, initially, but counsel for the first defendant cross-examined Mr Georges about the paragraph. It records two phone conversations he said he had with Omar on Sunday 19 October 2009: 

Georges: ""Omar, where is my car?"" 

Omar: ""I'm going to do the deal now. I'm leaving in 10 minutes."" 

And later the same day: 

Omar: ""I've sold the car, I've got $168,000.00. I need the original papers and keys."" 

Georges: ""Why about the other $20,000.00? (sic) When do I get my money? The deals not on until I get my money."" 

Omar: ""No, Tony told me just pick up the money and not to give it to you. I can't get on to Tony myself."" 

Georges: ""Why, this is my money. You've sold the car without my authority and you don't want to give me my money back."" 

31The next day, Monday 20 October 2009 Mr Georges went to back to the premises of Sydney Motors, at Bankstown, the car dealership where he had left his Ferrari with Mr Haddad on 12 October 2009, and had a conversation with the principal, Mr Estephan. Mr Georges' Ferrari was not there. About an hour later, however, he received a phone call from Omar, who said: ""I'm sick of all this, the other owner is on my back about getting the original forms and you're on my back about getting your money. Meet me at 7pm at my house tonight to get your money. 14 Cardigan Road, Greenacre is my mother's home."" 
32Mr Georges did not agree to go to 14 Cardigan Road, Greenacre that night. Instead, he arranged to meet Omar at the NAB branch at Riverwood the next morning. This was another contentious issue in these proceedings. Mr Georges told the court that he did not arrange to meet Omar at the bank; rather he arranged to meet Omar at the bus stop outside the bank. This evidence was directly contradicted by his sister, Ms Carol Saad, who also gave evidence in the proceedings. Just why Mr Georges prevaricated on this episode is not entirely clear. 
33At any event, Omar did not turn up to the proposed meeting at the bank on Tuesday 21 October 2009, so Mr Georges and his sister went to Omar's mother's house at 14 Cardigan Road, Greenacre where they were met by Omar and another unidentified man. During the course of that encounter, Mr Georges was told that the house and been robbed the night before and the proceeds from the sale of the Ferrari had been stolen. 
34Mr Georges and his sister left and drove to the RTA branch at Rockdale, where he unsuccessfully attempted to transfer the registration of the Ferrari into his name. He was told by an RTA officer that the Ferrari was now registered in another business name and the plates had been changed. 
35It finally dawned on Mr Georges that he had been swindled, and he went to the police. 
36Mr Georges has not seen the Ferrari since, nor has he received one cent of the $180,000 for which it was sold. 

The plaintiff's case 
37The essence of Mr Georges' case against Mr Haddad is that he put the Ferrari into his possession as bailee, solely to permit him to show it to prospective purchasers. Mr Haddad converted the Ferrari by selling it without the authority of Mr Georges, thus depriving him of his immediate right to possession. Alternatively, Mr Georges demanded the return of the Ferrari, but Mr Haddad wrongfully and unequivocally failed to comply with that demand. 
38As against Mr Tribastoni, Mr Georges alleges that he acted in a manner repugnant to Mr Georges' ownership of the Ferrari by causing National Car Wholesalers as the registered owner to issue documentation that enabled its disposal to Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars, without authority. In so doing, Mr Tribastoni was also guilty of conversion. 

The third defendant's case 
39Mr Haddad's case, in essence, is that the Ferrari was not in his possession when it was sold to Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars, and that he had nothing at all to do with that sale. He says that Mr Georges entered into a separate and discrete arrangement with Omar, and that Omar was in possession of the Ferrari. It was Omar who sold the car to Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars, and he did so with Mr Georges' authority, for cash. It is Omar who has failed to account to Mr Georges for the proceeds of the sale. 
40Although Omar was not called as a witness to confirm this version of events, Mr Haddad did call Mr Estephan, the owner of Sydney Motors, as a witness in an attempt to prove that Mr Georges delivered the car into Omar's possession. 
41According to Mr Haddad, Mr Georges was regularly dropping the Ferrari off at Sydney Motors for him and other car dealers to try and sell. The evidence of Mr Estephan was to the effect that he had seen Mr Georges deliver the Ferrari to both Mr Haddad and Omar on various occasions. 
42According to Mr Haddad's evidence he received a phone call from Mr Georges one day when Mr Haddad was not in Sydney in which he was told by Mr Georges that he had sold the Ferrari through Omar. Mr Georges went on to ask Mr Haddad to contact Mr Tribastoni because the Ferrari was still registered in his name. The conversation continued as follows: 

Haddad: ""I am not on good terms with Mr Tribastoni now however I will give him a call, but why the car is still in his name?"" (sic) 

Georges: ""The transfer was going to cost over $7,000 and I couldn't do it."" 

Haddad: ""I prefer if I am present on the sale."" 

Georges: ""I can't wait."" 

43Haddad said that some time after that phone call he rang Mr Tribastoni and had the following conversation: 

Haddad: ""I was told by Symond that Omar has sold the car and he wants you to book it out to the new buyer. 

Tribastoni: ""I have to call Symond to confirm."" 

44But Mr Tribastoni never rang Mr Georges to confirm. Nor was it was explained why Mr Georges didn't ring Mr Tribastoni himself, or get Omar to ring him. The evidence established that Omar and Mr Tribastoni were well acquainted with each other, as was Mr Haddad, who was a close associate of Mr Tribastoni and Omar, who was in fact his first cousin. 
45It is not disputed that Mr Haddad did in fact ring Mr Tribastoni and ask him to book the Ferrari out, that is, to prepare an invoice. Mr Tribastoni's evidence was that the call occurred on or about 10 October 2009, when they said words to the following effect: 

Haddad: ""I have been speaking with Symond Georges and he told me to call you about the invoice. I've sold Symond Georges' car to Haberfield Classics, can you please produce the invoice."" 

Tribastoni: ""Ok."" 

46Mr Haddad denied saying to Mr Tribastoni that he had sold the Ferrari. It is his case that he only rang Mr Tribastoni as a favour for Mr Georges, and that Omar sold the Ferrari, acting on his own, on direct authority from Mr Georges, not on behalf of Mr Haddad, 

The first defendant's case 
47Mr Tribastoni's case is very simple: he created and sent the invoice to Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars at the express request of Mr Georges. In his affidavit of 27 October 2010 Mr Tribastoni said: 

""On or about 1 October 2009 Mr Symond Georges attended the company warehouse at 21 Hotham Parade Artarmon NSW and there was a conversation with words to the effect: 

Georges: ""I can't afford to keep the car I am in financial trouble. I have to sell the car. The car is still in your company name, I don't want to pay stamp duty, I have not transferred the car to my name. Can you please provide an invoice for the car to whoever buys it once the car sells."" 

Tribastoni: ""Ok."" 

48Whether Mr Georges knew the Ferrari was in the company name rather than in the name of Mr Tribastoni, with whom he made the Contract of Sale, was not explored. 
49Mr Tribastoni was challenged about this alleged conversation in cross-examination. He said it occurred about mid morning on a weekday after he saw Mr Georges arrive, and he went out and spoke to him on the footpath, at his car. 
50He considered that conversation was sufficient authority for him to book the Ferrari out for $180,000, without referring back to Mr Georges for confirmation. He simply relied upon the say so of Mr Haddad and Mr Papalexandris that Mr Georges had sold the Ferrari, for cash, for $180,000. He made one enquiry: he asked Mr Papalexandris, ""Why so much cash?"" Mr Papalexandris replied, ""That's what was organised between Tony and Symond."" 
51Mr Tribastoni was asked in cross-examination, ""Did you think to ring Mr Georges?"" and he said, ""Yes. And I tried to ring him a couple of times and there was no answer. I rang his mobile but he did not answer."" 
52I was not referred to any telephone records to support this evidence. 
53In written submissions, it was submitted for Mr Tribastoni that the court should find that the invoice of 13 October 2009 was produced on the instruction, and thereby the authority, of Mr Georges. On this basis, Mr Georges' case must fail in conversion because Mr Tribastoni acted in a manner consistent with the wishes of Mr George. Mr Tribastoni did not have the Ferrari in his possession, and the invoice of itself did not cause the title to the Ferrari to be transferred. Preparation of the invoice on instructions from Mr Georges was not an act to deprive the true owner of his immediate right to possession. He did not deny Mr Georges' title to the Ferrari. The only way the Ferrari could have been transferred was the production of the invoice to give effect to the transfer of registration. That was done on instruction. 
Credit 
54It is abundantly clear that the court was not given the whole story about the events surrounding the sale of Mr Georges' Ferrari. Nor was the evidence I did receive particularly reliable. The credibility of all the witnesses was suspect, apart from Ms Saad. 
55Mr Georges' credibility was damaged by several unsatisfactory aspects of his evidence. He prevaricated about the arrangement to meet Omar at the NAB branch at Riverwood on Tuesday 21 October 2009. He did not agree to meet at the bus stop, but clearly intended to meet at the bank itself, presumably because Omar had told him he would bring the money. But that was a peripheral episode and does not, in my view, prove that Omar had been authorised to sell the Ferrari. Mr Georges demonstrated an ability for dishonesty by not paying the stamp duty on the purchase of his Ferrari, and his evidence about the insurance he effected for the Ferrari was also unsatisfactory. However, in this case, as will be seen, the assessment of credit became a matter of comparable relativity. Overall, in my assessment, Mr Georges gave a consistent and essentially reliable account on the critical matters, and was the most reliable of the witnesses. Without question, his evidence is to be preferred to that of Mr Haddad and Mr Tribastoni. 
56Mr Tribastoni was shown to have acted dishonestly in a number of respects. There were at least 10 instances in respect of which I granted him a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995 providing him with privilege in respect of self-incriminating evidence. The Tax Invoice (No 86) and Notice of Sale of 7 July 2009 misrepresented the true purchase price paid by Mr Georges for the Ferrari. Mr Tribastoni was willing to keep the Ferrari registered in his company's name, and had no quibbles about assisting in its transfer to Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars, avoiding the stamp duty payable in respect of the purchase from him by Mr Georges. And he was less than candid about his relationship with Mr Haddad and Omar before the full extent and duration of his connection to those two men emerged when he was cross- examined by Mr Haddad (see Exhibit 2). 

57In the result, I approached the veracity of the evidence of Mr Tribastoni sceptically, with caution and suspicion. Thus, where I was unable to resolve conflicts in the evidence by reference to the objective material or by an assessment of the inherent logic or probability of events, I preferred the evidence of Mr Georges to that of Mr Tribastoni. 
58Mr Haddad's evidence was completely unreliable. As counsel for Mr Tribastoni wrote in his submissions: 

""The third defendant is 34 years of age and has never filed a tax return, never paid income tax and does not know how to do so. The witness was evasive in cross-examination in respect to his income. The Third Defendant has his home listed for sale at $1,000,000."" [23] 

""The witness gave evidence that he went to jail for a matter relating to perjury. The witness also gave evidence that he assisted various organs of government in the prosecution of various persons and that his wife and children received $105,000 from these agencies."" 

59Mr Haddad was ""caught out"" in a series of untruths during the course of the trial. His evidence about the telephone provided to him by Mr Tribastoni and when he used it or didn't use it was less than candid, and the various text messages he sent were factitious and misleading. For example, he told Mr Georges he was in Melbourne when he wasn't. The fact that Omar was his cousin only emerged in cross-examination, and even then he attempted to minimise the closeness of their relationship. Overall I formed the view that Mr Haddad is thoroughly untrustworthy and his evidence lacked any sense of integrity or veracity. 
60In my view the evidence of Mr Haddad is not to be believed. Absent any compelling corroborative material, I have declined to accept any of the evidence given by Mr Haddad. 

Findings and conclusions 
61I am comfortably satisfied that Mr Georges last saw his Ferrari when he delivered it into the possession of Mr Haddad on 12 October 2009. I find further that Mr Georges put the Ferrari into the possession of Mr Haddad on that day for the limited purpose of showing it to prospective buyers, and that he did not give Mr Haddad authority to sell the Ferrari without first referring back to Mr Georges on price. 
62The proposition that Mr Georges delivered the Ferrari to Omar and gave him authority to sell it, for cash, never rose above the status of a suggestion. The proposition was an invention designed to avoid complicity in the scam pursuant to which the Ferrari was swindled away from Mr Georges. 
63I am comfortably satisfied that to the extent Omar played a role in the sale of the Ferrari, he did so not at the behest of Mr Georges, but on the instructions of Mr Haddad, as his agent or associate (see for example the text message sent on 16 October 2009 in Exhibit L). 
64I am also comfortably satisfied that Mr Georges demanded the return of his Ferrari by Mr Haddad, who has wrongfully refused to do so. 
65For these reasons I find that Mr Haddad wrongfully converted Mr Georges' Ferrari and is also liable to him in detinue. 
66Turning to Mr Tribastoni, I am comfortably satisfied that Mr Georges never authorised Mr Tribastoni to prepare the invoice on 13 October 2009 by which the Ferrari was booked out to Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars. I find that the conversation Mr Tribastoni alleges occurred outside his warehouse at 21 Hotham Parade Artarmon on or about 1 October 2009 never occurred. Nor did Mr Tribastoni attempt to ring Mr Georges to check whether he had agreed to the sale of the Ferrari on 13 October 2009, or at any time. I find that Mr Tribastoni booked the car out on the say so of Mr Haddad and Mr Papalexandris, and in so doing he consciously and deliberately acted in a manner repugnant to Mr Georges' ownership of the Ferrari. 

67By enabling the disposal of the Ferrari to Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars without the owner's authority Mr Tribastoni was guilty of conversion. 
68The plaintiff succeeds against both the first defendant and the third defendant and I enter verdicts in his favour against each of them. 

Damages 
69Mr Georges' case on damages is that the value of the Ferrari as at the date of the conversion was the amount for which it was sold to Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars, namely $180,000.00. 

70It was submitted for the defendants that the value of the Ferrari was in fact only $165,000.00, being the amount for which Haberfield Classic and Sports Cars on-sold the Ferrari several days later, the lesser amount being attributable to transmission problems. 

71The only evidence of transmission problems came from Mr Papalexandris. It was never pleaded, nor did anyone else say there were transmission problems. I reject that evidence on the basis that is unreliable and not independently supported by any other evidence. 

72For these reasons I find that the value of the Ferrari at the relevant date, 13 October 2009, was $180,000.00 and that the plaintiff is entitled to damages in that amount together with interest at the prescribed statutory rates from that date to the date of judgment. 

Interest 
73Interest is awarded on the damages at the statutory rate as follows: 13 October 2009 - 30 June 2010 (260 days @ 9% pa) = $11,539.72 1 July 2010 - 25 February 2011 (240 days @ 8.75% pa = $10,356.16 Total interest $21,895.88 
74The damages and interest total $201,895.88. 

Costs 
75Costs follow the event and are payable on the ordinary basis, unless some other order is appropriate. There is nothing before me, at this point, to indicate that some other order is appropriate. 

76There should be an order for costs in favour of the plaintiff against the first defendant and the third defendant. 

Disposition 
77I direct the entry of judgment for the plaintiff against the first defendant in the amount of $201,895.88. 

78I direct the entry of judgment for the plaintiff against the third defendant in the amount of $201,895.88. 

79The proceedings against the second defendant are dismissed, with no order as to costs. 

80I order the first defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs, on the ordinary basis. 

81I order the third defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs, on the ordinary basis. 

Note: The Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 provide (Rule 36.11) that unless the Court otherwise orders, a judgment or order is taken to be entered when it is recorded in the Court's computerised court record system. Setting aside and variation of judgments or orders is dealt with by Rules 36.15, 36.16, 36.17 and 36.18. Parties should in particular note the time limit of fourteen days in Rule 36.16.

		14 June 2011",2011-02-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2413970,R v M.M.E.B [2011] NSWDC 207,"Judgment  1One of the responsible laden tasks each of us does daily is the driving of our motor vehicles. The State takes great pains to ensure that only those imbued with a sense of responsibility and equipped with the appropriate skills are permitted to drive upon the road. Part of the fabric of measures the State puts in place to ensure responsible driving is a series of prohibitions that drivers must obey. One of those prohibitions is that drivers are forbidden to drive under the influence of a drug.  2MMEB chose to do just this, that is to say he chose to drive whilst he was under the influence of a drug on 14 April 2007. Whilst driving in such a condition his vehicle impacted with another. The consequence of that impact was the death of a law-abiding third party and very serious injury to his own son.  3When arraigned upon charges relating to this episode, namely that he drove under the influence of a drug or alternatively, that he drove in a manner dangerous to another person he told those who were ultimately to become his jury that he was not guilty of either. A trial commenced on 19 July 2010. It lasted for some ten days. His defences to the principle charges were that he had or held an honest and reasonable belief that when he took the relevant drug, a prescription slimming tablet, Phentermine, that they were not prescription drugs and that they did nothing to make him unfit to drive. By his pleas he also put in issue the question of whether he was driving in a manner dangerous to another person.  4The jury by its verdict rejected beyond reasonable doubt the defence advanced and accepted the Crown case as being made out in respect of the principal charges. They were not required to consider the drive in a manner dangerous to another person's charges. That does not mean the question of his manner of driving is irrelevant to any proper assessment of his criminality.  5As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for these two offences before this Court committed by this offender harming these victims in this community. The Queen v Gladue [1999] 1SCR 688 [80].  6My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender called subjective matters. The starting point for these assessments requires me to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and the offender. My fact-finding task in respect of the offence necessarily requires me to find facts consistent with and reflective of the jury's verdict. There is no obligation to find facts at either extreme of favourability or unfavourability to the accused.  7It is clear the jury verdicts rejected the defence advanced by the offender. But that still leaves a substantial number of facts to be determined, as I say in accordance with and in sympathy with the verdicts that they gave.  8An unusual feature of this case is the delay between offending and sentence. Whether that delay causes an impact will need some assessment. The offender's rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly. The proper sentencing disposition and if it be a sentence of imprisonment, the appropriate sentences and parole periods need to be determined.  9What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against an imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined. See R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740 and R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329.  Facts  10The time was about 7.40pm on the second Saturday night in April. The offender was driving his Subaru Impreza WRX sedan easterly on Hoxton Park Road approaching the Whitford Road intersection. Elisapeta Faimata was driving her Proton Wira westerly towards the same intersection. In the offender's car was his wife in the passenger seat, his son then aged four and daughter aged seven, seated in the rear. The signed speed limit was sixty kilometres per hour. The road was of sealed bitumen. 105 metres before the intersection the road, as the offender was travelling, it became two lanes for him. The extra left land ended 140 metres east of the intersection. In total that left lane is 270.5 metres. The collision occurred approximately eighty-five metres east of the intersection, that is about thirty-five metres after the Hoxton Park Road reverted to a single lane going in each direction.  11The roadway was generally flat and curved slightly to the offender's right. The impact occurred at night time by which I mean in the dark or in darkness although the road was well lit; the road was dry. Facing east bound traffic were two signs, both of them past the intersection, the first stating ""Left Lane Ends Merge Right"" and the second ""Form 1 Lane"". The offender's evidence was he could not read these signs. That makes sense because he has no literacy in English and is barely literate in his native tongue of Arabic.  12The intersection was controlled by traffic lights. As he approached the intersection the traffic lights facing him were showing red. Already parked at these lights were two or perhaps three cars waiting for the lights to turn green. There was no traffic waiting in the left hand lane. As he approached the stationary vehicles in the right hand lane the lights changed to green. The Corolla lead car entered the intersection followed by the other car or cars behind it. When the light changed green the offender accelerated in an attempt to underpass all of these vehicles in the 140 metres left to him as he exited the intersection. It may be that he had a little longer than 140 metres because I am satisfied the light turned green before he hit the intersection.  13He reached a speed of no less than eighty kilometres an hour as the road narrowed on the far side of the intersection to a single lane. He ran out of bitumen laneway. His vehicle travelled at this speed on the gravel shoulder. The offender still determined to complete the underpass of the remaining vehicle or vehicles to his right. Having done that he re-entered the bitumen, the back end of his vehicle went left, he crossed onto the incorrect side of the road. The front right hand side of his vehicle impacted with the front right hand side of the Proton. Upon impact the vehicles were airborne, obviously came back down and rotated clockwise accounting for some of the tyre marks on the road. There is no evidence from which I could conclude the offender ever applied his brakes at the impact scene and its approaches. The Subaru appears to have rotated almost two and a half times.  14Two of the drivers heading in the same direction as the offender gave evidence and a passenger in the lead car also gave evidence. Their evidence is based upon their experience at the scene and is worth repeating as a non-scientific, but nonetheless accurate account of what they saw.  15Crystal Trantas's evidence is that she had been stopped at the red light. She was travelling through the intersection of Hoxton Park Road and Whitford Road when she heard a loud engine that sounded like it was progressing because it got a lot louder so she slowed down. When she first heard it the noise was coming from behind her. She doesn't recall whether she took her foot off the accelerator or braked but either one of those would have resulted in her slowing down. She saw a car ""fly up her left hand side"" after she passed the intersection. As there was no more merging lane, the vehicle had to go onto the gravel and maybe after a couple of car lengths the car had to get in front of her. It swerved to get in front of her and lost control. At no time prior to that happening did she accelerate.  16The back end of the vehicle went left and as the car tried to straighten up it went head on with another vehicle coming in the opposite direction. She did not see the oncoming car. She did see the WRX get airborne after having hit the other car.  17In Ms Trantas's vehicle was her sister Joanna Pickett. That lady's evidence was that they came to a set of lights at the corner of Hoxton Park and Whitford Roads, which were initially red so they stopped. She described the lane structure in the intersection then her evidence was that their vehicle was in the lane closer to the middle of the road, the lights turned green and they slowly started through the intersection. They got right through the intersection to the other side and then she heard a rumbling of a big engine coming from the left hand side behind. She could hear it but could not see it initially. Before she knew it ""the car was on the [left] hand side of us going past"" and then she saw the car come past and it went from the bitumen where the lane had ended onto the gravel. It had passed them on the inside and was on the gravel in front of them.  18The Subaru appeared as though it tried to get back onto the road and when he got back onto the bitumen the back of the car swung out clockwise. Then the car went onto the other side of the road into oncoming traffic. There was a collision with a car coming the other way.  19A third person, the driver of the second vehicle, a Nissan Patrol, gave an account not dissimilar. She said she started into first and moved into second gear. While she was in second gear she noticed a white WRX Subaru flashing past at eighty plus. She saw the Subaru trying to get into the right hand lane from the left which had already ended. Next she noted a dispersing of cars in front of her but she never saw the impact.  20Tendered in the Crown case was exhibit B, an account given by the accused, through his legal representatives, to investigating police on 14 May 2007. It is in these terms:  ""The 14 April 2007 was the worst day of my life. Around 7.40pm I was driving down Hoxton Park Road with my wife and two children, a boy and a girl aged four and seven respectively, from my home at Rossmore, to visit a very sick friend who had recently had an operation. While driving down Hoxton Park Road, around the suburb of Hinchinbrook, I approached a set of traffic lights. I could see from a distance that the traffic lights were red in colour. There were several cars stationary in lane two and waiting for the traffic lights to turn green. As I approached the traffic lights, the lights turned green. There were no cars in lane one. Accordingly, I moved to lane one to avoid stopping behind the cars that had been stationary in lane two.  It turned out that lane one was a short one, which ended a short distance after the traffic lights. Once I realised that lane one was to end, I attempted to negotiate into lane two. As I attempted this, the car inside me accelerated to cut off any opportunity I had to merge into lane two. By this time lane one had ended and I was now travelling on some gravel. When I eventually proceeded to merge onto lane two, my car lost traction on the gravel and I ended up on the wrong side of the road, where the fatal accident occurred.  A woman died and my family sustained injuries. My son, in particular, was in a critical condition after the collision, which required him to stay in hospital for three weeks. My daughter was admitted for approximately one week and my wife for two days.""  There is more to the statement, but the ""more"" is about topics other than the facts of the offence.  21It is clear the jury rejected the accused's account as given to investigating police on 14 May 2007. Neither the Corolla, nor any other, car accelerated with a view to excluding him from merging. He had sought to, and succeeded in passing all of the vehicles, to a point where none of the trailing vehicles record any suggestion of being in peril once the accused's vehicle had impacted with the Proton.  22Defence counsel argued that although the jury rejected the defence of an honest and reasonable mistake, I should find that the basis of the rejection by the jury was based upon the proposition that an honest mistake was made by him in the consumption of the tablets of Phentermine, not knowing they were a drug, but that the jury took a view the mistake was not a reasonable one.  23The evidence of Dr Pearl had been that the blood concentration of Phentermine found in the accused was 0.25 milligrams per litre. It was her opinion that this was well above, nearly three times above, the therapeutic concentration, which was 0.09 milligrams per litre. It was her opinion that the offender had consumed more Phentermine than the single daily morning dose prescribed for the wife, whose Phentermine it was- a dose which she had been given for the purposes of losing weight. The therapeutic dose was geared to controlling appetite for a twenty-four hour period.  24The offender's case was that he had taken a single dose somewhere between ten and eleven that morning. There is evidence that what is called the half life of Phentermine or sometimes known as Duromine - I think that is the brand name - is twelve to sixteen hours. This offence occurs, accepting that the offender had taken his dose at 11 o'clock, some sixteen and a half hours after he had taken the pill. The testing had occurred probably within an hour or two of that, bringing it up to about eighteen hours, and even so it was at 0.25 milligrams.  25The cross-examiner sought to have Dr Pearl accept the high dosage occurred as a result of build up of the drug. On the defence case, he had only been taking the drug for seven days. It is likely and I find that the jury did not regard this cross-examination as persuasive, but preferred the original reasoning given by Dr Pearl. Indeed, the jury may well have been fortified in its own view when it realised the offender's weight at the time of consuming the pills was something in the order of ninety-two kilograms. Given his height and build, the jury would be right to have questioned his reasons for consuming the pills.  26The directions I gave to the jury left open for them to consider whether the accused consumed more Phentermine than a single morning dose. It was also left open for them to consider whether the offender had consumed pills for some purpose other than weight loss. I should in passing note that one of the effects of the pills is said to be that of an amphetamine.  27I am satisfied the offender's consumption of the pills was not for weight loss. I am also satisfied that on 14 April he consumed at least two pills, that being the day of impact. I am satisfied his consumption of the drug was related to its control nervous stimulant effect. I am satisfied he well knew that taking a second tablet was contrary to the recommended and/or prescribed dosage. His mistake on this basis, if mistake was made, was neither honest nor reasonable. I note he told Dr Westmore that after taking the Duromine he felt energetic. Dr Westmore noted that the offender was not significantly overweight at the time and the effects of the drug may have therefore been enhanced. When asked by Dr Westmore did he become more aggressive, angry or irritable, the offender said, ""Yes, a little bit"".  28It was the defence case that there was no warning against driving on the packet. Evidence was called from the prescribing pharmacist. She made plain that her practice was to regard such warnings as compulsory when this particular drug was prescribed. It was clear she regarded any failure to affix a warning label as professionally negligent and, I suspect, unethical. I am satisfied she was conscientious in the utmost in respect of her compliance to affix a warning label when one was required. In those circumstances, I am satisfied beyond doubt that such a warning label was affixed.  29This offender says he cannot read English. There is ample evidence to support him on that. He said he could not read the road signs having English words on them, although he recognised what some of them were about. His wife had bought the slimming tablets. I have assumed she knew about the warning label and its meaning. The defence case was she dispensed a single tablet to him daily. In those circumstances the defence was that the Crown could not prove that the warning had been passed on from the wife. By its verdict the jury must have determined otherwise.  30I am, however, prepared to accept that he was given access to the silver sealed foil sheath containing the tablets or he was then given such other number of pills as he requested, but given the clear terms of the warning and the presence of young children in that household that may be riding in the car, I am not prepared to find she said nothing about the warning. It is likely that she said to him, ""You're not allowed to drive once you have taken these,"" or words to that effect.  31On this basis I find his decision to drive was in the face of that warning and a second-hand description of the major context of the warning, namely that he was not to drive. I accept that the basis of the warning, that is, it may affect his mental alertness and/or concentration (see Exhibit I), was never given to him, and if he had seen the warning he would not have understood that.  32I am satisfied the driving from the time the passengers in the Corolla heard the offender's engine noise to the time of impact was driving that constituted driving in a manner dangerous to other persons. The manner that made it dangerous to others was the decision to pass all cars, including the lead car, rather than merge in accordance with the sign, or to form one lane in accordance with that sign, failing to slow down when the Subaru's inner wheels came on to the gravel, and failure to brake and failure to steer into the rear end swerve. Further, during all of that, the speed of the vehicle was excessive and is a further feature of dangerous driving.  Objective Criminality  33From the facts as he finds them to be, a sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by judges when they compare objectively the criminality exhibited in the case before the court, with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact on the overall sentencing outcome.  34The roads of the state of New South Wales are for the most part owned by one of three levels of government, that is, the federal government, the state government or the municipal government. Many people think that they have a right to drive. No, there is no inherent right to drive upon the roads. They are not the private property of any individual. Only those accorded the privilege of a licence are entitled to drive upon the roads. Licences are only issued to those who, by submitting themselves to tests on their driving skills and their knowledge of the road rules, agree to be bound by the rules of the road, so that the safety of other users of the road is assured. Passengers in motor vehicles are properly described as other users of the road. In addition to the road rules, the criminal law has also been harnessed to punish those who, as a consequence of dangerous driving or driving whilst there is present in their blood, alcohol or a drug, cause a vehicle collision as a result of which really serious injury or death is caused to another.  35The criminality of the offences before me has to be evaluated against that background. Many offenders - and I have no doubt this offender would be one of them - have difficulty understanding that offences of the kind before me are criminal, yes, criminal offences, as distinct from a driving offence, because they - or in this case, he - did not intend any harm to his victims. From a victim's point-of-view, of course, he or she did nothing towards the offender that caused this injury to them. It is true that criminal law does have a role to play where offenders with malice do violence to others. But it is also true that the criminal law has a role to play where drivers, through their own unlawful driving conduct, cause injury or death to others.  36While each of the two charges focuses upon the harm done to other users of the road, it should be noted that there were potentially other victims, at least on my count six others, who were exposed to risk of injury as a result of his driving. If I include him it would make seven others.  37The court is very mindful that the first charge relates to the death of Elisapeta Faimata. Those in her family should understand that courts, when sentencing for offences such as this- judicial officers including myself, feel great sympathy and condolence for families who have lost someone in such circumstances. I will in a moment come to the impact of her death upon family and the loss to this community of a person through death. It is the loss of the person to the community through death that is being punished.  38From the court's point-of-view, although we know Ms Faimata was, within her family, viewed as a wonderful person, all persons who have been victims are regarded as being of equal merit. The court is also aware, of course, that death is a very permanent outcome.  39The second charge focuses upon injury inflicted to his young son. That injury is set out in some detail in Exhibit S11. He was four years old on 15 April when he was admitted to hospital. He had initially been assessed at the scene of the accident as having a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10 out of 15. This dropped to 3 out of 15 while he was being transported to Liverpool Hospital.  40At Liverpool Hospital he was found to have a fluctuating level of consciousness, with his GCS ranging between 5 and 9 out of 15. He was described as combative. He was stabilised, including being intubated, ventilated and then transferred to CHW where he was admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. He was seen by the rehabilitation team on 19 April 2007, when it was noted he was extubated, confused and had periods of agitation. It was felt that he remained confused, and with his abnormal behaviour he was felt to be clinically in post-traumatic amnesia.  41It should be noted that he was at that stage too young for a standardised assessment of post-traumatic amnesia. He was initially unsteady on his feet, he had some reduced strength on the right side, improving over time. He had some difficulty talking. His behaviour was described as perseverative, including eating excessively, being stuck on certain topics of conversation, and he was found to be impulsive. Some of these problems were noted by his family to be a continuation of his behaviour prior to the collision. He was also noted to be more prone to tantrums. All behaviours were consistent with sequelae from traumatic brain injury.  42WEB's other injuries included a right middle cranial fossa, extradural haematoma, a right frontal subdural haematoma, contusion on the right temporal part of the brain and some cerebral oedema. There was a fracture of the right orbit with right eyelid laceration. Fracture of the right sphenoid and frontal bones. This child had a pre-existing history of congenital toxoplasmosis with inter cranial calcifications and some scarring of his right eye with right divergent squint.  43He was seen by the ophthalmologist service. His eyesight readings were 6/24 to 6/48 on the right side and on the left 6/6 and 6/9. In other words, better eyesight on the left side. Overall, there was a slight reduction it was thought of visual acuity on the right side pre-accident compared to after accident. The diagnosis at the time of the collision until his release on 4 May was that he had sustained a severe traumatic brain injury.  44He was temporary enrolled in and after two years has become a permanent participant in the lifetime care scheme. He was noted to have difficulty talking immediately after the accident and the family reported a deterioration of his language skills including difficulty finding the right word. Formal speech therapy was instituted, he was seen for occupation therapy focusing on his eye moveabilities and organisational skills as well as some self care support.  45Dr Smith, his eye specialist, in July 2008 came to the opinion that he had significantly decreased visual acuity in the right eye compared to the pre-accident situation. The family were also noticing behaviour difficulties and were receiving counselling for this.  46Two years after the accident in April 2009 he was reviewed. It was thought that he was making good progress particularly in area of his behaviour, still noted, however, were impulsive and angry outbursts. It was also noted cognitive fatigue was a significant problem for him. It seems he needed to sleep for a couple of hours after finishing school and tiredness brought on headaches. Surgery was planned for the right eye towards the end of 2009 but I have not been informed of the result of that.  47Three years after the accident he was reviewed again. His cognitive fatigue was still a feature. Occupational therapy, speech therapy and psychological support were still continuing.  48Dr Stephen O'Flaherty in his report from which I have been reading in Exhibit S11 notes that it is early in the recovery for a child as young as WEB as far as his brain injury is concerned. Any decision about long term sequelae from brain injury in children is usually delayed until after they have finished school.  49In July 2009 the son was needing a special teacher and having difficulties in school. There is some difficulty in determining what his pre-existing disabilities were by comparison with his disabilities after the trauma of the collision. One thing is certain that the trauma of the collision had greater impact upon him than it may have had upon a child who was not in a pre-existing precarious situation. I am of the view that the damage done as a consequence of the collision is long term but I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it is lifelong damage.  50An offence of driving under the influence of a drug requires no more than the prosecution to prove the offender was driving, had present a quantity of the drug and his driving was to some degree impaired or influenced by the consumption of the drug and a collision resulted.  51A measure of the moral culpability may also arise from the manner and course of driving in a case where someone is driving under the influence of a drug. So far as this offence is concerned the course of driving dangerously to another person or other persons is less than 500 metres and closer to 250 metres. But the manner of driving reached a point where it was dangerous to other users of the road.  52Earlier I highlighted features which brought the driving to that level. The manner of driving impacts adversely to the accused in my assessment of his moral culpability. Into this mix must also be thrown the circumstance of his consumption of the drug. I have reviewed that in my fact finding.  53Mr Steirn SC sought to argue the moral culpability arising from this factor was low. He also sought to argue that a mistake, an honest mistake, made by the offender over arched all other assessments of moral culpability. Each of these submissions has been rejected. Nonetheless, there is no driving with malice or high speed or a higher level of inebriation through alcohol or [illegal] drugs or the ignoring of any warning given whilst driving recklessly furiously or dangerously.  54While the level of Phentermine may have been three times or nearly three times the therapeutic level it is difficult to equate that in terms of alcohol levels of high range, mid range or low range. I have regarded it as an equivalent of medium or middle range not high range and not certainly above low (as said) range. However, the warning he had been given by his wife, limited as it was, was ignored. I must understand that that warning has not been proved to have been given immediately before the driving commenced and the reality is it is more likely to have been given at a time when the pills were handed to him.  55My finding is no more than the wife must have told him of the warning on the packet. Likewise the Court is not dealing with low moral culpability arising from momentary inattention or misjudgement. The words ""low"" or ""high"" do not describe the moral culpability of this offender. He has driven contrary to a warning on a packet that was not fully explained to him. His driving reached a point of being dangerous to others, but it was only over a short course. It resulted in the death of one, on the first charge, and the very serious long term injury of another, the second charge. In those circumstances the moral culpability is best described as substantial.  Victim Impact Statements  56Now I come to the victim impact statements. I have received victim impact statements from members of the family. The statements are not sworn evidence and have not been the subject to cross-examination. Any opinions expressed in the statements are not those of a qualified expert. Victim impact statements coming as they do from family members will not become evidence in the case.  57The function of statements such as this one is to give to victims an opportunity of being heard in sentencing proceedings by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma that are visited upon them by the deceased of their loved one or their relative by the actions of an offender. Secondly, it enables them in sentencing proceedings to assist them as they moved towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding from the criminal conduct of an offender. It gives an opportunity to the offender to at least hear first hand and perhaps gain some insight into the consequences his offending and conduct had upon the family of the victim, Finally, of course, it serves as a reminder for judges such as myself of the terrible impact that criminal conduct can have upon the men and women who are its victims, or in this case its secondary victims.  58The first of the victim impact statements I want to read is from the deceased's mother, and her name is Lupe. She describes herself as the mother of Elisapeta.  ""On 14 April it was a strange and different day in my whole life. Happiness was turned to sadness. I never thought something like this accident would happen to my child. My happiness is very much incomplete because of the passing of one that was so strong in helping our family. My right hand child who helped me a great deal in our family. She was the one I trusted and depended upon for everything. I feel weak in my whole body and in my heart because I am not seeing my complete and whole family who had been given to me by God... Most of the time now I miss her so much. She had two jobs, was a hardworking person for the benefit and future of our family. She fixed and settled anything like problems, disputes, anything around the house, in our home, and so on. I depended on her for taking care of her brothers and sisters and she did whatever they wanted or asked of her. Everything Elisapeta would do. When this sad news came I did not want to hear such news about death. The sweet and lovely fellowship with your children is a wonderful thing. I said in my heart Espa, I want to die for you instead of you, in your place. I wish that you will come back to life. A life replaces a life. My painful heart will not forget this dreadful stab that pierced my heart. It is so heartbreaking. My daughter will never come back to life again.""  The elder brother, Penasone, wrote that his sister was:  ""An unselfish person who dedicated most of her life to better others, even us as her siblings. We have been truly blessed to have the privilege of having her care and guidance for most of our lives, particularly mine. The sudden death of our sister pretty much lowered our confidence level to take difficult tasks in our lives. It shattered the guidance we relied on for a long time. We no longer have the voice of encouragement we lived by. We no longer have her cheering us up in times of sadness. She was our teacher in many ways, as we all looked up to her. She replaced our father after he passed away, taking on the biggest role and responsibilities and difficulties [in the family]. Being the older of us to learn, understand and experience his love and care which we felt was shining through her. She would keep us in touch with our faith/religion. After all it was the backbone to everything she taught us. She left a lot of positive signatures behind in this world and that's what makes us, her family, so proud of her.""  Her younger sister, Urima, writes this:  ""Losing my sister has affected a big part of my life. My beloved sister was noble, encouraging, caring, loving, honest, basically everything you would love and admire in a person. She was no doubt the rock of my family. I know for sure it wasn't her time to go. She had goals and aims to reach. She would go for gold to get whatever she wanted. Now that she's gone all I have left are memories. When saying our goodbyes I would say 'I love you', she always said, 'I love you more'. Even thinking about her is heartbreaking still. When my sister died my heart broke into bits and pieces. Two years have now passed by but there is no change. I've turned into a negative person, always feeling bitter. I'm always angry and I don't really know why. The death of my sister has woken me up. I am living in fear, I can die within the blink of an eye. I tried to get it together, I can't help but lash out at anyone, I will never be that nice, bubbly, good hearted girl I was once was. I will never be the same again.""  The younger two siblings, Silivale, a sister aged fifteen writes this:  ""Elisapeta Faimata, this name brings back so many memories that I treasure and will never forget. She was everything to me. It also brings tears to my eyes knowing that someone killed her and knowing that she is not here, physically, any more. She was a big part of my life and still is. When I first heard that she passed away I thought they were lying and then I realised that she was never going to come back. She was my hope on getting through school. She still is. She was always there every time something went wrong. She worked at a childcare centre. She was a caring person, a person that always smiled and kept her head up even when times were hard. Why did that man take her life?""  The last one is from a younger brother, Vaega:  ""I was the last to know that my sister had died. After two years I can't believe that she's gone. I miss her to bits and pieces. If I had to make a wish it would be that I want my family back to be my family.""  59I should note that in each of those, particularly the last four statements, I have edited a substantial portion out.  Subjective Features  60I turn now to subjective features. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the two offences, but I am also sentencing this offender for them. Every offender coming before the Court varies from others who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of these offences by him or some reason why a more a less sentencing outcome is appropriate.  61MMEB is thirty-six years old on my calculation, thirty-two at the time of the impact. He is the father of two children. He lives with his wife and children in south west Sydney, a place called Rossmore. He came to Australia in 1999, on my calculations aged twenty-four, from a Lebanese village. He has been driving in Australia less than seven years when this collision occurred. He has been married for twelve. He lives in a farm in rented accommodation. He is one of twelve siblings, most of whom are modest achievers, one of whom is deaf and dumb.  Education, Employment & Skills  62MMEB was schooled in the Lebanon until Year 4 level. He is barely literate in Arabic and not literate in English. His numeracy skills are also limited. He is unemployed. He last worked as a panel beater in 2007. He has an uncle in Lebanon who taught him mechanics and metal trades, but without any formal education component, so he has no trade certificates. He worked with his father on the family farm. His only income stream appears to come from Centrelink benefits.  Mental Health Issues  63Dr Roberts, retained by the defence, a clinical psychiatrist, did not point to any diagnosis of serious mental health problems that would impede rehabilitation. He noted symptoms consistent with a label of anxiety that he would place in the moderate to severe spectrum. The offender is on antidepressant medication. There has been no IQ assessment, however Dr Westmore, who also examined the offender in October 2010, said he presents as being of dull average to very low average intelligence. Mae Abu Mahmoud, a psychologist, assessed his IQ, general ability as extremely low. His overall thinking and reasoning abilities are also extremely low.  64The offender ruminates about a younger brother who was killed in a motor vehicle event as he and that brother were crossing a road. The brother was aged five or perhaps eight. The offender, as I say, is not good on history, and the offender at that time was ten or perhaps thirteen. The two were holding hands, which makes me suspect the earlier version, five and ten is probably correct. Crossing the road when the brother was wrenched from his grip by being struck by a car and being dragged some distance by the car until he was dead. The offender says this event has recalled that memory for him.  Drug & Alcohol Issues  65There is no record or report of any drug or alcohol issues that would impede rehabilitation.  Character  66For the purpose of sentencing he should be regarded as a person of good character. There is a take and drive conveyance matter, but in respect of that matter he received a discharge and a bond. His traffic record shows his first offence of speeding occurred whilst on a learner's licence in January 2001. A provisional licence was issued to him in February of 2001. His first licence suspension was in September 2001 because of loss of demerit points. In 2002 there is a negligent driving charge suggesting some impact or collision. A second suspension occurred in August 2006, again because of a loss of demerit points. There was a second speeding offence in October 2006, apparently occurring whilst the licence was suspended. His licence was suspended again on 29 September 2007, it would seem because of or on account of these charges. He reported to Dr Westmore that on one occasion he ran his motor vehicle into a telegraph pole. He was not charged.  Attitude to the Offence  67I am satisfied there is genuine contrition in the sense that the offender is very sorry for the death he caused and for the injury he caused to his son. On the other hand, I accept Dr Roberts' assessment that he does not fully understand or appreciate the injuries caused to his boy. The offender is, of course, an unsophisticated, uneducated man with intellectual deficits and poor comprehension functioning. His lack of insight and understanding must be viewed against his capacity for higher brain functioning required for those tasks. I doubt it is a case of wilful blindness to the boy's injuries, but rather an inability to appreciate the significance of them.  Rehabilitation Prospects  68This is the offender's first serious criminal offending. Unlike other criminal activity this criminal conduct occurred whilst the offender was in pursuit of a normal, indeed a laudable activity. He was setting out to visit a friend who was in hospital. There is no suggestion he is part of the criminal milieu, he simply drove appallingly at this point in time. He has shown a disregard in the past to RTA regulations. While there are significant breaches on his traffic record none of them are major offences.  69I am concerned that he may have an inability to understand road signs that are designed to provide and improve road safety. Driving offences are all about the safety of the public and I am concerned only in respect of one aspect of his rehabilitation and that centres on an inability to understand road signs. Before he can resume driving this matter will need to be addressed. Otherwise I have no reason for believing his rehabilitation will not be strong.  Deterrence  70Normally when a judge is sentencing general deterrence should be given considerable weight so that others will be deterred from offending. This is not a case, however, in which general deterrence should apply. Since Anderson's [1981] VR 155 case the law has recognised that persons with mental health problems are not appropriate vehicles for general deterrence. Those with intellectual deficits, particularly when the deficits are substantial, are likewise not suitable cases for apply the doctrine of general deterrence. Nonetheless, personal deterrence is appropriate and that will be achieved by a sentence of imprisonment and a term of non-parole given to this offender.  Guideline Judgment  71The guideline judgment in respect of these kind of offences ( R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343) postulated that where an offender's moral culpability is high a full time custodial sentence of less than three years, in the case of death, and two years in the case of grievous bodily harm would generally not be appropriate. That guideline was set, I have no doubt, with a component of general deterrence playing some part in postulating what was an inappropriate sentence nominated. Where general deterrence is not to play a part in the sentencing my view is that a sentence of three years for death and two years for grievous bodily harm are appropriate for high moral culpability. However, I have described the offences I am dealing with as less than high. I have described them as substantial. I have found they are serious examples of moral culpability. I have determined that severe punishment should be a principle component of the sentencing disposition. I have settled on a sentence of two and a half years imprisonment in respect of the dangerous driving causing the death of Elisapeta Faimata and eighteen months in respect of the dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm to his son. It can be seen from the sentencing disposition I have chosen that the offences require punishment of the greatest kind the law can require in New South Wales, loss of freedom through incarceration.  72I intend to find special circumstances. Two of the doctors noted, in fact it may have been more, that the offender's intelligence is so compromised that he may, for that reason, be targeted by other prisoners. I find that fear to be well founded. My second reason is that his own child has behavioural issues which are likely to be exacerbated by his absence. This gives an ironic twist to the sentence whereby the punishment of the father for the crime of driving dangerously may lead to the exacerbation of at least one of the symptoms of the child's disabilities arising from damage caused by the father through the collision. Such a situation will make the offender's time in incarceration more onerous for him. I have assumed that the offender has spent no time in custody.  SOWAID: That's correct your Honour.  HIS HONOUR: Mr MMEB, you need to stand up at this point if you would please.  73MMEB, you are convicted that you, on 14 April 2007 at Hoxton Park in the State of New South Wales, did drive a motor vehicle, a Subaru Impreza, when it was involved in an impact occasioning the death of Elisapeta Faimata, and at the time of that impact you were driving the vehicle while you were under the influence of a drug known as Phentermine. For that offence you are convicted and sentenced to a non-parole period of fifteen months to commence on 4 December 2011 and expire on 3 March 2013. The balance of term will expire on 3 September 2014.  74You are also convicted that, at the same time and place, and in the same circumstances, namely that you drove a motor vehicle at a time when you were under the influence of a drug, namely Phentermine, and your vehicle was involved in an impact causing grievous bodily harm to your son, WEB, you are convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of eighteen months to commence from 4 March 2011, and to expire on 3 September 2012.  75The effect of that should be an incarceration period of two years commencing today, with an additional term of fifteen months after that, making an overall sentence of three years and three months.  76I am going to disqualify the offender from driving in respect of both offences until 28 September 2013. I note that he has been disqualified since 2009. So it is a period of disqualification of effectively four years. I am cancelling his licence until he passes the knowledge test. I require that a personal photograph identification of him is to be presented on the occasion and every occasion that he sits for that test and that such identification is to be verified against the records held by the RTA in respect of his past licences.  77The effect of what I am seeking to do is that he is not to drive until such time as the community can be sure that he can read the signs on the road. It is not intended that he be without a licence forever, it is simply until such time as he can pass the knowledge test and know all the signs. Any family member present? No. The offender may be taken into custody.  **********

2413986,Ta and Nguyen v R [2011] NSWCCA 32,"Judgment 

1JAMES J: Thi Dung Ta and Phi Hung Nguyen appealed against their convictions after a joint trial in the District Court before his Honour Judge Bennett and a jury on a charge that on 22 November 2007 they knowingly took part in the cultivation by enhanced indoor means of not less than the large commercial quantity of cannabis plants. In the event of their appeals against conviction being unsuccessful, they applied for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on them. By consent the two appeals and applications for leave to appeal were heard together. 

2At the trial of the two appellants they were also indicted on a charge of cultivating by enhanced indoor means not less than the large commercial quantity of cannabis plants. At the direction of the trial judge the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on this charge in favour of both appellants. 

3At the trial the Crown case against the appellants depended on evidence that on 22 November 2007 the two appellants were together at premises at 14 Tennyson Street, Campsie. It was not in dispute that at those premises a large number of cannabis plants exceeding the number set by the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act as being the large commercial quantity were being cultivated by enhanced indoor means. 

The Crown evidence at the trial 

4The Crown evidence at the trial may be briefly summarised as follows. 

5A police officer Constable Dodd gave evidence that on 22 November 2007 from about 2.30pm he conducted surveillance outside the premises at 14 Tennyson Street, Campsie from an unmarked vehicle with tinted windows. He had a direct uninterrupted view of the premises, being a two-story brick house with a garage. Between the time of his arrival and about 5.05pm no one entered the premises from the front of the house. 

6At about 5.05pm Constable Dodd saw the garage door of the premises open revealing a motor vehicle registration AQT24K parked inside the garage. Shortly afterwards two persons of Asian appearance walked out of the garage, one male and one female. There was no dispute at the trial that the male person observed by Constable Dodd was the appellant Nguyen and that the female person observed by Constable Dodd was the appellant Ta and that the vehicle in the garage was owned by Ta. 

7Ta walked to a garbage bin on the nature strip and moved the bin some distance. Nguyen had some papers in his hands, which he placed in the garbage bin. The two appellants then walked back inside the garage and the door of the garage was closed. 

8At about 6.10pm Constable Dodd again saw the door of the garage open revealing Ta's vehicle inside the garage. The vehicle was reversed out of the garage. Nguyen was driving the vehicle and Ta was in the front passenger seat. 

9Constable Dodd remained outside the premises until about 8.15pm. During this further period he did no see any person enter the premises. 

10Constable Dodd was cross-examined on a number of matters. 

11In cross-examination Constable Dodd said that on 22 November 2007 he was equipped with a still camera and a digital camera. He agreed in cross-examination that there was no photograph or video footage of any moving of the garbage bin or any placing of papers in the bin, although ""two persons emerging from the premises was a significant development"". Constable Dodd offered the explanations that there was a broken mirror in the lens of the camera such that ""a lot of photos came out black"" and that a number of compact disks in the video camera had failed to operate. 

12In cross-examination Constable Dodd denied that what had occurred at 5.05pm on 22 November 2007 was that the vehicle had been driven into the driveway and into the garage. 

13Constable Dodd agreed that he had communicated what he had seen at 5.05pm to his supervisor Detective Sergeant Liddiard by radio. There was no recording of the communication and Constable Dodd himself did not make any note of the communication. 

14Detective-Sergeant Liddiard did make a note of the communication, which appeared to be inconsistent with part of Constable Dodd's evidence. The note made by Detective-Sergeant Liddiard stated that the vehicle under surveillance ""pulled into D/Way and Drove into Drive"". Constable Dodd maintained that the evidence he had given was correct and that what Detective-Sergeant Liddiard had written down was wrong. 

15Constable Dodd denied that his attempts to rectify the malfunctioning of his cameras had interfered with his observations of the house. 

16Detective-Sergeant Liddiard gave evidence that on the afternoon of 22 November 2007 he also was conducting surveillance but in a separate vehicle from Constable Dodd. From his location Detective-Sergeant Liddiard could not see the front of the house at 14 Tennyson Street. Another police officer Constable Campos was also conducting surveillance from a third vehicle, which was not in Tennyson Street at 5.05pm. 

17At about 6.10pm Detective-Sergeant Liddiard observed Ta's vehicle turning out of Tennyson Street into another street. Shortly afterwards the vehicle in which the appellants were travelling was pulled over by police and the appellants were arrested and taken to a police station. Both appellants declined to be interviewed by police. 

18It will be necessary to refer in detail to parts of Detective-Sergeant Liddiard's evidence in considering the appellants' grounds of appeal. 

19Constable Campos was unable to give evidence at the trial because of an injury he had suffered. By consent evidence given by him at a previous aborted trial of the appellants was read to the jury. 

20After the appellants were arrested a search warrant was executed at the premises 14 Tennyson Street. Police gained entry to the premises by forcing the front door off its hinges with an implement. Inside the house police found a total of 551 cannabis plants at various stages of maturity, hydroponic lighting, numerous pieces of electrical equipment such as transformers, fans and timer switches, an irrigation system, fertiliser and electronic scales. 

21Evidence was given by police officers about the means of access to the premises. All of the windows in the house and the rear sliding door had roller shutters or black plastic covers over them. Numerous bags of potting mix directly behind the front door prevented that door from being opened. There was another door to the premises near the kitchen but this was obstructed by a large fish tank. Police concluded that the means of access to the house was through a door in the garage. 

22The garage to the house had a roller door which was operated by remote control. Constable Dodd gave evidence that, because police did not have a remote device for opening the garage door, he had had to manually open the door ""through pulling a cord and getting it on free stance"". 

23The vehicle owned by the appellant Ta was searched. A set of keys was found which included a remote control device for use on the vehicle. There was no key in the set which could be used to gain access to the house. Neither of the appellants was carrying a key which could access the house. 

24The owner of 14 Tennyson Street gave evidence that he had purchased the property in the year 2000, that he had moved out of the property in 2007 and that he had leased it to a man he had never previously met. The owner disclaimed having any knowledge that his property was going to be used for the cultivation of cannabis plants. 

25A total of 24 fingerprints from various items in the house were detected and developed but none of them matched the fingerprints of either appellant. 

26Some items which had been found in the house, including three cigarette butts, were submitted for DNA analysis. DNA recovered from one of the cigarette butts was found to have the same DNA profile as the appellant Ta. The profile of DNA recovered from a second cigarette butt was only a partial profile and matched the corresponding partial profile of Ta. DNA testing of the third cigarette butt was unsuccessful. 

The defence cases at the trial 

27The appellant Ta gave evidence at the trial through an interpreter. The following is a fairly brief summary of her evidence-in-chief. 

28Ta knew the appellant Nguyen through her friendship with his mother, whom she had known in Vietnam. 

29On the evening of 21 November 2007 Nguyen, who lived in Melbourne, arrived suddenly at Ta's home in Sydney. He told Ta that he was looking for his father. Nguyen stayed at Ta's home on the night of 21 November 2007. 

30Ta got up late, in the afternoon, on 22 November 2007. Nguyen told Ta that he wanted to go to Campsie but did not have any transport. The appellants left for Campsie in Ta's vehicle with Nguyen driving. They did some shopping near Campsie railway station. Nguyen supplied Ta with the address 14 Tennyson Street, the appellants consulted a street directory and Nguyen drove Ta's vehicle to Tennyson Street. 

31When the vehicle had arrived and had stopped in front of the garage at 14 Tennyson Street, Ta got out of the vehicle. She saw a garbage bin near the driveway and she moved the garbage bin, because she was worried that her vehicle might hit the garbage bin. 

32Ta saw some advertising material lying in the front yard of 14 Tennyson Street and she picked it up. Some of the pages of the advertising material were dirty and she put those pages in the garbage bin. She kept the clean pages because she wanted to see if anything cheap was being advertised. 

33When the appellants had arrived at 14 Tennyson Street, the door to the garage was not open. When Ta went back to the car, after picking up the advertising material, the garage door was open. She did not know how the garage door became open. She did not have in her car any remote control device for opening the garage door. 

34After the car had been driven into the garage, Nguyen went into the house saying to Ta ""Could you please wait for me. I am going to see my friend just only for a short time, then I will be back"". Ta then sat in the car for about 10 to 15 minutes reading the advertising material. 

35After about 10 to 15 minutes Ta got out of the car and knocked at the door leading from the garage into the house. Nobody answered the door. Ta turned the handle of the door, which was not locked, and looked inside. She saw Nguyen talking with ""his friend"" in the kitchen area, where there was a fish tank. Nguyen's friend asked Nguyen, ""whether your aunty wants to have a drink"". 

36Ta walked to the tap in the kitchen, got herself a drink of water and smoked a cigarette. She disposed of the cigarette in an ashtray in the kitchen. 

37Ta remained in the kitchen for 10 to 12 minutes. She then went back to the car, because there was a smell in the house which made her uncomfortable and there were bags of ""black garbage"" in the house. 

38Ta waited for a time in the car but as Nguyen had not returned she entered the house a second time. Nguyen was no longer in the kitchen and she went looking for him. She pulled a piece of plastic aside and looked into a room which contained a number of plants. Nguyen was not in that room. Ta called out Nguyen's name but there was no response. While Ta was in the house a second time she smoked more cigarettes. 

39Ta went back to the car. Nguyen eventually returned to the car. By this time Ta had a headache and was lying in the car with her eyes closed. Nguyen reversed the car out of the garage. Ta did not know how the garage door was opened. 

40Ta estimated that she and Nguyen were at the premises for ""around more or less than an hour"". She said that she had never been to the house before and had not had any involvement in the cultivation of the plants in the house. 

41Ta was cross-examined about a number of matters about which she had given evidence in chief. 

42The appellant Nguyen did not give evidence at the trial. As previously mentioned, he had declined to be interviewed by police after he was arrested. To the extent that there was any positive defence case for Nguyen at the trial, it was based on Ta's evidence and particularly evidence given by Ta when she was cross-examined by counsel for Nguyen. 

43Ta gave evidence in cross-examination by counsel for Nguyen that in November 2007 Nguyen was living with his mother in Melbourne. His father, from whom his mother had been divorced, was living in Sydney and Nguyen had not had any contact with his father for a long time. Nguyen's mother had told Ta that Nguyen wished to re-establish contact with his father. On 22 November 2007 Nguyen did not know how to get to Tennyson Street, Campsie and Ta had given him directions from a street directory. 

The grounds of appeal 

44The grounds of appeal against conviction of the appellant Nguyen were:- 

1. The trial judge erred in determining that the question ""[d]id you find anything similar to a remote control for a garage door?"" was not leading. 

2. The trial judge erred in admitting opinion and hearsay evidence relating to an object seen by Detective Liddiard during the search of vehicle AQT24K. 

3. The trial miscarried owing to the failure of the trial judge to discharge the jury following adducing the evidence the subject of Grounds 1 and 2. 

45The sole ground of appeal against conviction of the appellant Ta was:- 

The refusal of the trial judge to discharge the jury following the admission of evidence to the effect that an item in the appellant's vehicle was the remote control to the garage door of the premises in which the cultivation occurred gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. 

46The sole ground of appeal of the appellant Ta was substantially the same as the third ground of appeal of the appellant Nguyen and the matters referred to in the first two grounds of appeal of the appellant Nguyen were in fact also relied on by counsel for Ta in support of Ta's ground of appeal. In the circumstances, it is convenient to deal with all the grounds of appeal together. 

Relevant parts of the trial transcript 

47For a proper consideration of the grounds of appeal it is necessary to refer in some detail to parts of the trial transcript. 

48I have already referred briefly to some of the evidence given at the trial by Detective-Sergeant Liddiard. Detective-Sergeant Liddiard gave evidence in his evidence-in-chief that, after the car in which the appellants were travelling was stopped by police, the car was searched. The following questions and answers then occurred:- 

Q. Did you find anything similar to a remote control for a garage door? 
A. Yes I did. 

Q. Tell us about that please? 
A. In the car above the radio was a small space in the dashboard. Inside there was a small remote device which had a number of buttons on it. That was about all, I took notice of that. It was probably about the size of a fifty cent piece. 

Q. Did you take possession of it? 
A. No I did not. 

Q. What happened to it? 
A. I put it back where I found it in the car. 

Q. Did you, at that time, think that it had any relation to your investigation? 
A. No I did not. 

Q. What subsequently became of it? 
A. My understanding is it remained in the car. We were later told of its relevance to this investigation but we didn't return to the car and the car had since left the - where it was left by on the day. 

49It is to be noted that there was no objection by counsel for either appellant to any part of this evidence. 

50In cross-examination of Detective-Sergeant Liddiard by counsel for Ta the following questions and answers occurred:- 

Q. Constable, you've given some evidence that you saw an electronic device or some sort of item in the dash, in the centre of the vehicle. Is that right? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Can you describe that again for me please? 
A. It was a small remote control, it was on a key ring from recollection. It was probably about the size of a 50 cent piece and that was in the small sort of compartment area above the radio of the car. 

Q. And you never established what that was for, is that right? 
A. I was later told that it was the remote for the garage. 

Q. Who told you that? 
A. Possibly-- 

HOGAN(counsel for Nguyen): I object your Honour, 

DENNIS: Sorry, I withdraw the question. 

HIS HONOUR: Well just so that the record is clear, that was an objection by Mr Hogan. 

DENNIS 
Q. Sir you never retrieved that advice (as said) and tested it on anything could you? 
A. No I did not. 

A. And so you didn't test to see whether it was indeed the remote switch to - such as the central locking switch for the vehicle? 
A. No I did not. 

51After the cross-examination of Detective-Sergeant Liddiard had finished the Crown Prosecutor made an application in the absence of the jury that he be permitted in re-examination to elicit who had told Detective-Sergeant Liddiard that the item found in the car was the remote control for the garage at 14 Tennyson Street. It would appear that the person who had told Detective-Sergeant Liddiard this information was the appellant Nguyen, when he was speaking to police after his arrest. The Crown had refrained from attempting to lead evidence from Detective-Sergeant Liddiard about what Nguyen had said, apparently on the basis that the Crown accepted that any such evidence would have been evidence of an admission to which s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act would apply and the conditions under that section for evidence being admissible were not satisfied. 

52After the Crown Prosecutor had made the application, the trial judge raised what appeared to his Honour to be a number of issues about the application and the Crown Prosecutor then withdrew his application. 

53After the evidence of Detective-Sergeant Liddiard had finished, the Crown Prosecutor by consent read to the jury the evidence which had been given at the previous trial by Detective Campos. 

54Late in the afternoon of the same day counsel for Ta made an application for the discharge of the jury based on the evidence given by Detective-Sergeant Liddiard which I have quoted and particularly his evidence in his evidence-in-chief that ""we were later told of its relevance to this investigation"" and his evidence in cross-examination that ""I was later told that it was the remote for the garage"". 

55Counsel for Nguyen joined in the application for the discharge of the jury. 

56On the day on which the application was first made the argument on the application was conducted in the absence of any transcript of the evidence which had been given by Detective-Sergeant Liddiard. The trial judge decided to defer giving a final decision on the application until after he had had the opportunity of reading a transcript of the evidence. 

57On the following day, after the transcript of the evidence of the previous day had been obtained there was further argument on the application for the discharge of the jury. Submissions made in support of the application included that the question asked by the Crown Prosecutor, ""Did you find anything similar to a remote control for the garage door?"" was a leading question; that that question called for an expression of opinion on a matter as to which there was no evidence that the witness had any expertise; that the evidence of the finding of something which was merely ""similar"" to a remote control for a garage door was irrelevant; that Detective-Sergeant Liddiard had given evidence which was hearsay evidence; and that there was a danger of unfair prejudice in that the jury might think that there was a basis for connecting the item found in the car with the door to the garage; and that there was no direction the trial judge could give which would remove the danger of unfair prejudice. 

58Submissions made by the Crown Prosecutor in opposing the application included that the question he had asked was not a leading question, that the evidence given by the witness was not expert evidence and that the evidence was relevant. 

59The trial judge refused the application for the discharge of the jury, delivering a judgment. In the judgment his Honour referred at some length to a number of parts of the evidence, including the evidence given by Detective-Sergeant Liddiard which I have quoted. His Honour made certain findings of fact, including a finding that the only rational inference to draw was that the occupants of the vehicle had had the means to remotely operate the garage door and that the evidence of the finding of the device in the vehicle, when combined with other evidence, would permit an inference to be drawn that the appellants had ready access to the premises by way of the garage door. 

60The part of his Honour's judgment headed ""The Decision"" in which his Honour stated his reasoning for his decision not to discharge the jury was quite brief and was as follows:- 

""I am not persuaded that the question that gave rise to this application at page 46 of the transcript, line 27 was objectionable. I am not persuaded that it was in the nature of a leading question. I am not persuaded that it requires the application of principles relevant to opinion evidence, and I am not persuaded that it has no or limited probative value. I am not persuaded that there is any risk of unfair prejudice to the accused from the admission of this evidence, and I am not persuaded that it is appropriate that the jury be discharged. 

Accordingly, in each case the application is refused"". 

61The trial judge did not strike out any of the evidence given by Detective-Sergeant Liddiard and no application was made to him by counsel for either appellant to strike out any of the evidence. 

62In the Crown Prosecutor's closing address to the jury he said:- 

""The discovery of what appeared to be a remote control device in the console or near the console of the car that Sergeant Liddiard described is a circumstantial - you don't know whether it really was the remote control device for that garage. You don't know definitely, you don't know certainly, it wasn't tested, and no-one claimed that it was anything other than a remote control device for something. That wasn't challenged. If it wasn't for the garage, well that's for you to add into the pot of facts that you're going to have. 

The Crown submission is this though. It would have been a rather different situation if no remote control device had been found in the car at all. What would you then have thought about the sort of access that people might have to that particular house at 14 Tennyson Street. Because you've been told, and there is nothing to suggest otherwise that the only way of getting in and out of that house realistically was through the roller door. So that was the key, a remote control device was the key, and the Crown says it was a remote control device was found in the car, it's a circumstance and when taken together with other evidence, you will be satisfied that they had access to that house. A very important point ladies and gentlemen, they had access to that house."" 

63In his summing up at page 30 the trial judge referred to ""a sighting of what Detective Liddiard said was a remote control device in the vehicle"". 

64At pages 44-45 of the summing up his Honour said:- 

""There was no remote control identified in that process (of searching) other than the Honda remote control with the car key and other keys. Sergeant Liddiard said he saw a device in a compartment in the dashboard of the car above the radio with buttons, which he believed was a remote control. However he did not seize the item and there is no evidence that it was in fact a remote control - that is direct evidence - or that it was the remote control for this house. 

Therefore, the mere reference to that item where found would not prove conclusively beyond reasonable doubt that it was the remote control for this garage door. However you would not consider the sighting of that item in isolation, but within the matrix of facts that are before you, including the search of the accused and of the vehicle, the access of the vehicle to and from the house through the electronically-operated garage door, when considering whether the circumstances combine to persuade you that the item seen by the police officer was the remote control giving access to the house"". 

65At pages 58-59 of the summing up the trial judge quoted all of the evidence given by Detective-Sergeant Liddiard in his evidence-in-chief which I have quoted earlier in this judgment. His Honour summarised the evidence given by Detective-Sergeant Liddiard in cross-examination which I quoted earlier in this judgment, except that in his summary the trial judge did not make any reference to the evidence that Detective-Sergeant Liddiard had later been told that the item was the remote control device for the garage. 

Consideration of grounds of appeal 

66Nguyen's first ground of appeal was that the trial judge erred in determining that the Crown Prosecutor's question in examining Detective-Sergeant Liddiard ""did you find anything similar to a remote control for a garage door?"" was not leading. The trial judge so held in his judgment dismissing the application for a discharge of the jury. On this appeal counsel for the Crown submitted that the question had not been a leading question and, accordingly, the trial judge had not erred. 

67In my opinion, the question was clearly a leading question; it suggested a desired answer that the witness had indeed found something similar to a remote control for a garage door. It was a leading question within the definition of ""leading question"" in part 1 of the dictionary at the end of the Evidence Act, as being a question directly or indirectly suggesting a particular answer to the question. See also Cross on Evidence 7 th Australian Edition paragraph [17150] page 477. The question could not be justified as being merely a question designed to bring the witness's mind to a particular subject matter. 

68However, the question was not objected to and accordingly it was not a question to which the prohibition in s 37 of the Evidence Act, on the asking of leading questions in examination-in-chief, applied (s 37(1)(c)). 

69If the question had been objected to, it should have been rejected. However, the same evidence could have been elicited, without contravening s 37, by the breaking up of the single question into two questions along the lines of ""Did you find anything?"" (and upon receiving an affirmative answer) ""What did you find?"" 

70The first part of Nguyen's second ground of appeal was that the trial judge had erred in admitting opinion evidence; that Detective-Sergeant Liddiard's evidence that the item was similar to, or was, a remote control for a garage door, was evidence of an opinion and inadmissible under Part 3.3 of the Evidence Act . 

71I do not consider that this part of Nguyen's second ground of appeal should be upheld. In my opinion, a submission made by the Crown Prosecutor at the trial was correct. The Crown Prosecutor submitted:- 

""As for it being (submitted to be) expert evidence ... remote control devices, whether they be for televisions or doors or absolutely anything else that one cares to think about these days, it's a common piece of property in the public domain these days"". 

72The identification by a witness of an object as falling within a class of objects commonly encountered by members of the general public in ordinary life is not expert evidence within Part 3.3 of the Evidence Act . No specialised knowledge based on training, study or experience is required in order to be able to give the evidence. 

73In any event, as already noted, the evidence by Detective-Sergeant Liddiard was not objected to. 

74I turn to the second part of Nguyen's second ground of appeal. Detective-Sergeant Liddiard did give two pieces of evidence which were clearly hearsay and did not come within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule of exclusion in the Evidence Act . These pieces of evidence were his evidence-in-chief that ""we were later told of its relevance to this investigation"" and his evidence in cross-examination that ""I was later told that it was the remote for the garage"". 

75As I have already indicated, both pieces of evidence were apparently based on an admission by the appellant Nguyen after his arrest but the Crown accepted at the trial that evidence of the admission would be inadmissible by reason of s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 

76If the evidence had been objected to, it should have been rejected. However, no objection was made by either counsel to either piece of evidence and no application was made by either counsel to have either piece of evidence struck out. Consequently, his Honour could not properly said to have made any error in admitting the evidence, and I would reject the second part of Nguyen's second ground of appeal. 

77I turn now to Nguyen's third ground of appeal and Ta's sole ground of appeal, that the trial miscarried because of the failure or refusal of the trial judge to discharge the jury. 

78Submissions made on behalf of the appellants in support of these grounds of appeal included:- Evidence had been adduced before the jury that the witness had been told that the item in the appellant's car was a remote control device for operating the door to the garage at 14 Tennyson Street. This evidence was inadmissible hearsay. Counsel for the appellants at the trial could not challenge the evidence without running the risk of it emerging that the person who had told the witness this information was the accused Nguyen. There was a risk that the jury would itself infer that the informant had been one of the accused. The evidence was clearly significant in that it was evidence that the appellants were in possession of a device for operating the door to the garage at the premises where the plants were being cultivated, showing a connection between the appellants and the premises which was quite inconsistent with the defence cases. The trial judge did not make any order striking out the evidence and did not direct the jury to disregard the evidence. 

79On the principles to be applied in the determination of a ground of appeal of this kind both counsel for the appellants referred to a passage in the joint judgment of Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ in Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427 at 440-441, stating:- 

""It may be accepted that the Court of Criminal Appeal approached the matter with the correct principles in mind. No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues; the stage at which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact. As the court below acknowledged, much leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading transcript. 

Nevertheless, the duty of the appellate court, where the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge is challenged, is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind. The appellate court must also decide for itself whether, in these circumstances, the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. In other words, can the appellate court say with assurance that, but for the admission of the inadmissible evidence, the conviction was inevitable? ..."" 

80It was submitted by counsel for the appellants that the trial judge made errors in his judgment refusing the application for a discharge, for example in holding that the question asked in evidence-in-chief was not leading. However, the thrust of counsel for the appellants' submissions was that the refusal of the application for a discharge had given rise to a miscarriage of justice. It was accepted by counsel for the appellants that in deciding whether the refusal of the application had given rise to a miscarriage of justice, this Court was not limited to the reasons given by the trial judge for refusing the application. 

81I accept a number of the submissions made by counsel for the appellants, including that the pieces of evidence I have identified were hearsay; that counsel for the appellants at the trial could not challenge the evidence without incurring a risk of the admission by Nguyen emerging before the jury, and that the trial judge did not make any express order that the evidence be struck out and did not given any express direction to the jury to disregard the evidence. 

82I would not accept that there was any real risk that the jury would itself infer that Detective-Sergeant Liddiard's informant had been one of the accused. It was, of course, known to the lawyers at the trial that Detective-Sergeant Liddiard's informant had been one of the accused. However, so far as the jury were concerned, I do not consider that there is any reason to suppose that they would have inferred that the informant might have been one of the accused. It seems to me that, if the jury did give any thought to who the informant might have been, they would have dismissed both of the accused, on the basis that, if the informant had been one of the accused, the Crown would have elicited that fact before them. The jury were unlikely to have had any knowledge of the provisions of s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act . 

83Although I consider that some of the submissions made on behalf of the appellants should be accepted, I have nevertheless concluded that the refusal to discharge the jury did not occasion the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. 

84It is true that the trial judge did not make any express order that the hearsay evidence be struck out or give any express direction to the jury to disregard the hearsay evidence. He was, of course, not asked to do either of these things. However, in my opinion, the way in which the trial was subsequently conducted by both the Crown Prosecutor and the trial judge ensured that the evidence in question was effectively withdrawn from the jury's consideration, without it being highlighted, and that it ceased to have any significance in the trial. 

85Earlier in this judgment I set out part of the Crown Prosecutor's closing address. The Crown Prosecutor referred to the item as ""a"" control device found in the car. He reminded the jury that the item had not been tested. He told the jury ""no one claimed that it was anything other than a remote control device for something"". The Crown Prosecutor submitted to the jury, properly in my opinion, that the jury could find as a circumstance that a remote control device had been found in the car and combine that circumstance with other circumstances that they found in drawing inferences. 

86Earlier in this judgment I set out or referred to parts of the trial judge's summing up. The trial judge summarised Detective-Sergeant Liddiard's evidence as being that he saw a device which he believed was a remote control device. The trial judge told the jury that there was no direct evidence that it was a remote control or a remote control for the garage. His Honour told the jury that the sighting of the item in the car could be combined with other pieces of evidence which his Honour described (which did not include Detective-Sergeant Liddiard's hearsay evidence) in deciding whether the item seen by the police officer was in fact a remote control device giving access to the garage and the house. 

87Later in his summing up the trial judge summarised parts of Detective-Sergeant Liddiard's cross-examination. The trial judge did not include in the summary any reference to the evidence ""I was later told that it was the remote for the garage"". 

88Because of the conclusion I have formed that the evidence in question was effectively withdrawn from the jury's consideration and ceased to have any significance in the trial, the refusal of the trial judge to discharge the jury did not lead to any miscarriage of justice. In these circumstances it is not necessary to consider the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act and, accordingly, it is unnecessary for me to determine whether I myself am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, on the evidence properly before the jury, of the guilt of the two appellants of the offence of which the jury found them guilty. 

89I will, however, observe that in my opinion the case against the appellants was strong. For at least more than an hour on 22 November 2007 both appellants were at the premises 14 Tennyson Street and both the appellants entered the premises. The house at 14 Tennyson Street was almost entirely devoted to the cultivation of a large number of cannabis plants. There was evidence of acts on the part of the appellants showing a connection with the premises, such as the moving of the garbage bin, the putting of papers in the garbage bin and the picking up of the advertising material left in the front yard. 

90Even without the disputed evidence, there was a strong inference available that the appellants in driving in and out of the garage had a remote control device for operating the garage door. In my opinion, it is pure speculation to suppose that a third person within the house operated the garage door for the appellants. 

91In my opinion, all three grounds of appeal of the appellant Nguyen and the sole ground of appeal of the appellant Ta should be rejected and the appeals against conviction should be dismissed. 

The applications for leave to appeal against sentence 

92Both Ta and Nguyen applied for leave to appeal against sentence, in the event of their appeals against conviction being dismissed. In considering these applications it will be convenient to continue to refer to Ta and Nguyen as ""the appellants"". 

93Judge Bennett sentenced each of the appellants to the same sentence, a head sentence of seven years consisting of a non-parole period of four years and a balance of the term of three years. 

94The maximum penalty for an offence of knowingly taking part in the cultivation of not less than the large commercial quantity of cannabis plants is imprisonment for 20 years or a fine of 5,000 penalty units or both. There is a standard non-parole period of ten years for the offence. 

The Remarks on Sentence 

95In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge summarised some of the evidence which had been given at the trial. Neither of the appellants had given evidence in the proceedings on sentence and his Honour made comments about the appellants not having given evidence in the proceedings on sentence. It will be necessary to refer to these comments in some detail in considering one of the grounds of appeal against sentence. 

96Constable Dodd had given evidence at the trial from which, if the evidence was accepted, it could be inferred that the appellants had been at the house at 14 Tennyson Street from about the time that Constable Dodd said he commenced surveillance of the house at 2.30pm. However, the sentencing judge declined to accept this part of Constable Dodd's evidence and made a finding that the two appellants had arrived at the house together at 5.05pm and had, accordingly, been at the house for only a little more than an hour, when they departed from the house at 6.05pm. 

97The sentencing judge referred in his remarks to a number of circumstances which had been established by evidence given at the trial and which the Crown relied on in the proceedings on sentence as being relevant to an assessment of the level of objective seriousness of the offences, including that the appellants had been at 14 Tennyson Street and had actually entered the house, that the house was wholly devoted to the cultivation of more than 500 cannabis plants, that the appellants had had access to the house through an electronically operated garage door and that there was no evidence that on 22 November 2007 the appellants had relieved any one else of the responsibility of caring for the premises or that anyone else had relieved the appellants of that responsibility, when the appellants left the premises. 

98It had been submitted on behalf of the appellants that their role in the cultivation had been limited to that of being merely caretakers of the premises for a short period on one occasion. The sentencing judge rejected this submission finding ""that they (the appellants) occupied a position above the level urged upon me by their counsel"". However, apart from finding that the appellants were ""participants"" in the joint criminal enterprise to cultivate the cannabis plants and stating that he was unable to find that the appellants were ""principals"", the sentencing judge did not further specify what had been ""the position"" of the appellants. 

99The sentencing judge found that the offences of the two appellants were below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. Although his Honour did not expressly say so, it is apparent, when the non-parole period of each sentence is compared with the standard non-parole period, that his Honour found that the objective seriousness of the offences was considerably below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. 

100In the remarks on sentence his Honour summarised the subjective features of the two appellants. 

101Ta was born in Vietnam in 1959. She came to Australia in 1983. She had three children and also cared for another child. At the time of the sentence proceedings three of those children were teenagers and Ta was their sole parent. Ta's only income was Social Security benefits. She lived in accommodation rented at a subsidised rent from the Department of Housing. She had no previous criminal history. 

102Nguyen was born in Vietnam in 1980. he came to Australia in 1994. His parents were divorced in 1995. All the members of his family, apart from his father with whom he had had little contact, lived in Melbourne. He had some limited employment history. He had some previous criminal history but the sentencing judge considered that this previous criminal history was not significant. 

103The sentencing judge found that a number of aggravating factors within s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were present. It will be necessary to refer to this part of his Honour's Remarks on Sentence in more detail later in this judgment, in considering some of the grounds of appeal against sentence. 

104The sentencing judge found that neither appellant had shown remorse and that he could not make a finding in favour of either appellant that the appellant was unlikely to re-offend or had good prospects of rehabilitation. 

105The sentencing judge found special circumstances in favour of Ta, in her being the sole parent of three teenage children, and in favour of Nguyen, in that all members of his family, apart from his father, were living interstate. 

The grounds of appeal 

106The grounds of appeal against sentence were:- 

Ta 

1. The judge erred in the assessment of the role of the applicant in the commission of the offence. 

2. The judge erred in finding that the offence was aggravated by reason of being committed: 

(a) in company; 
(b) without regard for public safety; 
(c) as part of planned and organised criminal activity. 

Nguyen 

1. His Honour erred in finding that the offence was aggravated by reason of it having been committed in company. 

2. His Honour erred in finding that the offence was aggravated by reason of it having been committed with little regard for public safety. 

3. His Honour erred in finding that the offence was aggravated by reason of it having been part of planned or organised criminal activity. 

107It is apparent that Nguyen's three grounds of appeal are substantially the same as Ta's second ground of appeal. I will consider first Ta's first ground of appeal. 

The sentencing judge erred in the assessment of the role of Ta in the commission of the offence. 

108A submission made by counsel for Ta in support of this ground was that in parts of his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge appeared to be treating as the offence for which he was sentencing the appellants, not the offence of knowingly taking part in the cultivation of cannabis plants which was the offence the appellants had been convicted of, but the offence of cultivating cannabis plants which the appellants had been charged with but of which they had, at his Honour's direction, been acquitted. It was further submitted that this focussing by his Honour on the wrong offence had influenced his Honour's assessment of Ta's role and of the objective seriousness of her offence. 

109I accept that there are parts of his Honour's remarks where his Honour describes the offence for which he was sentencing the appellants in language more appropriate to an offence of cultivating than an offence of knowingly taking part in cultivating. However, I consider it unlikely that his Honour, who of course had been the trial judge and who had directed the jury's verdict of not guilty on the charge of cultivating, was mistaken about the offence for which he was sentencing the appellants. In any event, his Honour's assessment of the role of the appellants was based on the circumstances he found had been established, which would have been relevant to sentencing for either an offence of cultivating or an offence of knowingly taking part in a cultivation. 

110Cultivating not less than the (large) commercial quantity of prohibited plants and knowingly taking part in the cultivation of not less that the (large) commercial quantity of prohibited plants are dealt with in the same provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and carry the same maximum penalty. 

111Another submission made in support of this ground of appeal was based on a part of his Honour's remarks on sentence in which his Honour noted that neither appellant had given evidence in the proceedings on sentence, in which his Honour then quoted extracts from the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217 commencing at 227 and from the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50 at 74(64) and in which his Honour then proceeded to make certain findings. 

112Notwithstanding the length of this part of his Honour's remarks, it is desirable to quote it in full. His Honour said: 

""A question arises from the election of the offenders not to give evidence in the proceedings on sentence. As I have noted, the offender Ta gave evidence in the trial but the offender Nguyen did not. There was an explanation that came through one of the police officers however, and as I have already noted it must be that the jury have rejected what they each had to say. 

In Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50 at para 64, the majority of the court explained what was said by Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217 at p 227. 

'There may be cases involving circumstances such that the reasoning in Weissensteiner will justify some comment. However, that will be so only if there is a basis for concluding that, if there are additional facts which would explain or contradict the inference which the prosecution seeks to have the jury draw, and they are facts which (if they exist) would be peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, that a comment on the accused's failure to provide evidence of those facts may be made. The facts which it is suggested could have been, but were not, revealed by evidence from the accused must be additional to those already given in evidence by the witnesses who were called. The fact that the accused could have contradicted evidence already given will not suffice. Mere contradiction would not be evidence of any additional fact. In an accusatorial trial, an accused is not required to explain or contradict matters which are already the subject of evidence at trial. These matters must be assessed by the jury against the requisite standard of proof, without regard to the fact that the accused did not give evidence.' 

The reasoning in Weissensteiner v The Queen to which their Honours in Azzopardi v The Queen referred is found in the following passages commencing at p 227 of the judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in that decision. 

'We have quoted rather more extensively from the cases than would otherwise be necessary in order to show that it has never really been doubted that when a party to litigation fails to accept an opportunity to place before the court evidence of facts within his or her knowledge which, if they exist at all, would explain or contradict the evidence against that party, the court may more readily accept that evidence. It is not just because uncontradicted evidence is easier or safer to accept than contradicted evidence. That is almost a truism. It is because doubts about the reliability of witnesses or about the inferences to be drawn from the evidence may be more readily discounted in the absence of contradictory evidence from a party who might be expected to give or call it. In particular, in a criminal trial, hypotheses consistent with innocence may cease to be rational or reasonable in the absence of evidence to support them when that evidence, if it exists at all, must be within the knowledge of the accused. 

Of course, an accused may have reasons not to give evidence other than that the evidence would not assist his or her case. The jury must bear this in mind in determining whether the prosecution case is strengthened by the failure of the accused to give evidence. Ordinarily it is appropriate for the trial judge to warn the jury accordingly. 

Not every case calls for explanation or contradiction in the form of evidence from the accused. There may be no facts peculiarly within the accused's knowledge. Even if there are facts peculiarly within the accused's knowledge the deficiencies in the prosecution case may be sufficient to account for the accused remaining silent and relying upon the burden of proof cast upon the prosecution. Much depends upon the circumstances of the particular case and a jury should not be invited to take into account the failure of the accused to give evidence unless that failure is clearly capable of assisting them in the evaluation of the evidence before them.' 

Although their Honours in both of those cases were concerned with comment to a jury upon the questions of fact for determination by a jury in a criminal prosecution, the reasoning may be applied to the determination of facts, or the findings of facts that I am required to make for the purposes of the sentencing of these offenders. 

Evidence that might have been offered by the offenders I believe would be as to additional facts, namely, the precise role they had in the conduct of this plantation of cannabis plants. I am of the opinion that I may weigh their election not to give evidence in these proceedings on sentence when considering whether the propositions advanced by the accused's counsel are to be seen as appropriate and whether they are sufficient to displace the inference or inferences for which the Crown contends. 

There is no burden of proof upon the offenders to show that they were mere caretakers for the short period of time that they were seen by the police at these premises. It is for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offenders were more than so in this enterprise. It may do so by way of circumstantial evidence if those circumstances taken together combined with sufficient force to lead to a conclusion as the only rational conclusion in the circumstances that the offenders were more than mere caretakers for a single finite period of time. 

I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that for the reasons advanced by the Crown, drawing together the circumstances upon which the Crown relies, that the only rational inference to draw is that these offenders were participants in the joint criminal enterprise in the pursuit of which those engaged were cultivating by enhanced indoor means the 551 cannabis plants discovered in this house the use of which was solely committed to that endeavour. 

I am unable to find that they were the principals in this organisation. The involvement of another person in the acquisition of the premises suggests at least the possibility, if not the probability, of others with an interest in this endeavour."" 

113It was submitted by counsel for Ta that the sentencing judge had erred in employing the reasoning in Weissensteiner and that the sentencing judge should have determined the facts relevant to sentencing simply in accordance with the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Olbrich v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 270. 

114It is highly unusual for a sentencing judge to refer in remarks on sentence to the decisions of the High Court in Weissensteiner and Azzopardi and to seek to employ a process of reasoning discussed in Weissensteiner on the basis that it has been left open by the later decision of Azzopardi . 

115This process of reasoning is concerned with the acceptance of prosecution evidence and the drawing of inferences in favour of the prosecution on a matter on which the prosecution bears the onus and is to be distinguished from the commonly utilised process of reasoning whereby a sentencing judge, in the absence of evidence from or on behalf of the offender, declines to make a finding in favour of the offender about a matter (for example, remorse) which the offender bears the onus of establishing. 

116It is open to doubt whether the principles, and particularly the constraints, discussed in Weissensteiner and Azzopardi have any application in the sentencing of offenders. As the present sentencing judge himself pointed out, Weissensteiner and Azzopardi were cases on the giving of directions or the making of comments by trial judges to juries in criminal trials. 

117There appears to be a dearth of authority in New South Wales on whether Weissensteiner and Azzopardi (and the related High Court case of RPS v The Queen (2000) 199 CLR 620) have any application to sentence proceedings. 

118In the Queensland case of R v Miller (2003) QCA 404 Holmes J, who delivered the leading judgment with which the other members of the Queensland Court of Appeal agreed, after pointing to various differences between a criminal trial before a jury and a sentence hearing before a judge, said at [27]:- 

""Because of these distinctions, I do not think that the constraints on comment and approach imposed by the Weissensteiner line of authority have any application to fact finding on sentence. There is nothing, in my view, which would constrain a sentencing judge from proceeding, as commensense dictates, more readily to accept prosecution evidence or draw inferences invited by the prosecution in the absence of contradictory evidence"". 

119However, this conclusion by the Queensland Court depended partly on a provision of Queensland legislation which has no counterpart in new South Wales. 

120Ultimately, I have concluded that it is unnecessary for this Court to determine whether Weissensteiner , Azzopardi , and RPS have any application to sentence proceedings. I have reached this conclusion because, although the sentencing judge referred to Weissensteiner and Azzopardi and said that those authorities enabled him to ""weigh"" the appellants' election not to give evidence, his Honour, on my reading of the remarks on sentence, did not ultimately use the failure of the appellants to give evidence for the purpose of strengthening an inference that might, but not necessarily would be, drawn in favour of the Crown, but for the purpose of holding that there was no evidence to ""displace"" the inference in favour of the Crown, which, in his Honour's opinion, was the only rational inference to draw. In other words, the sentencing judge ended up not actually using the process of reasoning referred to in Weissensteiner which might have been left open by Azzopardi. 

121In my opinion, the sentencing judge's assessment of the role of Ta in the commission of the offence was open to his Honour. 

122I would reject Ta's first ground of appeal. 

The trial judge erred in finding that the offence was aggravated by reason of being committed (a) in company (b) without regard for public safety (c) as part of planned and organised criminal activity. 

123As previously noted, this ground of appeal by Ta is substantially the same as Nguyen's three grounds of appeal. 

124The grounds of appeal were based on a part of his Honour's remarks on sentence in which his Honour said:- 

""The relevant aggravating and mitigating factors to be drawn from s 21A subs (2) and subs (3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are as follows. The offence was committed in company. I am also of the view that the offence was one that had little regard for public safety. The increasing burden of the use of cannabis on the community is becoming more obvious to this court. I take that into account as an aggravating factor. The offence was part of planned and organised criminal activity. No other conclusion can be drawn from the nature of these premises, the quantity of the plants and the sophistication of this enterprise."" 

125It was submitted on behalf of the appellants that the sentencing judge was not entitled to take into account as aggravating factors any of these three matters. Counsel for the Crown did not really make any submission to the contrary. 

126It has been established by a series of cases in this Court that a factor should not be taken into account as an aggravating factor to which additional regard can be had in sentencing, if it is either an element of the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an inherent characteristic of that kind of offence. See for example Elyard v R (2006) NSWCCA 43. A factor which is an inherent characteristic of the kind of offence for which the offender is being sentenced can be taken into account as an aggravating factor to which additional regard can be had, only if its nature or extent in the particular case is unusual. 

127In the present case it was submitted on behalf of the appellants, and not disputed by the Crown, that it is an inherent characteristic of an offence of knowingly taking part in the cultivation by enhanced indoor means of not less than the large commercial quantity of cannabis plants, that the offence is committed in company, that the offence is committed without regard for public safety and that the offence is part of a planned or organised criminal activity. 

128The sentencing judge in his remarks did not refer to any matter which would have distinguished the appellants' offences from other offences of this kind. In finding that the offence was committed without regard for public safety his Honour merely referred to the increasing burden on the community of the use of cannabis. In finding the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity his Honour referred to the premises, the quantity of plants and the sophistication of the enterprise. However, it would be impossible for an offence involving the cultivation by enhanced indoor means of not less than the large commercial quantity of cannabis plants to be committed, without there being quite elaborate planning and organisation, including the utilisation of premises and lighting and watering systems. The number of cannabis plants being cultivated was not unusual for a large commercial quantity. 

129It is unnecessary in the present case to discuss some other questions which were mentioned in argument, including the range of offences for which it can be an aggravating factor that the offence was committed ""in company"" and whether it can be an aggravating factor that an offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity, if the particular offender took no part in the devising of the planning or organisation, 

130I would allow Ta's second ground of appeal and Nguyen's three grounds of appeal. 

131Having allowed a ground or grounds of appeal of each appellant, it is necessary for this Court to determine under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act whether some less severe sentence is warranted. In making this determination this Court has to decide whether it would impose a less severe sentence; Baxter v R (2007) 173 A Crim R 284. 

132The objective facts of the offending and the subjective features of the appellants have been set out earlier in this judgment and I will not repeat them. 

133The sentencing judge found that the role of the appellants was higher than that of being mere caretakers of the premises for a short period on one day (a finding which I would accept). However, the only conduct on the part of the appellants actually proved was that they were at the premises at which the plants were being cultivated for a period of just over an hour. 

134I consider that the offence of each of the appellants was very considerably below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of the relevant kind and this is a sufficient reason for departing, and departing substantially, from the standard non-parole period. 

135Like the sentencing judge I would find special circumstances in the circumstances identified by the sentencing judge and I would preserve approximately the same ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence. 

136In my opinion, somewhat lesser sentences than those imposed by the sentencing judge would be warranted and should be imposed. 

137I consider the following orders should be made in the case of each appellant. 

1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 

2. Appeal against sentence allowed. 

3. Quash the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. 

4. In lieu thereof, sentence the appellant to a non-parole period of 3 1/2 years commencing on 27 September 2009 and a balance of the term of 2 1/2 years. The earliest date on which the appellant will be eligible for release on parole will be 26 March 2013.

		09 March 2011",2011-03-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2414009,Alvares v R Farache v R [2011] NSWCCA 33,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL ; I agree with Buddin J. 

2BUDDIN J : These applications for leave to appeal, which were heard together by consent, involve challenges to the sentences imposed upon the applicants in the District Court. Each of the applicants pleaded guilty to various drug offences which were committed in contravention of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). 

3The applicant Alvares stood for sentence in respect of the following offences: 
Count One: Conspiracy to Import Commercial Quantity of a Border Controlled Precursor. 
Between about 7 June 2007 and 25 July 2007 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did conspire with Hassan Farache and Shelton Chowsen and divers others to import a substance, intending to use or believing that another person intended to use, any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug, the substance being a border controlled precursor, namely phenyl-2-propanone (P2P), and the quantity being a commercial quantity. 

Offence on Schedule: Conspiracy to Pre-Traffic a Commercial Quantity of a Border Controlled Precursor. 
Between about 7 June 2007 and 25 July 2007 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did conspire with Hassan Farache and Shelton Chowsen and divers others to pre-traffic in a substance, the substance being a border controlled precursor, namely phenyl-2-propanone (P2P), and the quantity pre-trafficked being a commercial quantity. 

Count Two: Import a Commercial Quantity of Border Controlled Precursor (P2P). 
Between 28 February 2008 and 12 March 2008, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did import a substance, intending to use or believing that another person intended to use, any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug, the substance being a border controlled precursor, namely phenyl-2-propanone,(P2P) and the quantity imported being a commercial quantity. 

Count three: Attempt to Possess Commercial Quantity of Methylamphetamine. 
Between 23 March 2007 and 25 March 2007, in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did attempt to possess a substance, the substance having been unlawfully imported, the substance being a border controlled drug, namely methylamphetamine, and the quantity possessed being a commercial quantity. 

4The applicant Farache stood for sentence in respect of the following offences: 

Count One: Conspiracy to Pre-Traffic a Commercial Quantity of a Border Controlled Precursor. 
Between about 7 June 2007 and 25 July 2007 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did conspire with Richard Alvares and Shelton Chowsen and divers others to pre-traffic in a substance, the substance being a border controlled precursor, namely phenyl-2-propanone (P2P), and the quantity pre-trafficked being a commercial quantity. 

Offence on Schedule: Conspiracy to Import Commercial Quantity of a Border Controlled Precursor. 
Between about 7 June 2007 and 25 July 2007, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did conspire with Richard Alvares and Shelton Chowsen, and divers others to import a substance, intending to use or believing that another person intended to use, any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug, the substance being a border controller precursor, namely phenyl-2-propanone (P2P), and the quantity pre-trafficked being a commercial quantity. 


Count Two: Aid and Abet importation of a Commercial Quantity of Border Controlled Precursor. 
Between 28 February 2008 and 12 March 2008, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere, did aid and abet the importation of a substance, intending to use or believing that another person intended to use, any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug, the substance being a border controlled precursor, namely phenyl-2-propanone, (P2P) and the quantity imported being a commercial quantity. 

5Each of the offences on the indictment, as well as each of the matters on the schedule, attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and/or 5000 penalty units. 

6The applicant Alvares was sentenced in respect of count 3, to 6 years imprisonment to date from 24 April 2008. In respect of count 2, he was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment to date from 24 April 2010. In respect of count 1, and taking into account the matter on the schedule, he was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment to date from 24 April 2012. The effective head sentence was accordingly 12 years imprisonment. His Honour fixed, as he was obliged to do, a single non-parole period of 7 years which will expire on 23 October 2015. 

7The applicant Farache was sentenced in respect of count 2, to 5 years imprisonment to date from 24 July 2008. In respect of count 1, and taking into account the matter on the schedule, he was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment to date from 24 July 2010. The effective head sentence was accordingly 9 years imprisonment and a non-parole period of 5 years, which will expire on 23 January 2014, was fixed. 

8His Honour indicated that the sentences were structured in a manner that gave effect to the principles of totality: see Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. 

9Each of the applicants was arrested and taken into custody on 24 April 2008. As is apparent, the sentence in respect of the applicant Alvares was backdated to that date. However, a later commencement date was selected by his Honour in respect of the applicant Farache to take account of other sentences which he was then serving. On 15 October 2008 he received a sentence of 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 months to date from 24 March 2008 (that is,1 month prior to his arrest for these matters) in the Local Court for offences of goods in custody (consisting of a driver's license) and possession of ammunition without a permit. Those items were discovered by police during the course of executing a search warrant upon the applicant's premises in relation to the present offences. At the same time the applicant was also sentenced in the Local Court in respect of unrelated offences of drive whilst disqualified, have false instrument and possess prohibited weapon. He was sentenced in respect of each of those charges to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months to date from 15 October 2008. On appeal, the non-parole periods in respect of that latter group of offences were reduced to 7 months, the consequence being that that period expired on 14 May 2009. The sentencing judge indicated that it was his intention to commence the sentences for the present matters on 24 October 2008, a date which he selected because it was 7 months from 24 March 2008. Nevertheless, when his Honour passed sentence, he ordered as I have indicated, that the sentences should commence on 24 July 2008. It is apparent that the applicant Farache has inadvertently received the benefit of that 3 month period. 

10The applicant Alvares relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 

1. The sentencing Judge erred by 

(i) failing to assess the unchallenged evidence of the applicant's remorse, 

(ii) applying minimal weight to evidence of the applicant's remorse. 

2. The sentencing Judge erred by applying the 'norm' (the ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence of between 60 and 66%) when no such statutory ratio or formula exists in relation to Commonwealth offences. 

3. The sentencing Judge erred in failing to make a finding as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. 

11The applicant Farache relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 

1. His Honour failed to assess the evidence of the applicant's remorse. 

2. His Honour applied ""limited"" weight to evidence of the remorse. 

3. His Honour erred by applying the 'norm' (the ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence of between 60 and 66%) when no such statutory ratio or formula exists in relation to Commonwealth offences. 

12It will be observed that ground 1 of Alvares' application is in very similar terms to grounds 1 and 2 of Farache's application whilst ground 2 of his application is identical to ground 3 of Farache's application. Accordingly, it will be convenient to deal with each of those grounds together. 

13The relevant factual background to these offences was the subject, in the case of each applicant, of an Agreed Statement of Facts. That material revealed that the investigation into these matters was commenced by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in 2007. In early 2007 the applicant Alvares made arrangements with a man named Oscar Benjamin Munoz Benavente (Munoz) to receive packages from Canada. Alvares told Munoz that the packages had been sent by his cousin and that they would contain racing car parts. Alvares gave Munoz a mobile phone so that he could contact him when the packages arrived. On 23 March 2007 Australian Customs Service intercepted a UPS consigned package which contained household items inside a red box. The box was forensically examined and inside the walls of the box police found white powder which, on analysis, was found to contain 990 grams of methylamphetamine. (This constituted Count 3 of the indictment against the applicant Alvares). 

14In late March 2007 the applicant Alvares phoned Munoz and told him that a package would be arriving soon. Shortly thereafter Munoz took delivery of a package which had been consigned through DHL to an address in Hornsby. Later the same day Munoz delivered a package to Alvares. Customs records indicate that a DHL consignment arrived in Australia on 25 March 2007 and that it had been delivered to the same address in Hornsby as the UPS package that had arrived in Australia on 23 March. The DHL consignment had the same consignor and consignee details as the UPS package. There was no evidence as to what the package contained. In late March 2007 Alvares also asked Munoz to enquire about the UPS package that Customs had intercepted. Munoz made enquiries with UPS using a tracking number provided to him by Alvares. Munoz was told that the consignment had not yet arrived. 

15On 5 April 2007 AFP officers executed a search warrant on the Hornsby address. Munoz was there at the time. During the search police located a piece of paper upon which was the tracking number for the UPS consigned package and a mobile phone. Police examined the SIM card for the mobile phone which showed that a number of text messages had been exchanged between that service and a mobile phone service used by the applicant Alvares. Some of the messages from the phone used by the applicant Alvares made reference to the number "" I gave you "". The UPS consignment tracking number had been sent by SMS from the mobile phone located at the premises to the phone used by the applicant Alvares. 

16During the course of the investigation, police intercepted a number of calls which had been made from various telephone services. Between 11 June and 23 July 2007 the AFP intercepted numerous telephone conversations between the applicant Alvares and the applicant Farache and between the applicant Alvares and a Canadian national identified as Shelton Chowsen. Chowsen is the applicant Alvares' cousin. Those intercepted calls revealed that the applicant Alvares had discussed with both Chowsen and the applicant Farache the importation, concealment and distribution of a number of substances, and their use in the manufacture of other substances. Code words were usually used during the conversations but during a number of the later calls, direct reference was made to a variety of border controlled precursors and drugs, such as ephedrine, P2P, and ""speed"". P2P is a border controlled precursor used in the manufacture of synthetic drugs including methylamphetamine (commonly known as ""speed"") and crystal methylamphetamine (commonly known as ""ice "") and 3,4 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (commonly known as ""ecstasy""). 

17On 26 June 2007 the Australian Customs Service intercepted a UPS consigned package from Canada (the first P2P package). The consignee was nominated as being a Dave Surgen at an address in Waitara. The goods were described as being grape juice. Later that day the applicant Farache contacted the applicant Alvares and asked him to contact him on another number. The phone service which the applicant Farache used was registered in a fictitious name. On 28 June the first P2P package was delivered to the Waitara address. Upon delivery a person named ""Sam"" signed the receipt for the package. It contained about 3 litres of liquid and approximately 2900 grams of pure P2P. 

18The applicant Farache's mobile telephone number was provided as the contact number for the consignee of the first P2P package. The package was received by the applicant Farache either directly from UPS or from a person whom he had arranged to collect it from the courier. The applicant Farache then took the P2P to a clandestine laboratory in northern NSW for the purpose of allowing potential buyers to test the substance and attempt to manufacture a controlled drug. 

19The role of the applicant Farache was to arrange collection of the package from the courier company in Australia and to source buyers. The role of the applicant Alvares, on the other hand, was to facilitate the importation of the package from Canada, although he later became directly involved in attempts to sell the P2P when difficulties arose with potential buyers. 

20It is apparent from the intercepted phone calls, a summary of which was in evidence before the sentencing judge, that during the period of the importation of the first P2P package, the persons to whom the applicant Farache and later the applicant Alvares were endeavouring to sell the P2P, were unsuccessfully attempting to manufacture methylamphetamine from samples of P2P using a process involving the precursor pseudoephedrine. After the first P2P package was received in Australia, the applicant Alvares travelled to Canada. The purpose of his trip was to facilitate or ensure payment to the supplier of the first P2P package. He returned to Australia on the 3 August 2007. (These events gave rise to count 1, and the matter on the Schedule, in respect of each applicant). 

21The applicant Alvares again travelled to Canada on 10 February 2008. He then sent, or was party to an arrangement to send, the second P2P package to Australia. On 28 February this package was consigned through DHL. It contained four wine bottles but was recorded as containing juice. The consignee was nominated as being Michael Tong at an address in Epping. On 29 February Alvares returned to Australia from Canada. On 6 March DHL couriers telephoned Australian Customs Service and expressed concern arising from an attempted delivery of the second P2P package to the Epping address. The package was returned to the DHL bond store and was subsequently seized by customs officers. The package was forensically examined and the bottles were found to contain 3021.2 grams of liquid that, upon further analysis, was determined to be P2P with a purity of between 95.7% and 98.2%. The total pure weight was calculated to be 2924.4 grams. 

22During the weekend of 8-9 March the applicant Farache telephoned DHL and requested that the second P2P package be re-directed to an address in Waitara. A phone number was provided as the contact number for the consignee. On 12 March police conducted a controlled delivery of the second P2P package to the address provided. At the direction of the applicant Farache, a person named Daren Kean accepted delivery of the second P2P package. The applicant Farache was very close by at the time. Kean was arrested, together with the applicant Farache, as they attempted to leave the premises a short time later. When police searched the applicant Farache, they located a mobile phone and SIM card which linked him with the consignment. Police located the package next to the front door of the premises. (These events gave rise to count 2 in respect of each applicant). 

23Later that day, the applicant Farache participated in a recorded interview during which he made some limited admissions. However, both he and Kean were later released without charge. Mobile phones seized from the applicant Farache were found to contain the phone numbers of the applicant Alvares and Kean in their electronic directories. On 24 April a search warrant was executed upon premises at Normanhurst and, as a consequence, the applicant Alvares was arrested. He declined to participate in an interview with police. A number of mobile phones were seized from his premises. Text messages, which were sent from a Canadian telephone service, and which were recorded on one of the phones which was found at his home, revealed that he was concerned about the possibility of being detected by the authorities. Call charge records for the phone services operated by the applicant Alvares revealed that he had been in very frequent contact with Chowsen in the week leading up to 24 April. The applicant Farache was also arrested and charged the same day. 

24The total quantity of P2P seized from both packages was approximately six litres containing 5.8 kilograms of pure P2P. The wholesale value of the P2P is estimated to be in the vicinity of AUD $300,000. 

25The sentencing judge described the applicant Alvares' background in the following terms: 

The offender has no prior convictions. 

In addition there is a body of other character evidence. Testimonials note that the offender is a person who has a strong work ethic and a person of good character. One character statement refers to the offender having access to prescribed drugs in his work as a wardsman and that he has shown that he could be trusted in that environment. 

Prior good character is of less significance in cases involving substantial trafficking in drugs. 

The offender Alvares was born and raised in the Sydney suburb of Auburn. He has one brother 25. His parents immigrated to Australia from India in 1981. The parents moved to Normanhurst in 1995 and he resided there until the time of his arrest. 

The offender described his parents as strict and hardworking. However he said that there was much conflict between his parents and they frequently argued. He told the psychologist Michelle Player that his parent's tumultuous relationship had an adverse impact on the family and that he felt increasingly angry and distressed at his parents for their behaviour. 

The offender told the psychologist that his parents frequently struck him with a belt as a form of discipline. The offender said that his father became increasingly paranoid and that he had been diagnosed as suffering from a psychotic condition, possibly schizophrenia. His father has been taking anti-psychotic medication however he is frequently non-compliant. 

The offender said that as he grew older he increasingly avoided spending time at the family home and he often stayed away with friends. 

The offender reported a strong relationship with his brother. 

The offender reported behavioural difficulties in primary school. He told the psychologist that when he was in year three a teacher suspected he suffered from ADHD and subsequent medical assessment supported such a diagnosis. The offender said that his mother did not want him to commence a course of medication. The offender however said that he did not experience behavioural difficulties in high school and ultimately completed his Higher School Certificate. 

The offender completed a TAFE accredited Certificate III course in retail operations. He has been employed as a wardsman since he was sixteen years old. Additionally he held a second position in publishing operations at Fairfax Publications. He was working multiple shifts in both occupations prior to his arrest. 

The offender has not been engaged in any significant relationships. He reported that the majority of his friendships have been longstanding and that his peers are ""pro-social"". 


26His Honour described the applicant Farache's background in the following terms: 

The offender who was born in Lebanon arrived in Australia with his family when he was five years old. He is one of seven children. Both the offender's parents are pensioners. 

The offender's family are supportive of him. There is no other history of criminality in the offender's family. 

The offender completed year twelve in High School. The offender described himself as an average student. Following high school the offender completed a Certificate II course in Information Technology before commencing an apprenticeship as a tiler in 2005. He was in his third year of that apprenticeship when he was incarcerated. 

The offender did not exhibit behavioural problems at school. 

The offender has not been in any long-term relationship and, at the time of the offending, he was residing with his parents. 

The offender told the psychologist [Sam Borenstein] that he commenced drinking soon after he left high school. He admitted to binge drinking and then, in 2006, he said that he commenced what was described as ""recreational"" use of cannabis. The offender said that after fracturing his arm and then losing his job he became depressed and then resorted to drugs. He said that he had ""lost hope"". 

He told the psychologist that in the period leading up to the charges his judgment was poor. He said that he experienced a degree of paranoia particularly from use of cannabis and the drug 'ice'. 

Courts have recognised that drug addiction of itself cannot be a mitigating factor. The fact of drug abuse does not generally deprive the crime of any of its seriousness, nor enable other than a custodial sentence to be imposed when the seriousness of the crime so demands. 

The fact that an offence occurs in the context of drug abuse may however need to be taken into account as a factor relevant to the objective criminality of the offence. It may throw light on matters such as the impulsivity of the offence and the extent of any planning for it and the state of mind or capacity of the offender to exercise judgment. 

It may provide an explanation for the commission of the offence or place the offence in context but it is not to be considered as a factor for the reduction of what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence for the nature of the offences committed. 

Drug abuse, whilst clearly not a mitigating factor, may be relevant as a subjective circumstance in so far as the origin and extent of the addiction, and any attempts to overcome it might impact upon the prosects of recidivism and rehabilitation. 

The psychologist expresses the view that the offender ""appears to have been caught up in a hopeless cycle of addiction "". He went on to say that the offender ""impressed as a rather naive young man "" and that ""...[the offender] appears to lack assertion. His demeanour is more submissive, particularly so with regards to his obligations to his family "". 

Further (at 8.8) ""Mr Farache suffered depression coinciding with escalation of drug usage and a fracture to his left arm. Mr Farache had lost hope. He feared his arm would not recover."" 

Here the offender's drug use may provide the background to the offender's involvement. Having considered the nature of his acts and particularly the content of the intercepted calls it could not be said that the offender's judgment was significantly impaired at the time of the offending. The offender's drug abuse history is however relevant to the assessment of the offender's prospects of rehabilitation. 

27I referred earlier to the fact that the applicant Farache had a criminal record. In fact he had previously been dealt with for a variety of traffic offences, including on two prior occasions for driving whilst disqualified. 

28In approaching his sentencing task, his Honour correctly acknowledged that he was required to have regard to the matters set out in s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Act) and in particular to ss (1) which requires a court to impose a sentence that is ""of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence"". His Honour then dealt with those matters identified in ss (2) of the Act which he considered to be relevant to the sentencing task. His Honour also made the following observations: 

The proper approach to sentencing involves the weighing of all relevant factors in order to reach a conclusion that a particular penalty should be imposed. The court should avoid taking a mathematical approach , as this would depart from principle because it does not take into account that there are many conflicting and contradictory elements that bear upon sentencing an offender: Markarian v The Queen (2005) 215 ALR 213. 

The task of the sentencer therefore is to take account of all the relevant factors and to arrive at a single result which takes due account of them all. The task is to arrive at an ""instinctive synthesis"": Wong and Leung v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584. 

I am of the view that taking into account the objective seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. (emphasis added) 

29In order to make a proper assessment of the objective gravity of the offences which had been committed by each of the applicants, the sentencing judge made various findings as to their respective roles. This was a matter upon which his Honour had received detailed submissions from the parties, both orally and in writing. His Honour had regard not only to that material but also to the Agreed Statement of Facts and to the document which provided summaries of the various intercepted calls commencing on 11 June 2007. 

30Upon the basis of that material his Honour reached the following conclusions: 

A sentencing judge, in considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon an offender who was involved in a criminal enterprise with others, should if able, ascertain the position the offender held in order to determine the degree of culpability. 

Factors that may differentiate between particular offenders in an enterprise involving prohibited drugs include the offender's knowledge about the extent of the enterprise, the offender's role in the enterprise, the duration of their involvement and the reward which the offender hoped to gain from participation. 

Difficulties may however arise when a court attempts to categorise the role of the offender in the criminal enterprise. Difficulties arise, as the sentencing court is unlikely to know the full nature and extent of the roles of particular offenders within the enterprise. The application of labels such as ""principal"" or ""middle order"" may obscure the assessment of what the offender did leading to an erroneous sentencing process: see R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, [19]. 
... 

Fact finding in the present matters can become an extremely complicated and misleading task if one moves in pursuit of labels. This was the danger referred to in Olbrich. The present case reflects the futility in such a pursuit. 

This is not a case where there can be a direct comparison of the roles of each of the offenders. The difference in the nature of the charges brought against each offender in relation to the same importation represents the difference in the way the roles of the offenders are to be viewed. 

This is a matter where the sentencing of the offenders should proceed upon a consideration of what it is that each of the offenders did in relation to the separate counts and the matter on the schedule. 

In that regard the statement of agreed facts and the summaries of the intercepted calls enable the court to accurately determine the separate acts of the offenders relating to each P2P package. 
... 

I am of the view that there is little to distinguish the culpability of each of the offenders here in relation to the P2P offences though I am ultimately of the view that the level of culpability is marginally higher in the case of Alvares. This difference in the level of culpability will be reflected in the ultimate sentences imposed. 

I have considered the summaries of the intercepted calls paying particular attention to the content of the calls in the context of the movement of the packages. In my view the calls indicate that there was a difference in the roles however the difference was based on a division of labour and not upon different levels of operation within the criminal enterprise. 

I am of the view further that it is futile to attempt to determine whether there was someone in Canada who could be said to be operating at a higher level. The genesis of the operation cannot be determined with any precision. What can be determined with precision is that both offenders were involved in various stages of the processes of bringing in two packages of P2P with the intention of disposing the P2P for financial gain. Further that the roles of each of the offenders was important to the success of the enterprise and of achieving the aims of the enterprise. 
... 

The involvement of the offenders in the enterprise here are somewhat perplexing. There is nothing in their backgrounds to explain how it is that they decided to become involved in such significant acts of criminality. It is apparent however that their acts were unsophisticated and amateurish. The offenders had no clear knowledge of what it was they were dealing in though they were aware of its potential use. 

The offenders were very young at the time of the offending. Mr Alvares was 20-21 years old at the time. Mr Farache was 22 or 23 at the time of the offending. This may to some extent provide some understanding of their decision to act in the way they did. 

The offences are objectively serious. They call for a strong element of deterrence. As is clear from the document tendered headed ""Quantities and values of drugs and Precursors"" the quantity of prohibited drugs, which could have been produced from the precursor P2P, was significant. The precursor had the potential to cause significant harm to the Australian community. 

Further, in relation to the count of Attempt to Possess Marketable Quantity of Methylamphetamine against the offender Alvares, the quantity of drug involved was also significant and again a strong element of deterrence is called for. 



Grounds of Appeal 
Ground 1 (i) and (ii) (Alvares) 
Grounds 1 and 2 (Farache) 

31To place this ground of appeal into context, it will be necessary to have regard to what assessment the sentencing judge made of the material which had been placed before him upon the issue of remorse. 

32In relation to the applicant Alvares, the sentencing judge made the following observations: 

The report of the psychologist notes that the offender expressed regret for his offending stating that his actions were ""stupid"". The report goes on to say (at para 19 ): 

Since being incarcerated and associating with ex-methamphetamine users for allegedly the first time, Mr Alvares offered he had become aware of the significant destructive effects of this drug. He told me he regretted his involvement in procuring an ingredient for manufacturing methylamphetamine now that he had realised what harm methamphetamine use was causing to the person using it, to the victims of drug-related crimes, and to the community as a whole. 

The authors of a number of testimonials tendered have maintained contact with the offender since he has been in custody and have observed that the offender is remorseful for his acts. The offender did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence and I am unable to make my own assessments (sic) as to the extent of the offender's remorse. 

The Crown has conceded that the unilateral indication of pleas to the P2P charges by Alvares is indicative of some level of more than token contrition, particularly since the case against him in relation to the second importation of P2P was not so strong as the other cases against him or as the cases against Farache. (emphasis added) 


33His Honour then went to consider the question of the applicant's ""willingness to facilitate the course of justice"": Cameron v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 339. His Honour determined that the applicant was entitled to a discount in the order of 15% for this factor. 

34In relation to the applicant Farache, the sentencing judge made the following observations: 

The offender's sister said, having had regular contact with the offender since he entered into custody, that the offender has expressed remorse. She said that he was very sorry for the anguish that he put his family through particularly as his mother is of poor health. She said that was sorry for what he had done and that he acknowledged that he needed help. 

The offender told the psychologist that he felt foolish in agreeing to Alvares' request and that he feels guilty and responsible and a deep sense of shame for his actions. 

The report notes that the offender ""expressed guilt and remorse with regards to learning the drugs for which he is charged would have eventually ended upon the street to create harm, in a way drugs have impacted on his life"". 

The psychologist notes that the offender ""...spontaneously expressed genuine guilt and remorse with regards the offence. He expressed a deep sense of shame for his behaviour and how it has impacted on his family and others."" 

The offender did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence and I cannot make my own assessment of the strength of his remorse. I however take into account the offender's expressions of remorse in a limited way. 

The Crown case in relation to the first P2P was however a strong one. The strength of the case in count two largely however was based upon an admission by Mr Farache that he possessed and was the sole user of the telephone used in conversations which implicated him in the offending. (emphasis added) 

35In his case, his Honour allowed a discount of 10% for his ""willingness to facilitate the course of justice"". 

36Because it is germane to the topic under consideration, his Honour's observations concerning the material that had been placed before the court on behalf of the applicants as to their offending conduct are set out below. 

The account of the offending given by Alvares: 
The offender did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. The offender however gave an account to the psychologist Michele Player. 

Caution should be exercised in attaching weight to histories given during the course of preparation of reports when the histories given have not been tested. 


The offender told the psychologist that he knew his actions were illegal and ""that it was drug related"". The report notes (at para 17) that the offender ""... naively stated he had not realised the seriousness of his criminal behaviour and that he had not considered the consequences of his actions. "" 

The report goes on to refer to the following history provided by the offender: 

[The offender] reported he had been experiencing greater than usual family stress around the time the offences were committed. In addition to ongoing parental conflict he was exposed to at home, Mr Alvares advised that his brother lost employment due to an allegation of sexual assault for which he was later cleared of wrongdoing. He stated that he was highly distressed about his brother's predicament and was concerned for his mental stability, as it would appear his brother was depressed and expressed suicidal ideation. Mr Alvares affirmed he received monetary payments for his involvement in the offences. He stated the extra money alleviated some of his financial distress resulting from his problematic gambling behaviour. 

The account of the offending given by Farache: 
The offender Farache also did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence . He told the psychologist Sam Borenstein that at the time he had a "" bad drug habit and a drug debt"" and ""pretty much got caught up in it "". He said that he was in the habit of borrowing money from Alvares and owed him $2,500. He said that after he had obtained monies from Alvares he would then purchase drugs from a local drug dealer. 

The offender said that he was using about two to four grams per day including as much as 4 grams methamphetamine per week. He estimated that he was spending between $1000 and $1500 per week on drugs. The offender said that he found it difficult to work after an accident and began to manifest symptoms of depression including loss of weight, reduced motivation, poor sleep and worry. 

Farache told the psychologist that Alvares told him to make a phone call and direct a parcel to his home "" to clear the debt "" owed. He said that Alvares was putting some pressure on him to pay back the monies he owed. 

He said that his drug use escalated to chronic levels and that "" his life became consumed and pre-occupied by where and how he would receive drugs "". 

The offender told the psychologist that he admitted making a phone call to have the package redirected and that he had some discussions about drugs with Alvares on the phone. He said that those conversations were ""... just plain questions, I don't know if he was trying to get knowledge from me or something "". He said he now feels foolish for agreeing to Alvares' request. 

The report notes that the offender said, "" ...during the period of binges and leading up to the charges, his judgment was poor. He experienced a degree of paranoia, particularly marijuana and crystal methamphetamine (sic) . 
... 
The Crown submits that, absent evidence from the offender Farache, little weight should be given the history provided by the offender as to his role particularly when what he says is significantly at odds with the statement of facts and what can be discerned from the telephone calls. (emphasis added) 


37The main burden for advancing the arguments in relation to the present ground was assumed by counsel for the applicant Farache. Counsel for the applicant Alvares was largely content to adopt those submissions. The challenge centred upon those passages from his Honour's Remarks on Sentence which I have highlighted. 

38In considering this aspect of the matter, the sentencing judge recognised that he was bound to consider s 16A(2)(f) of the Act. The Act provides that ""[I]n addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court ... (f) the degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence"". (emphasis added) Although the statute uses the expression ""contrition"", both the sentencing judge and counsel appearing at first instance and in this court used that expression and the term ""remorse"" interchangeably. I do not detect any meaningful distinction between the two expressions but, for the sake of consistency, will employ the term ""remorse"". 

39A convenient starting point in considering this ground are the principles, which have been distilled by the High Court, that describe the nature of the task confronting a sentencing judge and how it ought to be approached. 

40In The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, a majority of the court said: 

Courts of criminal appeal in Australia have considered the subject of fact finding for sentencing many times in the last thirty years. Not all of the questions that have been examined in those decisions must be considered now. For present purposes, it is enough to say that we reject the contention that a judge who is not satisfied of some matter urged in a plea on behalf of an offender must, nevertheless, sentence the offender on a basis that accepts the accuracy of that contention unless the prosecution proves the contrary beyond reasonable doubt. The incongruities that would result if this submission were accepted are well illustrated by the present case. The respondent swore that he was a courier but the judge disbelieved him. To require the judge to sentence the respondent on the basis that he was a courier is incongruous. 

Much of the discussion of fact finding for the purposes of 
sentencing addresses questions of onus and standard of proof. 
References to onus of proof in the context of sentencing would 
mislead if they were understood as suggesting that some general issue is joined between prosecution and offender in sentencing proceedings; there is no such joinder of issue. Nonetheless, it may be accepted that if the prosecution seeks to have the sentencing judge take a matter into account in passing sentence it will be for the prosecution to bring that matter to the attention of the judge and, if necessary, call evidence about it. Similarly, it will be for the offender who seeks to bring a matter to the attention of the judge to do so and, again, if necessary, call evidence about it. ( We say ""if necessary"" because the calling of evidence would be required only if the asserted fact was controverted or if the judge was not prepared to act on the assertion ). 

As to the standard of proof that should be applied, we would adopt 
what was said by the majority in R v Storey (30) - that a sentencing judge 

""may not take facts into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the accused unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are circumstances which the judge proposes to take into account in favour of the accused, it is enough if those circumstances are proved on the balance of probabilities."" [at paras 24-5, 27] (emphasis added) 


41In Weininger v The Queen (2003) 212 CLR 629, a majority of the court said: 

...The use of the phrase ``known to the court'', rather than ``proved in evidence'', or some equivalent expression, suggests strongly that s 16A was not intended to require the formal proof of matters before they could be taken into account in sentencing. Rather, having been enacted against a background of well-known and long-established procedures in sentencing hearings, in which much of the material placed before a sentencing judge is not proved by admissible evidence, the phrase ``known to the court'' should not be construed as imposing a universal requirement that matters urged in sentencing hearings be either formally proved or admitted. 

In addition to the points just made about what is known to the 
sentencing judge, there is another important feature of fact finding in sentencing which must be recognised. Many matters that must be taken into account in fixing a sentence are matters whose proper characterisation may lie somewhere along a line between two extremes. That is inevitably so. The matters that must be taken into account in sentencing an offender include many matters of and concerning human behaviour. It is, therefore, to invite error to present every question for a sentencer who is assessing a matter which is to be taken into account as a choice between extremes, one classified as aggravating and the opposite extreme classified as mitigating. Neither human behaviour, nor fixing of sentences is so simple. 

Further, a sentencing hearing is not an inquisition into all that may 
bear upon the circumstances of the offence or matters personal to the offender. Some matters may be fixed by the plea or verdict of guilty although, even there, there may be ambiguities (as for example, in some homicide cases where a verdict of manslaughter is returned). Many of the matters relevant to fixing a sentence are matters which either the prosecution or the offender will draw to the attention of the sentencing judge. Some matters will remain unknown to the sentencing judge. The question then becomes, what use is the sentencing judge to make of what is known, and of the matters urged by the parties? This is not just a series of choices for the judge between alternatives. Not only may some things be unknown, some will concern matters in which a range of answers may be open. 

As was pointed out in Storey, it is important to avoid 
introducing ``excessive subtlety and refinement'' to the task of 
sentencing. That object is advanced if sentencing and appellate courts pay close attention to identifying those matters that the sentencing judge takes into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the accused, and those matters that the sentencing judge takes into account in favour of the accused. It must be recognised that not every matter urged on the judge who is to pass sentence has to be, or can be, fitted into one or other category. The judge may be unpersuaded of matters urged in mitigation or in aggravation. The absence of persuasion about a fact in mitigation is not the equivalent of persuasion of the opposite fact in aggravation. So to conclude would ignore the different 
standards of proof that are to be applied. It would also be wrong 
because it would assume that human behaviour can always be 
described as a dichotomy. It cannot. Human behaviour and characteristics are more varied than that. Further, it would be wrong because it would assume that sentencing is a syllogistic process. It is not. It is a synthesis of competing features which attempts to translate the complexity of the human condition and human behaviour to the mathematics of units of punishment usually expressed in time or money. [at paras 22-24] 


42In GAS v The Queen (2004) 217 CLR 198, the Court, in the context of discussing a plea agreement which had been reached between the parties, observed: 

Thirdly, it is for the sentencing judge, alone, to decide the sentence to be imposed. For that purpose, the judge must find the relevant facts. In the case of a plea of guilty, any facts beyond what is necessarily involved as an element of the offence must be proved by evidence, or admitted formally (as in an agreed statement of facts), or informally (as occurred in the present case by a statement of facts from the bar table which was not contradicted). There may be significant limitations as to the judge's capacity to find potentially relevant facts in a given case. ... 

Fourthly, as a corollary to the third principle, there may be an understanding, between the prosecution and the defence, as to evidence that will be led, or admissions that will be made, but that does not bind the judge, except in the practical sense that the judge's capacity to find facts will be affected by the evidence and the admissions. In deciding the sentence, the judge must apply to the facts as found the relevant law and sentencing principles. It is for the judge, assisted by the submissions of counsel, to decide and apply the law. There may be an understanding between counsel as to the submissions of law that they will make, but that does not bind the judge in any sense. The judge's responsibility to find and apply the law is not circumscribed by the conduct of counsel. [paras 30-31] 

43It may also be noted that the rules of evidence only apply to sentence proceedings if the court makes a direction to that effect: Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) s 4(2). 

44The issue which presently falls to be considered arose because each of the applicants was endeavouring to persuade the sentencing judge, with a view to ameliorating the otherwise appropriate sentence, that he was remorseful, and genuinely so. Remorse in this context means regret for the wrongdoing which the offender's actions have caused because it can be safely assumed that an offender will always regret the fact that he or she has been apprehended. Remorse is but one feature of post-offence conduct upon which an offender may seek to rely as a matter which has the potential to mitigate penalty. The manner in which the issue of remorse is approached is not unique to either the sentencing process or to the courtroom. Indeed, it is a common feature of everyday existence. Ordinary human experience would suggest that it is only natural that a person who has committed some misdeed would wish to make the most favourable impression possible in seeking to make amends for it. It is unsurprising that such a person would also wish to maximise the prospect that his or her expression of remorse was seen as genuine by the person or persons whose task it was to determine the appropriate sanction for the misdeed. Such an outcome is likely to be assessed as having increased prospects if the expression of remorse, whether it be by deed or word, is communicated directly, rather than indirectly to those responsible for determining the sanction. By the same token, an assessment of the genuiness of the remorse by the person or persons to whom it is expressed, is likely to be better informed in circumstances in which it is expressed directly, that is face to face. That is because remorse is an intrinsically subjective matter, the evaluation of which depends upon the subtleties of human interaction. 

45It has also been recognised that the issue of remorse may be interconnected with other features of an offender's subjective case. In Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ approved the statement made by Gleeson CJ in R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 in which his Honour said: 

It must often be the case that an offender's conduct in pleading guilty, his expressions of contrition, his willingness to co-operate with the authorities, and the personal risks to which he thereby exposes himself, will form a complex of inter-related considerations, and an attempt to separate out one or more of those considerations will not only be artificial and contrived, but will also be illogical. [at 228] 

46It is common ground that the sentencing judge did give some, albeit limited, weight to the evidence which had been adduced about the applicant's remorse. When distilled to its essence, the submission which was advanced was that the sentencing judge erred in giving it only limited weight. It was contended that the material before the sentencing judge required that substantial weight should have been afforded to the evidence. Such a submission falls to be considered in the light of what was said by Spigelman CJ in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85. His Honour observed: 

Questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge. The circumstances in which matters of ""weight"" will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined. [at para 11] 

47In my view, the applicants have failed to demonstrate that his Honour fell into error. Putting the matter another way, his Honour's findings were plainly open to him in light of the material (to which his Honour made specific reference) that had been adduced at the sentence hearing. It is also important to recall the precise terms of the statutory provision with which his Honour was concerned. In my view, his Honour's reasoning is unimpeachable for the very reasons which he identified, namely that it was very difficult for him to assess the extent to which the applicants were genuinely remorseful for their conduct when they had not expressed it to him directly and thereby exposed themselves to being tested upon the issue. That would be a sufficient basis, in itself, upon which to determine this ground. 

48Nevertheless, in deference to the lengthy submissions which were advanced by counsel, both orally and in writing, it will be necessary to consider the issues which were raised in some greater detail. It was accepted by counsel that questions of whether or not remorse has been demonstrated, and indeed the extent of any such remorse, were matters entirely within the sentencing judge's discretion. Nonetheless, it was submitted that the sentencing judge ""failed to engage in his own assessment of the weight of the applicant's remorse"" because, so it was put, he must have felt constrained by statements from this court to which reference will be made shortly. Counsel acknowledged that, given that there was no express reference by his Honour to such authorities, it had to be inferred that his Honour had felt so constrained. The inference was founded, as counsel recognised in oral argument, upon his Honour's use of the expression ""cannot"" in the passage from the Remarks on Sentence which I highlighted earlier. I pause to indicate that I would not interpret the remarks in that fashion. In my view, his Honour was saying no more than that he was unable, given the nature and source of the evidence which had been adduced upon the issue, to make an assessment of the extent of the remorse. Indeed, his Honour specifically used the word ""unable"" when considering this issue in respect of the applicant Alvares. As I have already said however, his Honour did accept the evidence that was before him, such as it was, and indeed gave it some weight. It may well be that his Honour's conclusions were in conformity with the consistent statements from this court to the effect that caution is to be applied in approaching the question of the weight that is to be attributed to hearsay material. That hardly suggests, of itself, that his Honour was in error. On the contrary, it rather indicates, in my view, that his Honour's approach was fundamentally sound. 

49It is now convenient to refer to the authorities to which counsel directed the court's attention. In R v Qutami (2001) 127 A Crim R 369 in which Smart AJ, with whom Simpson J agreed, said: 

There is one further general observation. In this case reliance appears to have been placed on statements made by the prisoner to psychiatrists and the psychologist. While those statements are admissible in evidence, very considerable caution should be exercised in relying upon them when there is no evidence given by the prisoner. In many cases only very limited weight can be given to such statements. 


There has been a noticeable and disturbing tendency of more recent years for prisoners on a sentence hearing not to give evidence and to rely on statements made to experts. Prisoners should realise that if this course is taken great caution will be exercised in respect of the weight, if any, given to those statements. (paras 58-9) 

50Spigelman CJ said: 

I agree with the observations of Smart AJ as to the limited weight that ought to be given to self-serving, untested statements made to experts which are tendered in sentencing hearings. (para 79) 

51Subsequently in R v McGourty [2002] NSWCCA 335, Wood CJ at CL, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said: 

So far as I can see, there was no factual basis for the finding made by his Honour beyond a self-serving and untested statement made by the respondent to a psychologist. Recently this Court has criticised the practice of placing material of this kind before sentencing judges, in an attempt to minimise the objective seriousness of a crime otherwise apparent on the face of a record: Regina v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353, at paras 58 and 59 per Smart AJ, and at para 79 per Spigelman CJ). 

I whole heartedly agree with the criticism offered in that case. If an offender appearing for sentence wishes to place evidence before the court which is designed to minimise his/her criminality, then it should be done directly and in a form which can be tested. (paras 24-5) 

52There are many other decisions to similar effect. See, for example, R v Tulloh (Court of Criminal Appeal, (NSW) 16 September 1993 unreported at 4); R v Niketic [2002] NSWCCA 425; R v Hooper [2004] NSWCCA 10; R v Alameddine [2004] NSWCCA 286. 

53It was submitted that those statements were prescriptive in nature and were thus likely to be applied in a fashion which effectively placed a fetter upon the exercise of a sentencing judge's discretion. It was also submitted that no statutory foundation for the statements was to be found in s 16A(2) of the Act. Although in written submissions, counsel had contended that those decisions were wrongly decided, that submission was not pressed in oral argument. Rather, it was argued that they did not apply to Commonwealth offences or in circumstances in which no objection was raised to the evidence being given. 

54Since counsel placed considerable reliance upon this court's decision in R v Elfar [2003] NSWCCA 358, it is necessary at this stage to consider its significance. That case involved a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence that had been imposed upon a young man who had pleaded to having been involved in a large-scale conspiracy to ""re-birth"" stolen vehicles in order that they could be sold overseas. The respondent's father was a co-conspirator. The sentencing judge had before him a pre-sentence report, two psychological reports and a letter addressed to him from the respondent. Much of that material was directed to highlighting the influence which the respondent's father exerted over him and to the violence which he had exacted upon him. It also contained assertions that the respondent's father had forced his son to assist him in his criminal activities. The sentencing judge accepted that the respondent's ""criminal activity was due to the duress of his father"". The sentencing judge apparently accepted, without reservation, the accounts recorded in the material which had been placed before him, notwithstanding the fact that the respondent had not given sworn evidence. 

55The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge had erred in accepting two major components of the respondent's case solely on the basis of hearsay material. Whealy J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said: 

There is, however, a problem for the Crown in relation to the first submission. The Crown was represented throughout the sentence hearing. The transcript records that, when the hearsay material was tendered, there was no objection taken to it. There was no qualification expressed as to the way in which the sentencing judge might use the material. The Crown did not, at any time suggest that there was any dispute as to the assertion that the respondent had been, in effect, coerced into the criminal enterprise by the force of his father's personality and his position as family leader. Nor was there any dispute raised with the proposition that the respondent had expressed remorse and contrition on a number of occasions in relation to his involvement in these serious criminal activities. Moreover, at one stage, the solicitor appearing for the offender indicated her willingness to call the offender's grandmother to give evidence of her observations of the behaviour of the offender's father towards him. The respondent's grandmother was then present in court with an interpreter available to translate her evidence. His Honour, however, indicated that, for his part, he did not require to hear from the witness in view of the material in the statements. More importantly, the Crown made no demur to the proposition that the sentencing judge might accept the statements in the material before him, without hearing direct evidence on the issue. Additionally, the Crown did not express any wish to test the available witness in cross-examination on any matter relating to the issue. 

While sentencing judges are required in general to act with caution and employ a sound level of judicial scepticism when confronted with statements in reports or other material which are not supported by an offender's evidence, I do not think it is open to the Crown to complain of appellable error in this court if its representative in the court below has not plainly taken up a disputant position, either when the material was tendered or when submissions were made. This is even more so when, as here, the Crown had raised no objection whatsoever and made no submissions in opposition to the documentary material or its hearsay contents. 

In some situations, the evidence placed before a sentencing court will be so inconsistent, so contrary to common sense and the agreed facts that, even without Crown intervention, adverse submission or opposition, it will be quite apparent to the sentencing judge that little or no weight should be given to the material. The duty of the sentencing judge will be plain in such a situation. There will be a need for the sentencing judge to inform the parties of his preliminary attitude to the tendered material and to invite submissions and provide the opportunity for further evidence. Absent satisfaction, the judge will be entitled to, and should exercise considerable caution in placing reliance on the material. In many cases, only very limited weight, if any, will be given to the material. When, as happened here, however, there was a consistent body of coherent credible evidence, admittedly of a hearsay kind, supporting the existence of genuine exculpatory factors, it will be necessary for the Crown to state that it disputes the position revealed in that material and to say why that is so. 

In this regard this case was perhaps an unusual one. This was so because of the consistent nature of the material and its inherent credibility. Nevertheless, there was not one suggestion made that the sentencing judge should reject the material, or treat it as of little value because of the absence of direct evidence from the respondent. If the Crown wished to take an adverse position in that regard during the sentence hearing it needed to do so clearly and explicitly. 

Because of the Crown's failure to take that position in the rather unusual circumstances of this matter; and because of its tacit acceptance that the sentencing judge might reliably act on that material, there is, in my view, no substance in the first point of the argument. [paras 27-31] (emphasis added) 

56The applicant relied upon his Honour's observations as providing support for the proposition that since the Crown in the present case had not raised any objection to the tender of the material (or at least not to the material concerning the issue of remorse), or made any submission that it should be approached with caution, then that material should not only have been accepted but should have been afforded substantial weight. Moreover, it was submitted that the decision made it clear that a sentencing judge is under a duty as a matter of procedural fairness, to put a party on notice especially where the evidence is uncontested, as to any preliminary view about the weight to be given to particular material which he or she may have formed. That was necessary, so it was submitted, to enable the parties to consider their positions and so that they could proceed with the benefit of that indication. Support was also, it was submitted, to be found in the underlined passage from Olbrich (supra) to which reference was made earlier. 

57I am unable to accept that his Honour's observations should be construed in that fashion. His Honour was not, as I read the judgment, seeking to lay down rules of general application. In my view, what his Honour said was utterly uncontroversial in the context of deciding that particular case. It is important to reiterate that Elfar (supra) involved a Crown appeal and, as Whealy J was at pains to point out, the Crown sought on appeal to impugn findings of fact that were based on material to which no objection had been taken at first instance. Furthermore, his Honour described the case as an ""unusual one"" and referred to the ""consistent nature of the material and its inherent credibility"". There was, as I read the judgment, statements from other family members to the effect that the respondent had indeed been afraid of his father and that he had previously made unsuccessful attempts to leave home and cease working for his father. There was also reference to the fact that the respondent's father had previously served a minimum term of 4 years imprisonment for a very similar offence. Moreover in a passage to which the Court's attention was not drawn, his Honour went on to say: 

The matters of principle stated in R v McGourty and R v Qutami are plainly important. They require emphatic endorsement by this court. Indeed it needs also to be further emphasised that this principle extends not only to statements in psychological reports, but also to statements by offenders in pre-sentence reports - ( R v Palu per Howie J with whom Levine J and Heydon J (sic) agreed (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at 185). In addition, the current practice of tendering a note or letter from an offender in sentencing proceedings attracts the same admonishment. Considerable caution should be exercised in reliance upon such exculpatory material where there is a matter in dispute and where no evidence is given by an offender or other direct evidence is not placed before the court. The essential reason for treating the material in that way is precisely because it remains untested. Indeed, where the Crown has either objected to the tender of this type of material or has made it clear, either at the time of tender or when submissions are made, little or no weight should be placed upon the material, that the sentencing court would be entitled to treat the material as being of little or no weight. Indeed, in an appropriate case, it ought to do so. [at para 25] 

58Not only does the court in Elfar make clear its ""emphatic endorsement"" for the principles expressed in Qutami (supra) and McGourty (supra) but nowhere in the judgment is there to be found any support for the proposition that in the absence of objection to material adduced on behalf of an offender, evidence of remorse must be afforded substantial weight. Nor is there any support for it in Olbrich (supra). At one stage it was submitted that this court had, in effect, created a principle that has been interpreted, particularly in the District and Local Courts, as having the consequence that an offender cannot get a meaningful benefit for remorse unless he or she gives sworn evidence. It is not easy to reconcile that submission with the approach taken by this Court in determining the Crown appeal in Elfar itself. Nevertheless, circumstances may arise in which it will be prudent for a sentencing judge to remind the parties during the course of a sentence hearing of what was said by this court in Qutami (supra). 

59Counsel also sought to draw comfort from the fact that there is a contrast between the Commonwealth provision dealing with remorse and the equivalent provision under State legislation. Section 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 lists the mitigating factors which are to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence. That list includes: 

(i) the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if 

(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and 

(ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both). 

60Counsel relied upon this court's decision in Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1 as support for the proposition that even that provision does not require the offender to give evidence. 

61Fullerton J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said: 

The applicant submitted, and correctly, that the prosecutor misstated the law when he submitted that s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires an offender who is claiming the benefit of remorse in mitigation of sentence to give evidence in the sentence proceedings, and that in the absence of such evidence little weight ought attach to out of court statements of remorse by the offender. Contrary to the prosecutor's submission there is no statutory requirement that an offender give evidence before remorse can be taken into account in the calculation of sentence. Furthermore, the prosecutor's reliance on R v Thomas [2007] NSWCCA 269 as authority for the proposition he advanced was in error. 

On a proper construction, s 21A(3)(i) requires an offender to provide evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or any reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both), as a statutory precondition to any reliance on remorse as a mitigating factor. The requirement to provide evidence before remorse can be relied upon does not equate with a requirement that an offender give evidence either of remorse generally or of the matters set out in the section. This much is clear from Thomas at [18]-[19] per Basten JA: 

""18 The other evidence of remorse is recorded in a report dated 13 December 2006, prepared by a psychologist, Mr Peter Ashkar. Mr Ashkar reported: 

""He accepts responsibility for the ... offence. He tells me he was heavily intoxicated on bourbon when he committed this offence. ... He also tells me he was in the company of antisocial peers at this time. He attributes his offending behaviour to his alcohol use at that time. 

Matthew expresses considerable regret and remorse over his offending behaviour: 'I was definitely in the wrong ... I'm sorry ... I do feel bad for doing it ... I've learnt my lesson ... Never to get in trouble again ... It's just not worth it'."" 

19 The failure of Mr Thomas to give evidence to that effect himself in the witness box; his continued adherence, through many days of hearing, to an implausible story which was disbelieved, but constituted a significant attempt to diminish his responsibility for the offence, and the fact that he committed a further serious offence less than a month later, all require consideration in assessing the genuineness of remorse and the extent to which his expression of remorse can mitigate an otherwise appropriate sentence. A finding of genuine remorse should not be made lightly, especially in circumstances where there are contra-indications. A sentencing judge should indicate the manner in which he or she has taken into account the possibility that expressions of regret may be triggered by the threat of incarceration. On the other hand, it is fair to say in the present case that his Honour accepted the genuineness of his attempts to overcome abuse of alcohol which would provide a basis for the conclusion that there was a genuine attempt to address an underlying cause of the violent behaviour."" [at paras 16-17] 


62Although counsel did not refer to it, it is instructive to record what her Honour then went on to say, because her observations are apposite to the present case: 

18 In the present case the statutory precondition in s 21A(3)(i) was satisfied in any event. There was ample evidence in the tendered material that the applicant accepted responsibility for his actions and acknowledged the very significant injury suffered by victim as a result of his actions. However, as is clear from the remarks on sentence..., his Honour did not disregard the evidence bearing upon remorse because the applicant did not go into the witness box and give evidence. Rather he considered that in assessing the weight of evidence of remorse, sourcing as it did solely from the tendered material, he was entitled to take into account the fact that the applicant did not give evidence. This was a course properly open to him. It is an approach that is consistent with this Court cautioning against an uncritical reliance on material contained in tendered reports (or other third party statements) for evidentiary purposes where an offender has not given evidence (see R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; 127 A Crim R 369 and TS v R [2007] NSWCCA 194 at [30]). 


63That said, I do not accept that the fact that the State and Commonwealth legislation is cast in different terms has any significance so far as the application of the statements made in Qutami (supra) is concerned. 

64It was submitted that a further reason why the evidence before the sentencing judge should have been afforded substantial weight was because there were no ""contra-indications of remorse"". I understand that expression to mean that there was nothing in the evidence which was inconsistent with the evidence of remorse. However, the applicant Farache told the psychologist Sam Borenstein, in relation to his involvement in these offences, that it was ""pretty much nothing"". He appeared to attribute his involvement to the fact that he owed money to the applicant Alvares for drugs and that he was thus beholden to him. Moreover, when he was first interviewed by police he denied knowledge of the contents of the consignment. In light of that material, it was well open to the sentencing judge to accept the Crown's submission that ""little weight should be given to the history provided by [the applicant Farache] as to his role particularly when what he says is significantly at odds with the statement of facts and what can be discerned from the phone calls"". None of those considerations suggest that the applicant Farache was prepared to accept complete responsibility for his actions. Accordingly, I would not be prepared to accept the proposition that there were ""no contra-indications of remorse"", at least so far as the applicant Farache is concerned. 

65As I have said the determination of questions of fact, such as the extent to which remorse has been shown, is quintessentially a task that falls to the sentencing judge. Indeed, a sentencing judge is not bound to accept assertions by an offender that he is remorseful, even when that assertion is made in the witness box: R v Stafrace (1997) 96 A Crim R 452. Nor will what Simpson J described, in Pham v R [2010] NSWCCA 208 [at para 33], as ""the often ritual incantation of remorse and contrition"" be automatically accepted by a sentencing judge. 

66It is important to emphasise that the court was not taken to any decision in which it has been authoritatively stated that an offender will only be entitled to the benefit of a finding of remorse in the event that he or she gives sworn evidence to that effect. Indeed it would be surprising if there was any such authority because it is readily apparent that an offender may, in some circumstances, demonstrate remorse by either words or conduct without giving sworn evidence. It may emerge, for example, from a confession which is made by an offender to police in a recorded interview about his or her involvement in an offence. Indeed, on occasions a court is requested to view the electronic recording of such an interview, or parts thereof, because it clearly demonstrates the offender's remorse at a point in time which is much closer to the commission of the offence than the sentence hearing. Such an exercise may well assume added significance should the offender have gone further and provided assistance to the authorities. Alternatively, an offender, who is racked with guilt, may come forward and disclose his or her involvement in an offence of which the authorities may otherwise be completely unaware: R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. 

67There are other types of conduct on the part of an offender which may well also be indicative of remorse. It may consist, for example, of making reparation to the victim of a crime which entails a loss of money. Alternatively, an offender having committed a crime, may ring and request assistance from the police and/or emergency services. Those calls are usually recorded and sometimes provide very clear evidence of the offender's remorse. Nevertheless, I recognise that there is the potential for this consideration to overlap with what is sometimes referred to as ""post-crime ameliorative conduct"". Such a situation may arise, for example, where an offender makes an emergency call which has the effect of saving someone's life: see Thewlis v R (2008) 186 A Crim R 279. 

68Finally, it was submitted that the logical consequence of the pronouncements of this court in Qutami (supra) would result in making sentence proceedings in the District and Local Courts ""unworkable"". So far as that submission is concerned, I would respectfully adopt what Fullerton J said in Butters (supra). Her Honour observed: 

The applicant's counsel advanced the submission that if uncontested evidence of remorse from third party sources is to be accompanied in every case by evidence from an offender confirming its genuineness, the efficient, and at times the necessarily informal dispatch of sentence matters in the District Court would be compromised. Efficiency is always a laudable objective. It should not, however, take precedence over the application of sentencing principles, in this case a principle enshrined in s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the application of which has been authoritatively determined by this Court in Thomas . [at para 19] 

69I would reject this Ground of Appeal. 

Ground 2 (Alvares) 
Ground 3 (Farache) 

70Counsel for the applicant Alvares assumed the main burden for advancing the submissions in respect of this ground. They were adopted by counsel for the applicant Farache. Counsel pointed out that the non-parole period which was imposed by the sentencing judge in respect of the applicant Alvares was 62.5% of the effective head sentence, whilst in the case of the applicant Farache, it was 61.11% of the effective head sentence. It was submitted that it could be inferred that in fixing those periods, the sentencing judge had accepted the submissions which had been made on behalf of the parties at the sentence hearing. It is convenient to now refer to those submissions. 

71Counsel who appeared for the applicant Alvares during the sentence proceedings made the following submission: 

The last matter on which I'm going to address the court, your Honour, is the proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence. I've handed up the case of Bermier, (sic) your Honour, and in that judgment the court refers to consideration being given to the individual facts of the case. Whilst it might normally be the case that the ordinary proportion in Commonwealth matters between the non-parole period and the head sentence is somewhere in the range of 60 percent to 66 percent it's not a case where there's a mathematical or rigid approach. It requires an assessment and sometimes circumstances may exist which would permit a court to move outside the usual range. 

In this matter, Mr Alvares' matter there are five circumstances which do permit the court to move outside of the usual range... 
(Counsel then outlined those matters). 

72Counsel who appeared for the applicant Farache submitted that ""so far as the non-parole period is concerned, your Honour knows very well what the normal range is for cases like this and I would submit this is a case that should fit within the normal range"". 

73The Crown, for its part, made the following submission: 

The Court of Criminal Appeal has said that it is generally appropriate for the ratio of the non-parole period to head sentence, duly adjusted having regard to all relevant subjective factors, to be approximately 60 per cent to 66 per cent. 

74The consequence, it was submitted, was that the sentencing judge had fallen into error of the kind identified by the High Court in Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 272 ALR 465. 

75That case involved an application for special leave from a decision of this court allowing a Crown appeal in respect of various sentences which had been imposed under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) . A majority of the court (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) concluded that: 

[t]hese are reasons enough to conclude that there neither is, nor should be, a judicially determined norm or starting point (whether expressed as a percentage of the head sentence, or otherwise) for the period of imprisonment that a federal offender should actually serve in prison before release on a recognizance release order. More particularly, these are reasons enough to conclude that it is wrong to say, as the Court of Criminal Appeal did, ""that the 'norm' for a period of mandatory imprisonment under the Commonwealth legislation is between 60 and 66%, which figure will be affected by special circumstances applicable to a particular offender"". It is wrong to begin from some assumed starting point and then seek to identify ""special circumstances"". Rather, a sentencing judge should determine the length of sentence to be served before a recognizance release order takes effect by reference to, and application of, the principles identified by this Court in Power, Deakin and Bugmy. [at para 44] 

76In reaching that conclusion, their Honours observed that: 

[t]he proposition stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in this matter: ""that the 'norm' for a period of mandatory imprisonment under the Commonwealth legislation is between 60 and 66%, which figure will be affected by special circumstances applicable to a particular offender"" should not be accepted. Its error is revealed by consideration of two points: the first point is a general proposition about references to a ""norm""; the second comprises a set of more specific propositions drawn from what was said by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Ruha. 

First, any reference to a ""norm"" for non-parole periods for federal offences is, at the very least, apt to mislead. Reference to a ""norm"" is ambiguous. It does not reveal whether the proposition is prescriptive or descriptive. That is, is the ""norm"" that is identified a statement of what ought to be, or is it an observation of what has been done in past cases? If it is the former, what is its statutory root? As the earlier description of the applicable statutory provisions shows, there is none. Is it a proposition of universal application, or are there exceptions? Apparently there are exceptions: in ""special circumstances"". What are ""special circumstances""? What is the source of these exceptions? None was identified. If reference to a ""norm"" is intended as a compendious description of what has been done in other cases, what are those other cases? Why are they useful comparators? Is the historical description of what has been done intended to guide what should be done thereafter? What is the principle that will tell a sentencing judge when or how the ""norm"" should be applied? 

Even if the ambiguities inherent in references to a ""norm"" were to be resolved, references to a ""norm"" will necessarily mislead if they distract attention from the applicable statutory provisions: Pt IB of the Crimes Act. They will mislead if they suggest that the same kind of sentencing outcome will generally be expected in the sentencing of any federal offender. That is, they will mislead if they are read as saying that the same proportionate relationship should (or should normally) exist, between the time that is to be served in prison and the length of the head sentence imposed, in relation to all federal offences, no matter whether the offender has defrauded the Commonwealth, has been knowingly concerned in the importation of prohibited imports, or has committed some other federal offence. They will mislead if they suggest that matters such as the absence of prior convictions, or the willingness to co-operate with authorities, can have no effect on fixing a non-parole period, or time to be served before a recognizance release order takes effect, greater than a stated small percentage of the head sentence. They will mislead if they suggest that the offender must demonstrate some special circumstance to warrant departure from a set, mathematically calculated, relationship between the time to be served in custody and the head sentence. [paras 36-8] 


77In the final analysis, the High Court decided that notwithstanding the fact that this court had erred in its approach, it had nonetheless ""sufficiently revealed why the sentences were manifestly inadequate [and that the applicants had not demonstrated] that, if proper principles had been applied, any lesser sentence should have been passed by the Court of Criminal appeal on either applicant"". [at para 14]. 

78I would reject this ground of appeal for the simple reason that the sentencing judge did not say anything which might suggest that he had fallen into error of the kind identified in Hili and Jones (supra). First, his Honour did not, as counsel had urged, refer to a 'norm', or 'a range', or a 'starting point'. Nor, as counsel for the applicants concede, did the sentencing judge make any reference to those submissions. Indeed, if his Honour had pursued the course for which counsel for the applicants at first instance contended, then he may very well have fallen into error of the very kind identified by the High Court. Nor would I accept the submission that merely because the non-parole period which was imposed fell between 60% and 66%, it was to be inferred that his Honour had, in effect, placed a fetter upon the exercise of his discretion. I referred earlier to his Honour's exposition of the various principles which he applied in exercising his sentencing discretion. He was aware, for example, of the need to avoid taking a ""mathematical approach"" to the task. I am not persuaded that his Honour, when setting the non-parole period, did anything other than have proper regard to the various features of the case in arriving at what he regarded as being the minimum period which the applicants must spend in custody. Moreover, his Honour's approach appears to be entirely consistent with what the High Court said in Hili and Jones (supra) in which it was observed that: 

[t]he Court of Appeal in Ruha examined what considerations bear upon fixing the length of a pre-release period under a recognizance release order. As the Court of Appeal rightly said, s 16A(1) and (2) ""make it plain that all of the circumstances, including the matters in the non-inclusive list in s 16A(2), must be taken into account in making recognizance release orders just as they must be taken into account in imposing a sentence of imprisonment"". In determining what recognizance release order is made, s 16A(1) requires the sentencing court to ""make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence"". What is the ""severity appropriate"" is determined having regard to the general principles identified by this court in Power v R, Deakin v R and Bugmy v R. [para 40] (footnotes omitted) 

79I would reject this Ground of Appeal. 

Ground 3 (Alvares) 

80In complaining that the sentencing judge had erred in failing to find that the applicant Alvares had ""good prospects of rehabilitation"", counsel sought to link this ground with ground 2. The sentencing judge dealt with the issue of the applicant Alvares' prospects of rehabilitation in the following fashion: 

Prospects of rehabilitation Alvares 
The offender has had a good prior work history and expressed confidence in easily securing employment upon his release. 

The offender told the psychologist that he has discontinued association with his co-offenders. 

The psychologist did not detect any underlying behavioural conditions which would significantly impede rehabilitation. 

The offender reported binge alcohol consumption on weekends from the age of seventeen. He however told the psychologist that his use had not increased over time. In the twelve months prior to his arrest he had consumed cocaine however there is nothing in the report to suggest that there was any causal link between his alcohol and drug taking and the offending for which he faces sentence here. The offender has commenced a drug and alcohol program course at Parklea Gaol. 

The psychologist notes that the offender reported problematic gambling behaviour from a young age. The offender stated that he would gamble most of his wages. Risk assessment of the offender placed him ""...at the lower end of the problem gambling range and indicates that the offender may require professional assistance."" (para 16) 

Testing carried out by the psychologist suggests that the offender is placed within the average range of cognitive ability. 

The psychologist suggests that against a background of exposure to family conflict the offender has displayed a history of poor coping responses to stressful periods in his life, such as gambling drug and alcohol use and other impulsive behaviours described as a ""maladaptive coping strategy"". The offender reported experiencing significant levels of stress, mainly about his brother's welfare at the time the offences were committed. The psychologist expresses the view that the offender's difficulty coping with this stressful period may have contributed to his poor choice to become involved in criminal activity (at para 25). 

The offender has the support of his family and has no criminal antecedents. He has a good history of education and employment. 

A number of testimonials have been tendered. There are a number of common themes. All vouch for his good character and express shock at becoming aware of the nature of the present charges. It is clear that there is a level of support for the offender in the community. 

The psychologist suggests that the offender would benefit from supervision when he is released. That supervision would address the offender's ""underlying impulse disorder that has led to previous problematic gambling and substance abuse."" (at para 27). Supervision would include counselling directed at relapse prevention. 

The psychologist comments that there is a risk of the offender continuing to be exposed to antisocial influences in custody (at para 28). It is suggested that the sentence should ""tend to maximise the period under supervision in the community"". 

81So far as the applicant Farache is concerned, the sentencing judge undertook a similar review of his prospects before concluding that: 

the offender faces a significant period in custody which is likely to have a significant deterrent effect upon him. He also has significant support in the community. I am of the view that with appropriate supervision upon his release the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. 

82It was submitted that his Honour erred in not making a similar finding in respect of the applicant Alvares, particularly as his prospects of rehabilitation were stronger than those of the applicant Farache. In that respect, it was observed that the applicant Alvares was the younger of the two and, unlike his co-offender, had no prior criminal record. True it is that his Honour made no express finding about this aspect of the matter. However, it can be readily inferred that his Honour did form the opinion that the applicant had ""good prospects of rehabilitation"". Accordingly, in my view his Honour's failure to refer to it, in terms, was simply an oversight. It is almost impossible to imagine that his Honour's extensive review of the material set out under the heading ""Prospects of Rehabilitation"", which I reproduced a little earlier, can have served any purpose other than to provide the basis for a positive finding in relation to his rehabilitation prospects. Moreover, the fact that his circumstances are at least equivalent to, if indeed not more favourable than those of the applicant Farache, serves only to confirm that impression. Finally, the fact that his Honour had earlier found that there was some evidence that the applicant was remorseful, is another indication that his Honour believed that the applicant had ""good prospects of rehabilitation"". 

83As this court said in R v MAK (2006) 167 A Crim R 159: 

Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act...requires the sentencing court to take into account specifically, as matters in mitigation of sentence, not only the plea of guilty but also that the offender is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation. In respect of the last two matters it is clear that remorse will be a major factor in determining whether those matters of mitigation exist: without true remorse it is difficult to see how either finding could be made. [at 169] 

84I would reject this Ground of Appeal. 

Conclusion 
85There were, as his Honour indicated, some important subjective features to be weighed in favour of each of the applicants. Nonetheless, the objective gravity of the offences for which the applicants stood to be sentenced, was very significant. Each faced sentence in respect of a series of serious drug offences, in the commission of which, they had each performed a prominent role over a not inconsiderable period of time. 

86That leads me to conclude that even if, contrary to the conclusions which I have reached in dealing with the grounds of appeal, error had been established, I would not be prepared to conclude that a lesser sentence was warranted and ought to have been imposed: s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It may be observed that neither applicant complained that the sentences which had been imposed were manifestly excessive. 

87I propose in each case that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 

88SCHMIDT J : I agree with Buddin J.

2414304,Wade v R [2011] NSWDC 206,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: This is an appeal against the severity of sentences passed by Magistrate Degnan sitting in the Local Court at Campbelltown on 24 February 2011. His Honour delivered written remarks on sentence which are the best I have seen from any magistrate in the five years that I have been sitting in crime. To outline the background of the appeal, it is necessary for me to cite some of what his Honour said. Commencing at [3] his Honour said this: 

""3. The offender was employed as a Corrections Officer since 2002. In 2009, he was based at the John Moroney Correctional Centre ... 

4. On 20 November 2009, the offender met Sara Davis at the Shell Service Station in Berkshire Park, where he received cannabis leaf to smuggle to inmate, Benjamin Maule in the John Moroney Correctional Centre. The offender also received $300 cash from Davis for the performance of the illegal service ... 

5. On 25 November 2009 the offender met Adriana Obierzynski at the same Shell Service Station, where he received a Polo brand top and a CD of downloaded songs to smuggle to her brother, inmate, Zachary Obierzynski in the John Moroney Correctional Centre. The offender also received $300 cash from Adriana Obierzynski for the performance of the illegal service ... 

6. On 25 January 2010, the offender met Michael Holland at Holland's residence, where he received some cannabis leaf, vodka in a water bottle and some tablets to smuggle to inmate Jared Tidsley in the John Moroney Correctional Centre. The offender also received $300 cash from Holland for the performance of the illegal service ... Later the same day, the offender was arrested as he was about to enter the John Moroney Correctional Centre. When searched he was found to be in possession of the cannabis leaf, the vodka and a few tablets. Police also recovered $510 from the offender's vehicle. When later interviewed by police, the offender conceded the meeting with Holland, but claimed he was smuggling the cannabis leaf under duress and that rather than smuggle it into the prison, he was going to alert the prison's Executive Officers of the true situation. In the same interview, he denied receiving any money from Holland, or having previously smuggled prohibited drugs into the prison. 

7. On 26 February 2010, the offender was called to give evidence before the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Despite a declaration that he must tell the truth, the offender lied in his testimony by: 

Falsely claiming he was acting under duress, including the receipt of threatening letters from inmates; 
falsely claiming he did not receive any cash from Adriana Obierzynski; 
falsely claiming to have met Sara Davis to discuss a home loan: Davis was employed by Bankwest; and 
falsely claiming he was intending, on 25 January 2010, to surrender to the prison Governor, the cannabis leaf, the vodka and the tablets found in his possession. 

8. On 28 April 2010, having been shown the surveillance evidence, the offender confessed to [the] ICAC that he had lied on 26 February 2010. 

9. The offender has no previous criminal history."" 

2His Honour accepted that the appellant had pleaded guilty to each of the charges which he faced at the earliest available opportunity. His Honour accordingly allowed a discount of twenty - five per cent of the proper sentences to be passed upon the appellant. In [28] of his reasons, his Honour set out the following table of the offences and the head sentences: 

""1. Supply prohibited drug on 25 January 2009, eight months. 

2. Corruptly receive benefit on 25 January 2009, sixteen months. 

3. Corruptly receive benefit on 20 November 2009, sixteen months. 

4. Corruptly receive benefit on 25 November 09, sixteen months. 

5. Give false evidence to the ICAC multiplied by four, twenty months."" 

In the next paragraph his Honour applied the twenty - five per cent discount, such that the sentences became: 

""1. Supply prohibited drug on 25 January 09, six months. 

2. Corruptly receive benefit on 25 January 09, twelve months. 

3. Corruptly receive benefit on 20 November 2009, twelve months. 

4. Corruptly receive benefit on 25 November 09, twelve months. 

5. Give false evidence to the ICAC multiplied by four, fifteen months."" 

3There is one mathematical sentencing error in his Honour's reasons. Having found that the appropriate head sentence for the four counts of giving false evidence to the ICAC was fifteen months, his Honour then sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for those offences for sixteen months. That error needs to be corrected. 

4A submission was put to the learned Magistrate by learned Counsel for the appellant about extra curial punishment. In [24] of his reasons his Honour said this: 

""Counsel for the offender additionally made submissions to the Court on the further mitigating factors of extra curial punishment, and the impact of a sentence on his eight year old daughter. There is no issue the offender has lost his career with Corrective Services. Any further involvement in the administration of justice would be untenable considering the commission of offences that intentionally and flagrantly interfered with the administration of justice. In the circumstances of this case, I find that the loss of the offender's career should be afforded no weight."" 

5In the next paragraph his Honour went on to point out that the general principle of hardship to the family and the offender's dependents is generally not applicable unless there are truly exceptional circumstances and there were no truly exceptional circumstances in the current matter. 

6There is no exception taken to what his Honour said about hardship to the offender's child. However, it has been submitted on this appeal that his Honour erred in failing to take into account the loss by the appellant of his career in the Department of Corrective Services because of his misconduct in office. 

7I am told some background of the appellant's working life in the Pre - Sentence Report. The appellant attended Colo High School to Year Ten when he obtained the School Certificate. He then entered into an apprenticeship as a pastry cook and part of his apprenticeship involved attending Ryde TAFE. When he completed his apprenticeship he obtained a certificate of proficiency as a pastry cook. The appellant was then continuously employed in the baking industry until he joined the Department of Corrective Services in 2002. The appellant held that position for the best part of eight years, before his employment was terminated due to the matters for which the appellant stood for sentence. 

8The appellant, in fact, became a Senior Prison Officer, and at the time he was charged with the matters for which he stood for sentence, he was responsible for a small number of inmates working in the Industries Section at the John Moroney Correctional Centre. After his services as a Corrections Officer were terminated, the appellant returned to his trade working as a baker at Katoomba, and was so working at the time that the sentence hearing was conducted. The appellant told the Acting - Director of the Windsor District Office of the Probation and Parole Service that he was then earning $850 per week as a baker at Katoomba and that his weekly outgoings on his mortgage, his car loan, and child maintenance amounted to approximately $645 per week. He, accordingly, was left with $205 per week to provide for his sustenance and other outgoings. 

9I have been told, without objection from the Bar table, that as a Senior Prison Officer, the appellant had been earning $76,000 per annum, which is approximately $1461.50 per week, which gave him a net income of around $1000 per week. The appellant clearly has suffered financial disadvantage because of losing his job. However, he has lost more than a job. He has lost a career with prospects of advancing in the Department of Corrective Services to, for example, becoming a commissioned Corrective Services Officer. 

10He has also, because of his misconduct and his deceit, lost any opportunity of ever obtaining employment again in the New South Wales Public Service and I dare say in the Federal Public Service, and lost any prospect in the future of obtaining any position where trust and integrity is required. The offender, by his conduct, has greatly narrowed his employment opportunities. 

11The question is, is this extra curial punishment, and ought it to have been acknowledged by the learned Magistrate? In my view, the answer to each of those questions is, yes. The reasons given by the learned Magistrate for not taking into account the loss of the offender's career seem to me to indicate that his reasoning was that because the offender abused his office as a Senior Prison Officer, he had only himself to blame for the loss of his career and, therefore, it should be afforded no weight. If that were the learned Magistrate's reasoning process, then it is inconsistent with authority. 

12In R v Richards (1982) 2 Cr App Reps 119, the Court of Appeal considered an appeal against a sentence passed upon a medical practitioner. Richards had been a general practitioner in Bristol since 1956. He obtained moneys by deception, to which he was not properly entitled, from the Avon Area Health Authority by submitting false claims for payment. The local equivalent of that offence would be a medical practitioner making a false claim for reimbursement from Medicare. The total amount obtained improperly by Richards was £ 222. The Lord Chief Justice pointed out that as the offender was paying income tax, the net profit to the offender, and the net loss to the public purse, was ""not very considerable"". 

13One of the reasons that the Court of Appeal took into account in reducing the sentence was the following consideration: 

""The appalling consequences which face a professional man in these circumstances, it is suggested, were not sufficiently realised or taken into account by the Judge. It is obvious that the appellant will have to face the Disciplinary Committee of the General Medical Council and it is not difficult to guess what the result of that appearance must inevitably be. It is, in short, the end of this man's career, and at the age of 57 or 58, it will not be possible for him to work his way back into practice in the way that a younger man could do."" 

In Richards the offender had abused his position as a Medical Practitioner to obtain a financial benefit for himself. In so doing, he had taken a step which would end his career as a medical practitioner. Nevertheless, the English Court of Appeal, comprising the Lord Chief Justice, and Mr Justice Griffith and Mr Justice Webster, believed that it was a factor to be taken into account in mitigation that the offender would, by his own misconduct, lose his career as a medical practitioner. 
14In the ""Sentencing Manual"" compiled by Mr Ivan Potas, and published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales in 2001, the author says in Chapter 6 Part 5C at page 305 this: 

""Financial loss may be a mitigating factor where it relates to a permanent loss of livelihood consequent upon imprisonment."" 

However, the author does not cite any authority for that proposition but does cite authority for associated principles. 

15One of the authorities cited to me by Mr Russell is R v Stanley and Spindler (1981) 3 Cr App Reps 373. In that case Stanley was a Colour Sergeant in the Cheshire Regiment, having joined the British Army in 1961. He had given false evidence on a driving charge before the Chester Magistrates. He pleaded guilty at the Crown Court to a charge of perjury. He was sentenced to imprisonment for three months. The judgment of the Court of Appeal (Watkins LJ, Park and Taylor JJ) was given by Park J, who said: 

""It is quite plain from the documents before this Court, that if the sentence of imprisonment is allowed to stand, then Stanley will be discharged from the Army. The consequence would be that he would lose an Army pension estimated at £ 60 a week, which he would otherwise have enjoyed for the remainder of his life. That penalty would be so serious a consequence of this offence that, in our judgment, this appellant ought not to be required to suffer it, serious though the offence of perjury is."" 

16The Court set aside the sentence of three months imprisonment and substituted a bond to be of good behaviour for two years. In that case, it was not that that the offender's livelihood was completely destroyed, but rather that he would lose his accumulated pension rights. In the current matter it is accepted that the appellant would lose all the employer contributions made by the State of New South Wales to his superannuation because of the circumstances in which his services were terminated, which could be a major financial impost. 

17Australian case law also supports the decision of the English Court of Appeal in R v Stanley and Spindler . In Lancaster and Touhy (1991) 58 A Crim R 209, it was pointed out that in sentencing members of the Armed Forces sufficient weight must be given to the fact that custodial penalties will result in discharge from the Army. In addition to that, such offenders would lose their pension rights and they may well have no qualifications for trained work in civilian life. 

18Here, of course, the appellant does have qualifications for trained work in civilian life, but it is a relevant fact to take into account that a member of the Armed Forces might lose his career. Equally there are a large number of cases pointing out the difficulties faced by former members of the Police Force who not only lose their careers on committing crime, but may also lose pension benefits and retirement gratuities as well as being subject to harassment when in custody. The latter fact, of course, also applies to former Corrective Service Officers and was certainly taken into account by Magistrate Degnan in the current case. 

19However, the appellant has suffered, in my view, extra curial punishment which must be taken into account. He has lost his career, he has lost any comparable career. He is certainly financially disadvantaged and that should be taken into account. 

20I was asked by learned Counsel for the appellant to reduce the effect of non - parole period from eighteen months to twelve months, and it must follow that there must be a consequent reduction in the overall head sentence. That fixed by the learned Magistrate was effectively twenty - eight months, but because of the mathematical error, that should have been twenty - seven months. I have come to the view that I should reduce both the head sentence and the non - parole period by three months to account for the extra curial punishment which was not acknowledged by the learned Magistrate. The only thing that remains for me to do is to re - sentence the appellant, who was granted bail at the commencement of this appeal. 

[FURTHER SUBMISSIONS] 

21HIS HONOUR: For those reasons, I allow the appeal. I set aside the sentences passed by the Local Court at Campbelltown on 24 February 2011. 

22Sebastian Wade, on each of the charges of supplying a prohibited drug on 25 January 2010, and corruptly obtaining a benefit on 25 January 2010, I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non - parole period of six months commencing on 15 April 2011 and expiring on 14 October 2011. I impose a further period of imprisonment of six months to commence upon the expiration of the non - parole period and expiring on 14 April 2012. The total sentence is therefore one year, comprising the non - parole and the balance of the sentence. I have found special circumstances. You are to be released to parole at the expiration of the non - parole period. 

23For the offence of corruptly receiving a benefit on 20 November 2009, I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non - parole period of six months commencing on 15 July 2011 and expiring on 14 January 2012. I impose a further period of imprisonment of six months to commence upon the expiration of the non - parole period and expiring on 14 July 2012. The total sentence is, therefore one year comprising the non - parole period and the balance of the sentence. I have found special circumstances. You are to be released to parole at the expiration of the non - parole period. 

24For the charge of corruptly receiving a benefit on 25 November 2009, I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non - parole period of six months commencing on 15 October 2011 and expiring on 14 April 2012. I impose a further period of imprisonment of six months to commence upon the expiration of the non - parole period and expiring on 14 October 2012. The total sentence is therefore one year, comprising the non - parole period and the balance of the sentence. I have found special circumstances. You are to be released to parole at the expiration of the on - parole period. 

25On each of the four charges of giving false evidence to the Independent Commission Against Corruption I sentence you to imprisonment. I set a non - parole period of six months commencing on 15 January 2012, and expiring on 14 July 2012. I impose a further period of imprisonment of nine months to commence upon the expiration of the non - parole period and expiring on 14 April 2013. The total sentence is therefore one year and three months, comprising the non - parole period and the balance of the sentence. I have found special circumstances. You are to be released to parole at the expiration of the non - parole period. 

26Effectively, Mr Wade, that means you will be incarcerated today and you will be first eligible for release to parole, or you will be released to parole, on 14 July next year, which is in 15 months. You will then be on parole for a period of a further nine months. Any other orders sought? 

STAINER: No, your Honour.

2414376,AI v R; R v SB and AI [2011] NSWCCA 95,"Judgment 

1HODGSON JA: On 23 March 2010, AI, JB and SB were arraigned before North DCJ on two counts, namely that they: 

(1) On 20 March 2009 at Rockdale in the State of New South Wales wounded Jordan Ngatupuna with intent to do grievous bodily harm. 

(2) (in the alternative) On 20 March 2009 at Rockdale in the State of New South Wales whilst in the company of each other recklessly wounded Jordan Ngatupuna. 

2The first charge was bought under s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900, and carried a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment and a seven year standard non-parole period. The second charge was brought under s 35(3) of the Crimes Act , and carried a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. 

3Each defendant pleaded not guilty to both charges, and they were jointly tried before North DCJ and a jury. 

4On 9 April 2010, the jury returned the following verdicts: 

AI: not guilty on count 1, guilty on count 2. 
JB: not guilty on both counts. 
SB: guilty on count 1. 

5On 3 September 2010, the trial judge imposed the following sentences: 

AI: A non-parole period of 18 months commencing 26 March 2009 and expiring on 25 September 2010, and a parole period of imprisonment of 18 months to expire on 25 March 2012, to be served as a juvenile offender. 

SB: A non-parole period of four years commencing on 22 March 2009 and expiring on 21 March 2013, and a parole period of imprisonment of three years to expire on 21 March 2016. 

6AI appeals (or seeks leave to appeal) against his conviction. The Crown appeals against the sentences imposed on AI and SB. 

7I will consider first AI's appeal, and then the Crown appeals. 

Common ground 

8The charges related to events that occurred in the late afternoon of 20 March 2009 in the vicinity of the bus interchange adjacent to Rockdale Railway Station. AI was then 17 years old, JB was 15 years old, and JB's brother SB was 18 years old. The incident was captured on CCTV footage, which was shown to the jury and also to this Court. 

9Ultimately, there was and is little dispute as to the following broad outline of what happened. 

10AI, JB and SB were seated at the bus interchange. The victim and a William Poa walked from the train station and walked past the three accused. There was a verbal exchange, and the three accused got up and followed the victim and Mr Poa. 

11AI went up to the victim and Mr Poa and challenged them to fight, and shaped up at them. Mr Poa threw one or more punches at AI, with little effect. JB and SB had been alongside or following AI, and JB approached the victim and Mr Poa. The victim lunged at JB and punched him. SB then came up to the victim, and caused stab wounds to him. The victim fell to the ground with JB, and the stab wounds to his body occurred after this. 

12Meanwhile, AI had drawn a knife and had waved this at Mr Poa. Mr Poa retreated. AI went to where the victim was on the ground and kicked him. The three accused then ran away. 

13It was clearly proved (and not disputed on appeal) that as a result of the incident the victim had wounds to the back of his left arm and to his left buttock, and two knife wounds to his chest, one from the front and one from the back; that the victim lost four to five litres of blood; that the stab wounds to the chest were potentially fatal, and were consistent with stabbing by a penetrating object such as a knife with a sharp edge and a sharp tip; and that considerable force was required to inflict these wounds. 

Crown case 

14The Crown case against AI was based on a joint criminal enterprise to assault the victim, and that it was within the contemplation of AI that a wounding or grievous bodily harm would be occasioned or that wounding or grievous bodily harm could result. I will outline some significant evidence in the Crown case. 

15The victim gave evidence, with reference to the three accused, that ""they pretty much got up and aggressive towards us"" after he had walked past; that ""We walked for a little bit and then we noticed that they were coming""; that it was said in front of everyone that they couldn't fight where they were as there were too many cameras; that JB yelled out ""These guys are just being bitches""; and that ""The way they were approaching us, it was pretty clear that they were going to fight"". The victim said ""They've followed us from the initial contact, and it appeared that they weren't going anywhere and there was going to be a fight either way"" and that ""Their whole approach to us was aggressive"". In answer as to who was interested in a fight, the victim replied ""They were all there"". With reference to JB, the victim said that ""by the way he was looking at me and how he was reacting, it appears as if he was going to hit me""; and that he was ""coming around the side to Will, then I stepped in and punched him"". 

16The victim's evidence was that he punched JB because it looked as if JB was going to approach Mr Poa; that SB approached him from behind holding a knife like a kitchen knife or a steak knife; and that SB had not tried to pull him away from JB before stabbing him in the arm. 

17The victim was shown a silver sword style pendant (Exhibit G) which SB's father had given to the police (which had a handle about two and half centimetres long and a blade about eight centimetres long), and said ""No way could it have been that item"" with which he had been stabbed. 

18Mr Poa gave evidence that the three accused ""were trying to provoke us and pushing us"". He gave evidence that AI had a knife in his hand with a blade about ten centimetres long, which he pointed at him from a direction of one to two metres. 

Defence case 

19AI gave evidence that Mr Poa threw punches at him, that he kept moving backwards, but that Mr Poa got one punch in. AI said he remembered he had a small pocketknife in his waistband and he pulled it out to scare Mr Poa and to keep him away. He did not do this to prevent Mr Poa from helping the victim, but to keep Mr Poa away from himself. 

20AI gave evidence that he did not stab anyone with his knife; that he did not know that either JB or SB had a knife; that he did not think either of them would stab the victim; that he did not see the victim get stabbed; that he first saw blood on the victim's back when the victim stood up as AI was running away; and that he did not know the victim had been stabbed until after the incident had finished. 

21JB gave evidence that on the day he was wearing a chain around his neck with a sword pendant. He gave evidence that the victim punched him a number of times; that he called out to SB; that the victim pulled his shirt over his head; and that he could hear SB scream at the victim to let him go. The victim fell to the ground and brought JB down on top of him; and JB hit the victim two or three times as the victim was still holding him. He could no longer feel the chain round his neck which had been choking him. He did not know what SB was doing because his eyes were closed. The victim let JB go, and he ran away. JB did not know the victim had been stabbed, he never saw any blood, he did not have a weapon and he did not know or expect that weapons would be used. 

22SB gave evidence that he heard JB scream for help; that he saw the victim punching JB and was scared for JB's safety; that he had never been in a fight before; that he ran up behind his brother and pulled; and that JB and the victim fell back. He saw JB's necklace fall off and picked it up and started swinging it at the victim, as he wanted to get his brother free. He was thus trying to defend his brother, but did understand he might hurt the victim. He thought that his brother could get hurt really seriously and that this was all he could do. 

23SB gave evidence that after they ran off, he threw the pendant into a canal. He said it was pretty much identical with Exhibit G. 

Appeal ground 

24AI relies on the following ground of appeal: 

The Jury verdict of guilty in relation to count 2 (alternative) against the appellant was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the whole of the evidence and all of the relevant facts and circumstances of the case including the verdicts of not guilty on counts 1 & 2 against the co-offender [JB], and the verdict of guilty on count 1 against the co-offender [SB]. 

Appellant's submissions 

25Mr I McLachlan for AI accepted that the evidence in respect of count 2 was capable of supporting the jury verdict; and in particular accepted that it was theoretically open on the evidence for the jury to find: 

(a) a joint criminal enterprise to assault the victim; 

(b) that SB wounded the victim by stabbing him with intent to cause grievous bodily harm; 

(c) that AI was in the company of SB at the time he wounded the victim; 

(d) that SB in wounding the victim acted with excessive force in defending JB; and 

(e) that AI was aware it was a possibility that in carrying out the joint criminal exercise SB might act with excessive force to defend JB. 

26However, he submitted that if the jury had found that such a joint criminal exercise existed, then on the particular facts of this case, it could only have been an enterprise in which all three accused were parties. 

27Mr McLachlan submitted that the evidence of a joint criminal enterprise involved JB as much as AI. For example, the victim's evidence was of aggressive behaviour by all three accused, that it was JB who yelled ""these guys are just being bitches"", and that JB looked as if he was going to hit him. Mr McLachlan submitted that in finding JB not guilty, the jury must have rejected the existence of a joint criminal enterprise. 

28Mr McLachlan submitted that the arguments put forward on behalf of AI denying involvement in a joint criminal enterprise were essentially the same as for JB, namely that AI (like JB) did not stab the victim, did not know SB would be armed with a knife, did not encourage JB to stab the victim and did not contemplate that the victim would be stabbed. 

29Mr McLachlan submitted that the jury must have convicted AI on some non-legal judgment about the respective immorality of each offender. 

Decision on AI's appeal 

30I agree with Mr McLachlan's submissions that the jury's verdict against AI must be justified in part on the basis of a finding of a joint criminal enterprise. 

31However, in my opinion it was clearly open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that JB was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to assault the victim, and yet not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he foresaw that, incidentally to this enterprise, SB might use a knife with the possibility that the victim would thereby be wounded. JB would on that basis be entitled to an acquittal on both counts. 

32In my opinion, consistently with this, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that AI was a party to the same criminal enterprise, but that AI did foresee that, incidentally to this joint criminal enterprise, SB might use a knife with the real possibility that the victim would thereby be wounded, and nevertheless proceeded with the enterprise. If the jury were so satisfied (but not satisfied that AI foresaw that SB might use the knife with the intention of causing the victim grievous bodily harm), then the appropriate result would be acquittal of AI on count 1 but conviction on count 2. 

33There are at least three considerations which could justify such a finding, in relation to AI, when a similar finding was not made in relation to JB: 

(1) the evidence (and admission) that AI himself carried and wielded a knife; 

(2) the undisputed evidence that AI kicked the victim when he was on the ground after being stabbed by JB; and 

(3) the fact that all three accused gave evidence, and that the jury could have taken a different view as to the credibility of denials by AI and JB as to their knowledge concerning SB's possession and use of a knife. 

34In saying this, I do not overlook SB's evidence that the instrument he used to stab the victim was a pendant that JB had been wearing. In his remarks on sentence, the trial judge found beyond reasonable doubt that SB did not use that pendant to wound the victim but rather used a knife that SB must have brought to the scene. The trial judge relied particularly on evidence by the victim that he was stabbed first in the left arm while he, JB and SB were all still upright, and on the unlikelihood that the serious injuries to the victim's chest could have been caused by a pendant with a handle about two and half centimetres long. It was certainly open to the jury to reach this same conclusion. 

35Thus, in my opinion there is no inconsistency in the different verdicts in relation to the three participants in this joint illegal enterprise: cf Gillard v R [2003] HCA 64; (2003) 219 CLR 1 at [24]-[25]. 

36For those reasons, in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 

Remarks on sentence 

37Turning now to the Crown appeals on sentence, I have already noted the trial judge's finding beyond reasonable doubt that SB did not use JB's pendant in stabbing the victim. 

38In the remarks on sentence, the trial judge outlined the circumstances leading up to the confrontation, making a finding that the incident was precipitated by AI locking eyes with the victim. The trial judge found the following facts: 

The CCTV clearly shows what happens from this point onwards. The offender [SB], although on the phone, is walking on the road with Mr Ngatupuna and Mr Poa inside on the footpath area with the other two accused in close proximity. The first actual attack was by the offender AI who rushes in, throws a punch that misses due to Mr Ngatupuna taking evasive action. The offender AI then jumps around. The offender AI goes to the roadway area. Soon after this Mr Poa rushes at Mr AI. 

The Crown alleges that this is pre-emptive self defence. Whether it is or not is not of great import because shortly thereafter Mr Ngatupuna rushes [JB] who steps backwards. Again the Crown says this is pre-emptive self defence either by Mr Ngatupuna of himself or of his friend Mr Poa. Mr Ngatupuna is much bigger than [JB] and whether he just lost his temper due to provocation or not it is not necessary to decide whether this was pre-emptive self defence. The jury have obviously found that what happened thereafter in relation to both offenders AI and [SB] either did not amount to self defence or defence of another, or was clearly excessive self-defence. 

I have found in relation to [SB] that I accept that what he did was excessive self-defence, not of himself, but of his brother [JB]. Shortly thereafter whilst facing each other and still both standing, that is, Mr Ngatupuna and [JB], the offender [SB] comes into the fight. I find that whilst still standing Mr Ngatupuna is stabbed in the left arm by [SB], his arm goes limp. I find that he and [JB] forced Mr Ngatupuna back across the footpath up against the Perspex wall. Throughout this Mr Ngatupuna is trapped. 

I have already found that at no stage can the offender [SB] be seen to pick up his brother [JB]'s pendant. Meanwhile I find that Mr AI now armed with a knife is keeping Mr Poa at bay and away from the scene where the two [JB and SB] brothers are fighting with Mr Ngatupuna. I find that Mr AI rushes in twice to the melee between Mr Ngatupuna and the two [JB and SB] brothers. I find that Mr AI kicks at Mr Ngatupuna at one stage when running in. I find that the other wounds occasioned to Mr Ngatupuna occurred after he was stabbed in the left arm and whilst he had been forced to the ground by the two [JB and SB] brothers. I do not find that the offender AI at any stage, although armed with a knife, stabbed Mr Ngatupuna or indeed anyone else. After Mr Ngatupuna is stabbed all three then accused flee the scene. These facts I believe are consistent with the evidence, including the CCTV and the jury verdicts. 

39The trial judge then referred to the victim impact statement, noting that the victim was left lying severely wounded in the street, and that it was only due to prompt and excellent medical treatment at the hospital, when his heart evidently stopped several times, that he was able to survive. 

40The trial judge proceeded to assess the objective seriousness of SB's offence as follows: 

It is clear from my earlier fact finding that Mr Ngatupuna, the victim, received serious injuries. Fortunately, the victim has made quite a good recovery, although I note that he evidently has some permanent nerve damage to the top of his legs and some muscle damage around his chest. He is of course left with the physical and psychological scars of the event. Despite the large and threatening blood loss the victim was released from hospital after one week. 

It is also necessary to look at the degree of violence or the ferocity of the attack as these are material considerations on sentence. Here the offender [SB] has initially just been talking on the phone and shown little apparent interest in the lead up to the incident. Also, even acknowledging that Mr Poa and Mr Ngatupuna had been seriously provoked by the offender AI and to some extent [JB], it was still first Mr Poa and then Mr Ngatupuna who actually engaged in physical contact. 

In this regard I note that the offender AI did throw a punch earlier which Mr Ngatupuna was able to evade. Mr Ngatupuna is a much bigger man than the offender [SB]'s brother [JB], and [JB] was clearly back-stepping following the lunge forward by Mr Ngatupuna. It is in this context that the offender [SB] becomes involved. 

Due to the facts that I have found, although it cannot be seen on the CCTV, just shortly after or just prior to joining Mr Ngatupuna and [JB], that the offender [SB] has armed himself. The first wound occasioned to Mr Ngatupuna is whilst they are still standing. When they go to ground other wounds are inflicted by the offender [SB]. The degree of violence is therefore considerable but is tempered by the fact that [SB] clearly becomes engaged only after Mr Ngatupuna has physically attacked [JB]. 

Further, in assessing the objective gravity of the offence it is necessary to look at the intention with which the offender [SB] has inflicted the harm in this case on Mr Ngatupuna. In this regard, and also looking at the nature of the injuries inflicted, I will not take into account as an aggravating factor circumstances that would warrant conviction for more serious offences. On the question of intention the jury have clearly found that the offender [SB] intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. 

However, I have found that he was motivated by a desire to extricate his brother [JB] from the much larger Mr Ngatupuna. This does not explain why both he and the offender AI found themselves outside Rockdale Station both armed with knives. On balance though I am willing to accept that due to the offender [SB]'s non aggressive behaviour in the lead up to the incident that using the knife was something that he did in the agony of the moment caused by his brother [JB] being attacked by Mr Ngatupuna. This to some extent lessens the objective gravity of this very serious offence. 

There appears to be little evidence of this being a planned organised activity. I find that there was little deliberation and there was practically no time at all for the offender [SB] to react. Indeed, the stabbing incidents follow very quickly, his joining Mr Ngatupuna and [JB]. The offender gave evidence on trial and consistently stated that his motivation was to defend his brother. He repeated this on evidence on sentence. 

However, even having found that he was in possession of a weapon I do not find that the offender [SB] set out that afternoon to use a knife and inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Ngatupuna. The fight did not last long, but there was enough time for the offender [SB] to inflict a number of injuries. Despite the offender AI having initiated the whole incident I cannot come to the conclusion on all the evidence that [SB] was intervening in an assault to back his brother [JB] up. [SB] did not launch an unprovoked attack which would have been objectively more serious. 

This is a case involving violence on the streets of Sydney and deterrence is always an important consideration. People need to be protected against unprovoked attacks whilst going about their ordinary business. Taking all these matters into account, in regard to the offender [SB], I have come to the conclusion that the objective seriousness of the offence falls below the middle range for offences of this kind, but not appreciably so. 

41The trial judge then considered the objective gravity of AI's offence: 

In assessing the objective gravity of the offender AI's matter, I note that he was acquitted by the jury of the more serious charge and convicted on the count of reckless wounding in company, which carries ten years imprisonment. Further, the standard non parole period of four years is not applicable to this offence due to the offender being a juvenile at the time of its commission. Nevertheless a maximum penalty of ten years shows that it is considered to be serious by the legislature. As with the offender [SB] it is necessary to look at the extent and nature of the injuries, the degree of violence as well as the intention of the offender. 

Here the jury verdict on the alternative count means that they have accepted that this offender did not intend, either directly or recklessly, that grievous bodily harm would be occasioned to Mr Ngatupuna. Further, the offender AI did not stab anyone. Although he was the initiator of the incident he was not, except for one kick, actually involved in the physical altercation that involved Mr Ngatupuna being wounded. The jury verdict means that he should have foreseen the possibility that Mr Ngatupuna would be wounded by the offender [SB] and it also means that they have accepted that he was acting in company. 

A case involving significant wounding such as this does not by virtue of that factor alone fall into the worse case category. It is necessary to look at the offender's mental state. The offender was verbally and physically aggressive in the time leading up to the actual stabbing incident. Throughout that incident he was armed with a knife, but fortunately he did not use that knife. The degree of violence, as I have already mentioned, was considerable and there is absolutely no excuse for the offender AI not only keeping Mr Poa at bay by waving his knife, but also on two occasions running over to the area where the stabbings occurred and on occasion launching a kick. 

The offender AI maintained in evidence that he only intended to have a fist fight one on one with Mr Ngatupuna. However, as soon as the incident flared up he became armed with a knife and he used this to ward off Mr Poa. Taking the offender AI's aggressive stance from the very beginning of the incident right through to the end and acknowledging that he did not stab anybody although he wielded a knife I have come to the conclusion that this matter falls below the middle of the range for offences of this type. However, it does not fall into the lowest range, because of the nature of the wounding and the violence involved. 

42The trial judge noted, as aggravating features of the offences, that they were committed while SB was on a bond and AI was on parole; and that they involved the actual and/or threatened use of a weapon. 

43The trial judge then considered the subjective case of SB: 

The offender [SB] is now just twenty years of age, having been only eighteen at the time of the offence. The offender gave evidence both in the trial and before me on sentence. At all times he maintained that he did not anticipate getting into a physical fight and that he only became involved after his brother [JB] was attacked by Mr Ngatupuna. He said that he became involved to defend his brother. I have already found that he did not pick up the pendant from the ground, but I do accept that this all happened very quickly as stated. The jury verdict means that the offender wounded Jordan Ngatupuna with intent to do grievous bodily harm and I have found in that regard that the jury verdict means that he was using excessive self defence in defence of his brother [JB]. 

I have also had regard to the pre-sentence report and to evidence on sentence given by the offender's father [LB]. [LB] spoke about the family, including his wife and sons. All were present in court. He said that his son [SB] was not the kind to get into fights. This is borne out by his criminal record, which contains one set of offences in May 2008 involving non violent crimes for which he was still serving a bond at the time of this offence. It was also obvious that the offender [SB] was very short in stature and quite light in weight, being at the time of the offence approximately five feet tall and weighing fifty-five kilograms. His father spoke candidly about being concerned about the peer group that he was associating with and making changes to his schooling to try and avoid bad influences. He also spoke of the depression and big impact on the family that the involvement of his two sons [SB] and [JB] initially in this crime had caused and subsequent to [SB] being convicted. 

The offender [SB] was born in Australia and is identified as coming from a Lebanese cultural heritage. According to the pre-sentence report he had an unremarkable and happy childhood. Until going into custody on this matter he was residing at home and he plans to return there when he is released from prison. He agreed with his father's evidence and the pre-sentence report, whereby he said he began associating with a group of negative peers at about age fourteen onwards. Despite this his criminal record remained clear until the one set of offences already mentioned in 2008. In this regard, having already taken into account as an aggravating feature that he was on a bond at the time of this offence, his record does, I find, entitle him to some leniency, because of the lack of violent antecedents. 

Evidently he gained his school certificate at around age sixteen and commenced year 11, but lost interest and stopped going to school. The pre-sentence report notes just prior to coming to custody [SB] had enrolled and commenced participation in a financial planning course through an internet college. However, he has deferred this study due to his incarceration. 

He gave the pre-sentence report writer a history of using drugs from age sixteen, including ecstasy, cocaine and benzodiazepine medication. However, he claimed that he was abstinent from any drug use for four months prior to his arrest for this offence and that drug use had nothing to do with the matter before the court. He also stated that he was not under the influence of alcohol at the time of the commission of the offence. 

Whilst in custody there is no record of any failing of urine tests and he has been in custody for 531 days. This long period clearly lends support to the fact that he has continued, albeit partly due to his incarceration, to stay free of drugs and alcohol. 

The offender has steadfastly refused to acknowledge that he used anything other than the pendant picked up from the ground in the spur of the moment to inflict the stab wounds on Mr Ngatupuna. I have found to the contrary. However, the pre-sentence report writer notes the offender made no attempt to excuse his behaviour and acknowledged that it was the wrong thing to do, although the report then goes on to state: 

""Whilst the offender was able to verbalise that he feels bad for what he did to the victim it is considered that his comprehension of victim empathy is at this time only surface level."" 

The offender did repeat in evidence before me on sentence that he felt bad about what had happened and acknowledged that his behaviour was inexcusable. There is still an element of denial throughout the offender's evidence, but I do accept that he was genuinely concerned about the serious nature of the injuries he had inflicted on Mr Ngatupuna. On the issue of remorse I cannot be certain that he is fully and genuinely remorseful, however, he at least deserves some credit for facing up to the serious repercussions of his actions on that day. 

The offender has been employed throughout most of his custodial sentence and has worked in areas such as the furniture unit, the laundry and as a cleaner in the living unit. He gave evidence that he had not been breached for any offences whilst in custody. 

In mitigation I note that he has no history of similar matters and no violence on his record. I note that he was only aged eighteen at the time. This has been his first time in custody and he has been on remand without knowing his fate for a considerable period. Given his coming to terms with drug use and the long period already in prison I find that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. If he is able to return home on his release and receive further support from his family and perhaps counselling to try and have him achieve an understanding of the really serious nature of the offence of this type that [sic] I find that he is unlikely to re-offend in this way. 

The pre-sentence report notes that the offender [SB] presented as being somewhat immature and at times appeared to have considerable difficulty in being able to verbally express himself. However, he remained polite and cooperative throughout. As noted he was only eighteen at the time and it is a great pity, given his relatively stable upbringing, his lack of serious criminal antecedents, that he finds himself before the court at such a young age on such a serious charge. He has been assessed as being suitable for medium level intervention by the Probation and Parole Service in regard to treatment drug use [sic] and anger management counselling. 

44The trial judge reached the following conclusions in relation to SB: 

Here I find that the offence involved in the offender [sic] was not really a planned organised criminal activity despite having found that both he and the offender AI were armed. The offender's whole behaviour leading up to the actual stabbing incident was more one of disinterest whilst using a phone than being part of an apparent planned and organised attack. In this regard my finding is bolstered by the fact that it seems to have been precipitated by the offender AI's actions and the two victims were really random passers-by. There was no evidence given that would allow the court to accept beyond reasonable doubt that the two offenders premeditated this attack. 

I have also found that the offender does not have any significant record of previous convictions. In fact he has no violent convictions at all and although I have found as an aggravating factor that he was on bail at the time I have also found that his record does entitle him to leniency. In addition I have previously found that with further support and counselling the offender is likely [sic] to re-offend in this manner. Also that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, given the fact that he has come to terms with his drug use and the long period that he has already spent in prison. I have previously found that he has exhibited some, though not great remorse and still needs to gain further insight into this particularly serious offence. 

Given these findings and the fact that I have found that the objective gravity is below the middle of the range, but not appreciably so, I intend to set a non parole period that is shorter than the standard period of seven years for offences of this type. There has been no plea of guilty in this matter. However, I do find special circumstances due to the offender's young age at the time of the offence and the fact that he will be spending his first time in prison and I believe that both he and society will benefit from a longer than normal period on parole to ensure his continued rehabilitation. 

45The trial judge then considered the subjective case of AI: 

I will now turn to the subjective features of the offender AI and then return to the actual sentences for both offenders at the end. 

At the outset it should be noted that AI was a juvenile at the time of this offence. 

He did not give evidence on sentence before the court, however, exhibit 1 contained a report of Dr Peter Champion, clinical psychologist, dated 2 June 2010, a letter from the Legal Aid Commission dated 19 April 2010 confirming completion of the Burn Crime Prevention Workshop, merit certificate awards from Putland Education and Training Unit, a certificate of achievement for successfully completing Offence Focus program on 19 March this year, a certificate of achievement for successfully completing Managing Anger program on 6 May last year as well as sentencing statistics. I have also had regard to a confidential background report from Juvenile Justice dated 27 May and exhibit 2 on sentence is a letter from STARTTS, the New South Wales service for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors. 

The offender AI was born in Beirut, Lebanon and has no siblings. His parents separated when he was about four years of age and he remained with his father. When the offender was about twelve years of age his father remarried in Lebanon to [his second wife] , who is an Australian citizen, and together they came out to Australia when the offender was around fifteen years of age and have lived together at their current address in Arncliffe since. 

Evidently the offender's time in Lebanon has impacted significantly on his behaviour, according to the Juvenile Justice Report and the report of Dr Peter Champion. The Juvenile Justice Report also confirmed this with the offender's aunt [...] and his father [...]. The offender experienced gunfire, explosions and helicopters firing from the air and was witness to the death of a man who was shot in front of him and other schoolchildren whilst he was on a school excursion. 

On his arrival in Australia he attended the Kogarah Intensive English Centre from 30 April 2007 to 14 November 2007. He needed to do this in order for him to be able to gain access to school. His English has evidently improved significantly and even more so since he has been in custody. The offender has shown an interest in studying at TAFE and has expressed a desire to train as a plumber. 

The offender confirmed that during his time in Australia he has begun to associate with peers who were not a good influence. He has candidly admitted to beginning drug and alcohol use from around fifteen years of age. He has used cannabis regularly and moved into ice and cocaine use at about aged sixteen. At the time of his offending he was using ice and/or cocaine approximately two days per week and acknowledges that this was strongly linked with his offender related activities. As pointed out, he was actually on parole for a violent offence for assault occasioning actual bodily harm when this offence was committed. 

The offender has indicated a willingness to seek alcohol and drug counselling in the community, but has not considered entering into a residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. Evidently he has been challenging towards staff and other detainees with incidents in gaol, including intimidation and physical altercations being noted in the Juvenile Justice Report. The offender explains this by his feeling of injustice and about the need to survive in custody. 

Although he did not give evidence before me on sentence he did express regret to both the Juvenile Justice Report writer and to the psychologist regarding his actions and the impact that this had on the victim. I am well aware that very considerable caution should be exercised in relying on offender's statements to psychologists and report writers when there is no evidence on sentence. In many cases only very limited weight can be given to such statements. Here, though, a careful examination of the evidence on sentence points to a psychologically damaged young man, who is still growing up and needs to fully understand the true meaning of remorse. Given his background and the difficult time he has had adjusting to a new life in Australia with such a background I am of the view that he is beginning to realise that he cannot act in this aggressive and violent fashion. In saying this I do note that at no stage during the whole altercation did this offender actually use a knife, but as mentioned earlier, he was the initiator of the whole incident and used it only to wield off Mr Poa. 

Dr Champion also points to the effect that his poly drug use may have had in relation to this offence. Evidently he had been smoking ice a day or more before the offence, he then spoke of drinking up to half a bottle of spirits and inhaling three grams of cocaine, which he shared with four others, and smoking a cone of cannabis the night before the offence. He told Dr Champion that as a result he had been feeling hung over on the day of the offence, but had also been feeling other effects, such as feeling that his body was numb, such as having an angry head, feeling generally angry, whilst also feeling that he had power and was strong and feeling that nothing can take me down. He also spoke of having been paranoid and thinking that people might stab or shoot him. If this account is accurate, and I have no other account to go on, that he may well have been significantly substance affected at the pertinent time. That is the conclusion to which Dr Champion came. 

Increasingly courts are noticing offences, especially involving violence where the drug ice, either alone or in combination with other illicit and/or legal substances such as alcohol, is involved. Much of the violence is totally inexplicable and quite often the offender has no explanation. In this case the offender AI from the outset with his actions has acted in an aggressive fashion. Although he locked eyes with Mr Ngatupuna, the primary victim, there was little reason for this to escalate in the way that it did. The offender has said that Mr Ngatupuna did not deserve to get stabbed and that he only expected a 'punch on'. Although he saw nothing wrong with this type of physical confrontation he did acknowledge that the stabbing was wrong. The tortured and illogical thinking behind these types of comments to both Juvenile Justice and Dr Champion, as well as his evidence during the trial, lead me to accept that he probably was affected by various substances, particularly ice, at the time of this offence. This does, of course, not excuse his conduct, but goes in some measure to explain how an incident so benign at first turned into such a serious one. 

Since being in custody he has expressed a desire to move away from his previous circle of friends by redirecting his interests into fitness training, and joining a martial arts group. What he really needs to achieve on being released is a worthwhile occupation, continue with his English learning and hopefully be able to train for a useful trade, such as being a plumber. His family is still supportive and he will need all the help he can get. I agree with the summary of Dr Champion in which he states, inter alia: 

""In sum, AI presents as a psychologically damaged young man. His traumatic experiences probably resulted in anxiety, mood disturbance and also impacted on his social functioning. There is a history given of poly-substance abuse of some severity which has impacted on his mental state, paranoia, and also his psychological functioning, anger management, impulse control. There is a need for psychotherapeutic input, mood/anxiety disorder which will need to continue when he is released as well as AOD, or alcohol and drug intervention."" 

This appears to encapsulate the various problems that this young offender faces, not only now but on release. He needs to address these, otherwise he is at considerable risk of reoffending. Dr Champion says: 

""Those risk factors which can be seen to be present include a previous history of violence, young age at a time of the first violent incident, employment problems, substance use abuse problems, early mal-adjustment, prior supervision failure, impulsivity, potential exposure to destabilisers, potential exposure to stress."" 

Fortunately Dr Champion finds that the risk factor for which there is no compelling evidence, is psychopathy. However, he concludes: 

""In some there are significant risk factors present, the question being whether AI would be willing, or able, to utilise those therapeutic and support services which would be available to him in the community to address these. If he can use the services, avoid substance use, avoid his old associates there is potential for change. If he cannot, then there is a risk of further offending. At this stage I would have to rate his progress as guarded."" 

I agree with this assessment and also with the case plan devised by Juvenile Justice. He will need to follow each of the matters set out therein and have the support of his family in order to achieve rehabilitation and overcome the risk of reoffending. Given his age, the fact that he is still maturing and has been in custody for a considerable period, I am, on balance, if these matters are attended to, convinced that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation and hopefully will be unlikely to reoffend in a violent fashion in the future. 

In his case, whilst there was no plea of guilty entered I do note that he was found not guilty of the more serious charge, and guilty of the alternative count. Both Dr Champion and Juvenile Justice recommend that the offender try and undergo the STARTTS program. Given the offender's unfortunate early years in Lebanon and his consequent behaviour I can only recommend to authorities that he be allowed to commence this whilst in prison and if possible to continue it on release. 


46The trial judge reached the following conclusions in relation to AI: 

It must be remembered that the offender was a young person at the time of this offence. The principle of giving special consideration to the youth of an offender has long been accepted. In R v C unreported 12/10/89, NSW CCA Chief Justice Gleeson accepted a submission that in sentencing young people the consideration of general deterrence is not as important as it would be in the case of sentencing an adult and considerations of rehabilitation should always be regarded as very important indeed. 

Although having decided to deal with this matter by way of law, special principles applicable to children under s 6 of the Children's Criminal Proceedings Act still have to be taken into account. However, the nature of the offence and the actual age of the offender at the time of the offence can both diminish the significance of these factors. Here the offence of which the offender has been found guilty was a violent offence, albeit where the stabbing was not actually perpetrated by this offender and also he was over seventeen years of age at the time. Nevertheless, rehabilitation remains an important issue for a young man of the age of this offender. 

I also accept from the various documentary material before me that this offender has cognitive, emotional and psychological immaturity as a result of his very troubled background and use of illicit substances. Thus the Court needs to place some emphasis on rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution as it is important that this young man eventually become a useful and worthwhile member of society. 

Having said that, I still need to take into account the need for general and specific deterrence, given that this was a violent crime with serious repercussions for the victim. I have been provided with statistics by counsel for the offender and have had regard to them given their acknowledged limitations. 

I have taken into account s 3A and s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and having considered all possible alternatives I am satisfied no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate in this case. Given the offender's age, his mental condition as described by Dr Champion and the other material, I am satisfied that special circumstances exist and that I should make an order directing any sentence to be served as a juvenile offender. 

This is due to the offender being a juvenile at the time this offence was committed, the problems clearly set out in the Juvenile Justice report and the report of Dr Champion and the need for specialised care and counselling. 

Accordingly, I will direct that the following sentence be served as a juvenile offender. 

47On the basis of those considerations, the trial judge passed the sentences set out in par [5] above. 

The Crown's grounds of appeal 

48The original notices of appeal alleged merely that the sentences were manifestly inadequate. At the hearing of the appeal, the Crown sought leave to amend the notices of appeal to include the following grounds: 

In relation to SB 

Ground 1: His Honour erred in his findings regarding the objective seriousness of the offence. 

Ground 2: His Honour erred in failing to impose a sentence that reflected the objective seriousness of the offence. 

In relation to AI 

Ground 1: His Honour erred in his findings regarding the objective gravity of the offence. 

Ground 2: His Honour erred in failing to impose a sentence that reflected the objective gravity of the offence. 

Submissions concerning SB 

49It was submitted for the Crown that the trial judge's finding that the objective seriousness of the offence was below the middle range for offences of this kind, but not appreciably so, was an error; and that the trial judge should have found that the objective seriousness of the offence was above mid range. 

50The Crown submitted that the trial judge wrongly negated the use of the knife as an aggravating factor by his finding that SB was using excessive force in defending JB. 

51The Crown pointed to the following relevant factors: 

(1) SB was in company. 

(2) The case involved violence on the streets of Sydney and was committed without regard to public safety. 

(3) SB stabbed the victim in his left arm and the arm went limp. 

(4) SB and JB forced the victim back across the footpath and up against the Perspex wall. Throughout this the victim was trapped. 

(5) The life threatening wounds occasioned to Mr Ngatupuna occurred after he was stabbed in the left arm and whilst he had been forced to the ground by SB and JB. 

(6) Considerable force was required to produce the wounds. 

(7) The number, severity and location of the stab wounds to the victim lead to a life threatening situation. 

(8) SB left the victim bleeding heavily and did nothing to render assistance: see Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at [85]. 

(9) The victim has ongoing physical damage. (The permanent nerve damage to the top of the legs and some muscle damage around his chest). 

(10) The victim has ongoing psychological damage. (Treatment for extreme post-traumatic stress disorder). 

52In relation to the factor number (2), and the circumstance that the victim was set upon when going about his ordinary business in a public thoroughfare, the Crown referred to a number of authorities including Vaelia v R [2010] NSWCCA 113 at [22] - [23]. 

53In oral submissions, the Crown also submitted that the trial judge erred in finding that the stab wounds inflicted on the victim when he was on the ground were in defence of JB. The Crown submitted that, even if it were open to the trial judge to find that SB's initial use of the knife against the victim was in defence of JB, it was not open to find that the use of the knife after the victim was on the ground was in defence of JB. 

54The Crown submitted that the trial judge was required to impose the standard non-parole period of seven years unless he determined there were reasons for setting a non-parole period that was longer or shorter than the standard period, those reasons being limited to those referred to in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. (I interpolate here that this is as stated in s 54B(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , but it is not really a significant limit: see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [68] - [69].) 

55The Crown pointed to the following factors specified by the trial judge as reasons for setting a shorter non-parole period: 

the offence was not really a planned organised criminal activity despite having found that both SB and AI were armed; 

SB's whole behaviour leading up to the actual incident was more one of disinterest whilst using a phone than being part of an apparent planned and organised attack; 

SB does not have any significant record of previous convictions and this entitles him to leniency; 

he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation; 

special circumstances are found on the basis of his age and he will be spending his first time in prison. 

56The Crown submitted that if the Court finds the trial judge erred in determining the objective seriousness of the offence, then it would find that the sentence failed to reflect the true objective seriousness; and that even if the Court was not prepared to interfere with the trial judge's determination of objective seriousness, it would still find that the sentence did not reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and was manifestly inadequate. 

57The Crown pointed particularly to the circumstances that SB was in company, was carrying a knife, involved himself in an unprovoked attack on two strangers in a public place, caused life-threatening injuries and permanent physical and emotional damage to the victim, and left the victim gravely wounded in the street. 

Decision on SB 

58The approach to be taken in an assessment of objective seriousness for the purposes of application of the standard non-parole provisions was discussed in Way at [85] - [86] as follows: 

[85] The multiplicity of purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Act, quoted above, do not suggest a narrow perspective as to the range of facts and matters that are to be regarded as ""objective"" facts and matters which may affect the judgment involved in assessing ""seriousness"". It is too narrow a perspective to confine attention to the physical acts of the offender and their effects, as those acts or effects could be observed by a bystander. The inquiry which we consider to have been intended is one that would take into account the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct, and those factors that might properly have been said to have impinged on the mens rea of the offender (see for example Fox and Freiberg, Sentencing , 2nd Edition at paras 3.506 to 3.510). 

[86] Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said ""objectively"" to affect the ""seriousness"" of the offence will be personal to the offender at the time of the offence but become relevant because of their causal connection with its commission. This would extend to matters of motivation (for example duress, provocation, robbery to feed a drug addiction), mental state (for example, intention is more serious than recklessness), and mental illness, or intellectual disability, where that is causally related to the commission of the offence, in so far as the offender's capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected: Channon v the Queen (1978) 20 ALR 1 and R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. Such matters can be classified as circumstances of the offence and not merely circumstances of the offender that might go to the appropriate level of punishment. Other matters which may be said to explain or influence the conduct of the offender or otherwise impinge on her or his moral culpability, for example, youth or prior sexual abuse, are more accurately described as circumstances of the offender and not the offence. 

59The approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal to a trial judge's finding as to objective seriousness has been stated as follows in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] by Spigelman CJ and at [46] by Simpson J: 

[37] Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour. In my opinion it was open, although I have some hesitation in deciding so and find it to be at the lower end of the range which could reasonably be held to be so characterised. 

[46] The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance. 

60The first question is whether the trial judge erred in finding that SB was acting in excessive self-defence of JB. The Crown contention was that, even if this were so in the case of the initial stabbing, it was not so in the case of the later stabbing after the victim fell to the ground. 

61The primary judge did find that SB and JB together forced the victim across the footpath against the Perspex wall and forced the victim to the ground. However, JB's evidence was that the victim was still holding him when on the ground, and it seems that there was then a struggle involving at least the victim and JB. The CCTV tape seems to confirm this. The jury verdict was consistent with excessive defence of JB applying to the whole of the incident; and in my opinion, a contrary finding in the sentencing procedure would require finding beyond reasonable doubt that the stabbing of the victim on the ground was not motivated by a wish to defend JB. The trial judge did not make that finding. 

62It can be said that, with the aid of the CCTV material and the facts that were not in dispute, this Court is in a position to say that the trial judge was in error in not making that finding, and that this Court is in a position to make that finding itself. However, the trial judge did have the advantage of seeing the participants give evidence, the whole incident was over very quickly, and there was a struggle on the ground; and I am not satisfied that the trial judge erred in not making a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the later stabbing was not in defence of JB, or in treating the whole episode as excessive defence of JB. 

63Notwithstanding that view, there is considerable force in the Crown's submissions that SB was involved in provoking a fight in a public street while armed with a knife, used that knife to cause life-threatening injuries (and permanent damage) to the victim, and left the victim in the street with those life-threatening injuries; and that this means that the objective seriousness of the offence must be above mid range. 

64However, no error is disclosed in the reasoning of the trial judge, so the question must be whether the trial judge's conclusion as to objective seriousness is such as to justify appellate intervention, notwithstanding what was said in Mulato . The matters relied on by the trial judge were that SB had shown little interest in the matter on the lead up to the incident, that although the victim had been seriously provoked he did physically attack JB, that the victim was a much larger man than either SB or JB, and that what SB did was done in order to defend JB (albeit that it was grossly excessive). These were relevant matters; and having regard to them, I am not satisfied that the trial judge's conclusion as to objective seriousness was so clearly wrong as to justify appellate intervention. 

65The question then is, given this assessment of objective seriousness, was the sentence manifestly inadequate. 

66Again, there is considerable force in the Crown's submissions. The circumstances concerning SB (as distinct from the circumstances of the offence itself) include the aggravating factor that the offence was committed when SB was on a bond, as well as the mitigating factors found by the trial judge, namely that he had no significant record of prior convictions, that there were reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, and his young age and the fact that this would be his first time in custody. However, as noted by the trial judge, the prospects of rehabilitation were perhaps affected by SB's continued untrue denial that he had carried a knife to the scene. 

67Principles concerning the relevance of the youth of an offender to sentencing have been stated as follows by McClellan CJ at Common Law in KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 at [22] - [26]: 

[22] The principles relevant to the sentencing of children have been discussed on many occasions. Both considerations of general deterrence and principles of retribution are, in most cases, of less significance than they would be when sentencing an adult for the same offence. In recognition of the capacity for young people to reform and mould their character to conform to society's norms, considerable emphasis is placed on the need to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation. These principles were considered in R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 at 115-116 (NSWCCA), R v E (a child) (1993) 66 A Crim R 14 at 28 (WACCA) and R v Adamson (2002) 132 A Crim R 511; [2002] NSWCCA 349 at [30]. 

[23] The law recognises the potential for the cognitive, emotional and/or psychological immaturity of a young person to contribute to their breach of the law. Accordingly, allowance will be made for an offender's youth and not just their biological age. ( R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451; [2001] NSWCCA 37 at [25]). The weight to be given to the fact of the offender's youth does not vary depending upon the seriousness of the offence ( Hearne at [24]). Where the immaturity of the offender is a significant factor in the commission of the offence, the criminality involved will be less than if the same offence was committed by an adult. ( Hearne at [25]; MS2 v The Queen (2005) 158 A Crim R 93; [2005] NSWCCA 397 at [61]). 

[24] Although accepted to be of less significance than when sentencing adults, considerations of general deterrence and retribution cannot be completely ignored when sentencing young offenders. There remains a significant public interest in deterring antisocial conduct. In R v Pham & Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 Lee CJ at CL said (at 135): 

""It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court's function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes , particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes. It is appropriate to refer to the decision of Williscroft (1975) VR 292 at 299, where the majority of the Full Court of Victoria expressed the view that, notwithstanding the enlightened approach that is now made to sentencing compared to earlier days, the concept of punishment ie coercive action is fundamental to correctional treatment in our society."" 

[25] The emphasis given to rehabilitation rather than general deterrence and retribution when sentencing young offenders, may be moderated when the young person has conducted him or herself in the way an adult might conduct him or herself and has committed a crime of violence or considerable gravity ( R v Bus , unreported, NSWCCA, 3 November 1995, Hunt CJ at CL; R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [9]-[10]; R v TJP [1999] NSWCCA 408 at [23]; R v LC [2001] NSWCCA 175 at [48]; R v AEM Snr, KEM and MM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [96]-[98]; R v Adamson (2002) 132 A Crim R 511 at [31]; R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [16]). In determining whether a young offender has engaged in ""adult behaviour"" ( Voss at [14]), the court will look to various matters including the use of weapons, planning or pre-meditation, the existence of an extensive criminal history and the nature and circumstances of the offence ( Adamson at [31]-[32]). Where some or all of these factors are present the need for rehabilitation of the offender may be diminished by the need to protect society. 

[26] The weight to be given to considerations relevant to a person's youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity ( R v Hoang [2003] NSWCCA 380 at [45]). A 'child-offender' of almost eighteen years of age cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over eighteen years of age ( R v Bus , unreported, NSWCCA, 3 November 1995; R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182 at [15]). However, the younger the offender, the greater the weight to be afforded to the element of youth ( Hearne at [27]). 

68I accept those principles, but I also adhere to additional comments that I made in BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159 at [4] - [6]: 

[4] First, statements that, in relation to young offenders, principles of retribution may be of less significance and considerations of rehabilitation may be of more significance, may tend to obscure the point that even in relation to retribution the youth of an offender may be a mitigating circumstance. In my understanding, considerations of retribution direct attention to what the offender deserves; and in my opinion, where emotional immaturity or a young person's less-than-fully-developed capacity to control impulsive behaviour contributes to the offending, this may be seen as mitigating culpability and thus as reducing what is suggested by considerations of retribution: see TM v R [2008] NSWCCA 158 at [33]-[36]. 

[5] Second, while I agree with the statements in KT at [26] that the weight to be given to considerations relevant to a person's youth diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity, and that a ""child offender"" of almost 18 years cannot expect to be treated substantially differently from an offender who is just over 18 years of age, it does not follow that the age of maturity is 18 (albeit that for certain purposes the law does draw a line there: Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987). In my understanding, emotional maturity and impulse control develop progressively during adolescence and early adulthood, and may not be fully developed until the early to mid twenties: see R v Slade [2005] 2 NZLR 526 at [43], quoted by Kirby J in R v Elliott [2006] NSWCCA 305; (2006) 68 NSWLR 1 at 27 [127]. As shown by R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37; (2001) 124 A Crim R 451, youth may be a material factor in sentencing even a 19 year old for a most serious crime. 

[6] Third, I do not think courts should be over-ready to discount the relevance of an offender's youth on the basis that the offender has engaged in adult behaviour or acted as an adult. In the present case, the offence is a very serious one; but it did not involve significant planning or reflection, or any other indicia of mature decision-making. The applicant was 16 years old, and in my opinion the circumstances of the offence suggest rather that emotional immaturity and less-than-fully-developed capacity to control impulses were likely to be contributing factors. 

69However, I do accept that, in relation to crimes of violence committed in the streets by groups of young persons, considerations of general deterrence should be given substantial weight, notwithstanding the youth of the offenders: cf R v DGP [2009] NSWSC 1154 at [101] - [102]. 

70Taking all these matters into account, in my opinion the sentence on SB, although a not insubstantial sentence, was a lenient one. However, particularly having regard to the assessment of objective seriousness (which is not set aside), to the youth of SB and to the circumstance that this was a case of excessive defence of his brother, I think the sentence was at the bottom of the range available to the trial judge, rather than being outside that range. 

71For those reasons, I would dismiss the Crown appeal in relation to SB. 

Submissions concerning AI 

72The Crown pointed out that the standard non-parole period of four years for the offence of which AI was convicted did not apply, because AI was a minor at the time of the offence. Nevertheless, the Crown submitted it was not inappropriate for the trial judge to assess the objective gravity of the offence: Curtis v R [2007] NSWCCA 11 at [48]. 

73However, the Crown submitted that the trial judge's finding as to the objective gravity of AI's offence, that it fell below the middle range for offences of this type but did not fall into the lowest range, was erroneous. The Crown submitted that AI was the instigator of the incident, committed the first actual attack, carried and wielded a knife, realised that the victim could be wounded by SB and nevertheless went ahead, and on two occasions ran to the area where the stabbing occurred and on one occasion kicked the victim. The Crown submitted that the trial judge did not take into account that AI left the victim bleeding on the footpath, and did not attempt to assist him or seek medical assistance for him. 

74The Crown submitted that AI's unfortunate background in Lebanon and his youth were relevant to sentencing; but the Crown also noted that at the time of the offence AI was on parole for a matter of violence, namely assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The Crown also referred to the relevance of deterrence in relation to crimes of violence committed on the streets by young offenders, referring to KT and DGP . 

75Accordingly, the Crown submitted that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 

76Mr McLachlan for AI submitted that the case was one of a joint criminal enterprise merely to assault, which got out of hand; and that it was clearly open to the trial judge to characterise the offence as he did. Mr McLachlan submitted that the sentence was not manifestly inadequate. 

77Mr McLachlan also submitted that the Court ought, in the exercise of its discretion, refuse to intervene, relying on AI's affidavit sworn 18 February 2011, which was read on the question of discretion and on re-sentencing, if that question arises. 

78Mr McLachlan relied on the following considerations: 

a. Late particularisation of the appeal grounds: DPP (NSW) v Lombard [2008] NSWCCA 110; 

b. The fact that the second respondent was released on parole on 25 September 2010 (i.e. more than 5 months ago) and has complied with his parole conditions since; 

c. The fact that further time in custody for the second respondent may need to be served in an adult jail; 

d. Fresh evidence as to the second respondent's current living, rehabilitation and vocational situation; 

e. Fresh evidence as to the detrimental effect any further incarceration may have on the second respondent's rehabilitation and vocational situation (including commencement of a new labouring job); and 

f. Fresh evidence as to the second respondent's stress and anxiety relating to the prospect of any further period of incarceration, particularly in an adult jail. 

Decision on AI 

79It is true that the trial judge did not refer to the circumstances of AI leaving the victim, at the time of discussing the objective gravity of AI's offence; but this was referred to elsewhere in his remarks on sentence (in relation to the victim impact statement, which the trial judge did have regard to). I would not infer that the trial judge disregarded this when assessing the objective gravity of AI's offence. 

80It was relevant to the objective gravity of AI's offence that it was not a planned and organised criminal activity, that AI did not stab the victim, that AI did not intend that the victim be wounded or caused grievous bodily harm, and that AI was not reckless as to the causing of grievous bodily harm (as distinct from wounding). Of course, if AI had intended that the victim be caused grievous bodily harm, or had been reckless as to the causing of grievous bodily harm, that would have made him guilty of a more serious offence; but the fact that the victim did actually suffer life-threatening injuries and permanent damage is in my opinion relevant to the objective gravity of AI's offence. 

81On the assumption that AI's youth is not taken into account in assessing the objective gravity of the offence, I think an assessment of objective gravity at below the middle range is not a reasonable assessment. Unlike SB, AI's involvement in the incident was wholly aggressive. He instigated the confrontation with strangers in the street, and (having a knife and being prepared to wield it) committed the first actual attack. Although appreciating that the victim could be wounded, he participated in a physical attack on the victim to the extent of kicking him while he was on the ground; and having seen blood on the victim's back, left him grievously injured in the street. As mentioned earlier, the objective extent of the victim's injuries is also relevant. Notwithstanding what was said in Mulato , I would regard the trial judge's assessment of objective gravity as erroneous. 

82I accept that AI's unfortunate background in Lebanon and his youth were significant subjective factors, as was the trial judge's assessment that AI has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. However, so also was the circumstance that this serious offence of violence was committed when AI was on parole for another offence of violence; and taking all these things into account, I am of the view that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. Specifically, in my opinion, a non-parole period of two years and a further term of two years would have been at the very bottom of the available range. 

83However, AI was released from custody on 25 September 2010, and has been on parole since then. Having regard to this, and to the matters relied on by Mr McLachlan, I would in the exercise of discretion not intervene in this particular case. 

Orders 

84For those reasons, in each of these appeals (that is, the appeal of AI against conviction, and the Crown appeals against the sentences imposed on SB and AI), I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 

85ADAMS J: I agree with Hodgson JA. 

86HALL J: I agree with Hodgson JA.

		27 April 2011",2011-04-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2414490,NGUYEN v REGINA [2011] NSWCCA 111,"Judgment 

1ALLSOP P : I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Hall J. I have one reservation which disables me from agreeing with the orders that he proposes. Given the unqualified agreement of Hoeben J with the reasons of Hall J, there is no necessity for me to resolve finally the reservation that I have. 

2I am unwilling to agree with the disposition of the argument put forward by Mr Odgers SC as to the ""double counting"" in relation to the multiple occasions on which the applicant offended. The disposition of this argument involves, on one view, a resolution of the views expressed by different courts in R v Huang, R v Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259; 174 A Crim R 370 and Cicciarello v R [2009] NSWCCA 272, beyond, or in different terms from, that undertaken by Hall J. 

3I have come to the view that I do not need to resolve this issue because, even assuming some error as argued, I would resentence the applicant to no lesser term of imprisonment than was imposed by the sentencing judge. Though the term of imprisonment passed, including the non-parole period, was by no means light, the Commonwealth Parliament has made clear the seriousness of the offence and the gravity and weight of punishment should contravention occur. The very same consideration (the repetition of offences) even if not going to the objective criminality because of the collocation of events to make up $1 million for the application of the relevant section, does go to personal subjective deterrence. 

4Given my agreement with the reasons of Hall J otherwise and the above remarks, the order that I would make is that I would refuse leave to appeal. 

5HOEBEN J : I agree with Hall J. 

6HALL J : The applicant pleaded guilty to a charge under s.400(3)(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) that between 1 November 2007 and 14 January 2008 she dealt with in excess of $1 million where a risk existed that the money would become an instrument of crime and she was reckless to that risk. 

7The maximum penalty for such an offence is 12 years' imprisonment and/or a fine of $79,200. 

8On 25 June 2010, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years and 6 months commencing 25 June 2010 and expiring on 24 December 2015, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 24 December 2013. 

Factual matters 

9The applicant has born on 6 October 1955. She is, accordingly, aged 55 years. 

10The following facts were summarised in the Crown's written submissions:- 

""6. The Applicant was the manager, authorised representative and compliance manager of a money transfer business, which operated from a number of locations including inside a fabric shop in Cabramatta and inside a Vietnamese green grocery in Bankstown. 

7. In the course of that business, the Applicant received large amounts of cash from customers along with instructions to transfer the funds to beneficiaries in Vietnam. Commonly, those instructions falsely purported to originate from registered customers of the business, bore false names and signatures and directed multiple transfers of the funds, artificially split up into amounts of less than $10,000.00, often to the same beneficiary on the same date. The Applicant deposited the cash into the business bank account to cover the value of the instructions received. 

8. The Applicant failed to obtain any identification from customers for any of the relevant cash transfers and failed to instruct her employees about the reporting requirements of the Financial Transaction Reports Act ... 

9. The Applicant instructed employees of the business that it was permissible for a customer to send more than $10,000.00 if it was split up into two or more transfers of less than $10,000.00 each, and that in those circumstances no customer identification was required; and it was acceptable for customers to sign in different names and that, provided each transfer was for less than $10,000.00, the customer's signature was no important."" 

11Leading up to April 2006, the applicant received training and information from AUSTRAC, the Commonwealth Government Agency responsible for training, monitoring and reviewing cash dealers and designated remittance services for compliance with legislation including the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth). 

12In 2007 and 2008, the applicant operated an international money transfer business. The business' head office was responsible for lodging with AUSTRAC significant cash transaction reports, for cash dealings of $10,000 of more for itself and all of its branches and agents (19 in all including the Bankstown branch). 

Remarks on sentence 

13The sentencing hearing took place on 4 December 2009 and 11 June 2010. A detailed statement of facts was tendered. 

14The sentencing judge, in his remarks on sentence made on 25 June 2010 (p.1), set out the facts as summarised by the Crown as follows:- 

""(1) During the relevant two and half month period, the offender, through her money transfer business, collected $1,948,014.26 in cash together with 234 instructions to transfer that money to Vietnam. 

(2) On each occasion, when the cash was presented to the money transfer business for subsequent transfer to Vietnam, it was presented in amounts greater than $10,000 and then counted out in a number of smaller amounts, each of less than $10,000. The customer then completed a series of written instruction sheets, which often involved false names. 

(3) The counting out of the cash into less than the $10,000 lots were carried out by:- 

(a) the customer in the presence of this offender or her staff; 

(b) the offender; or 

(c) one of the offender's employees. 

(4) The offender then took possession of the cash and the written transfer instructions. 

(5) Acting on these written instructions, the offender took the cash to her bank each day and then conducted international money transfers to Vietnam. In total, she conducted 234 international money transfers over the charged period, each for an amount of less than AUD$10,000. 

(6) As a result, the offender avoided the obligations under the Financial Transactions Reports Act to report significant cash transactions. 

(7) In total, the offender transferred $1,948,014.26 over a two and a half month period."" 

The statutory provisions 

15The relevant provisions are contained in Part 10.2 - Money laundering - of Chapter 10 - National infrastructure - in the Criminal Code Act . 

16Section 400.3 is entitled Dealing in proceeds of crime etc - money or property worth $1,000,000 or more . 

17Extracted below are the provisions of s.400.3(1) and (2). As noted above, the applicant was charged with an offence under s.400.3(2). However, the submissions made on her behalf focused attention on that section in the context of the companion provisions constituting s.400.3(1):- 

""400.3 Dealing in proceeds of crime etc - money or property worth $1,000,000 or more 

(1) A person is guilty of an offence if: 

(a) the person deals with money or other property; and 

(b) either: 

(i) the money or property is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime; or 

(ii) the person intends that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 

(c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more. 

Penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years, or 1500 penalty units, or both. 

(2) A person is guilty of an offence if: 

(a) the person deals with money or other property; and 

(b) either: 

(i) the money or property is proceeds of crime; or 

(ii) there is a risk that the money or property will become an instrument of crime; and 

(c) the person is reckless as to the fact that the money or property is proceeds of crime or the fact that there is a risk that it will become an instrument of crime (as the case requires); and 

(d) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money and other property is $1,000,000 or more. 

Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 years, or 720 penalty units, or both."" (emphasis added) 


18Recklessness is a fault element in an offence under s.400.3(2). In accordance with the general principles of criminal responsibility set out in Chapter 2 of the Code, an offence under s.400.3(2) involves both physical and fault elements. 

19Section 5.4, Recklessness , is in the following terms:- 

""5.4( 1) A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if: 

(a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and 

(b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 

(2) person is reckless with respect to a result if: 

(a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the result will occur; and 

(b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 

(3) The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact. 

(4) I f recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element. "" 

20I will return to consider the significance of s.5.4(4) to this case below. 

21The sentencing judge considered the objective seriousness of the offence. It is this part of the remarks in particular that is the subject of criticism in relation to Ground 1 of the grounds of appeal which are set out below. The second paragraph in the extract below is relevant to the submissions on Ground 2. His Honour stated (Remarks on Sentence, p.2):- 

""... These facts reveal an objectively serious offence. It was an offence that involved 234 separate transactions totalling nearly two million dollars. The offence involved flagrant breaches of the law given the remittance of monies sent overseas and it was carried out to avoid the statutory reporting requirements for amounts exceeding $10,000. 

The amount of money together with the total number of transactions places the offence at less than the mid-range of objective seriousness for such offences, but not very far below it."" 

22His Honour proceeded to observe (Remarks on Sentence, p.3):- 

""... the governing principle is that I must impose a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances. 

In cases such as this, general deterrence is of significant importance to send a message to like minded people in the community that such activities will be met with condign punishment. 

The subjective factors in the offender's favour are taken from material tendered and the evidence of the offender's daughter ... The offender was born on 16 October 1995 in Vietnam. She is the eldest of seven children. At the end of the Vietnam War, she had been at university, but did not complete her studies. When the Communist took control of Vietnam, she fled the country with two of her brothers to Malaysia and then Australia."" 

23The sentencing judge then set out an extract from a report by Dr Tim Watson-Munro (Exhibit A) and referred to the evidence of the applicant's daughter to the effect that she was now running the business and was fully ""complying with all the requirements"" . She stated that her mother was no longer conducting business transactions. She had only been involved in administration. 

24The sentencing judge additionally noted the evidence to the effect that the applicant was the manager of the money transfer business which operated from a number of locations, was the authorised representative and compliance manager of the money transfer business and was the only person authorised to lodge reports required by the Financial Transaction Reports Act . Reference was made in the remarks on sentence (p.4) that the applicant dealt with large amounts of cash in the course of running the business by receiving cash from customers, depositing it into the business bank accounts and arranging for the money to be telegraphically transferred to Vietnam. 

25The applicant received instructions from customers and made multiple cash transfers each in the amount of less then $10,000 using multiple false names and using false signatures. 

26In the remarks it was observed that, in the period charged (between 1 November 2007 and 14 January 2008), a period of approximately 10 weeks, 234 transfers were made by the applicant to Vietnam, totalling $1,948,014.26. 

27The sentencing judge then recorded the following finding (Remarks on Sentence, p.5):- 

""I find on the basis of this evidence that the role of the offender was significant. Increased profits through commissions or greed was the motive for the offending. The offender did not give evidence before me and express any remorse for the offence. She did tell Dr Watson-Munro that she had a sense of shame as a result of the offending."" 

28His Honour noted that general deterrence as an important consideration in the sentencing exercise ""involving as it does money laundering"" and that the legislature had reflected the seriousness of the offences by presenting high maximum custodial sentences as penalties (Remarks on Sentence, p.5). 

29Reference was also made to the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty on the day after the trial was due to start on 4 July 2009. A discount on sentence of 15% was allowed on account of the plea. 

30It was noted that the offender had prior convictions in 2001 involving the making and using a false instrument, both offences arising out of the offender's money transfer business. The sentencing judge also noted that significant specific deterrence was an important element in sentencing for the offence. 

Notice of application for extension of time 

31The applicant relied upon a notice to extend time to appeal dated 21 January 2011, it being noted that there had been no application for leave to appeal given within the three months of sentence. 

Grounds of appeal 

32There were three grounds in the following terms:- 

""1. The sentencing judge breached the principle in R v De Simoni . 

2. The sentencing judge erred in taking into account the number of transactions when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. 

3. The sentencing judge erred in increasing the sentence imposed on the basis of 'on-going persistent criminal conduct of the offender'."" 

Ground 1: The sentencing judge breached the principle in R v De Simoni 

(1) Applicant's submissions 

33In the written submissions for the applicant reference was made to specific matters set out in the Statement of Facts (Exhibit 1), in particular, the fact that it was recorded that the applicant instructed her staff that if a customer wanted to send more than $10,000 overseas but wished to split it up into two or more transfers of less then $10,000, that was permissible (paragraph 32). 

34It was also observed that it appeared to have been accepted at the sentencing proceedings that a higher commission was paid if money was divided up in this way (a fee or commission of between $8 and $20 was charged for each transfer: paragraph 37). There were no automatic systems in place to calculate commissions on transfers of more than $10,000 (paragraph 35), although the evidence was given from the applicant's daughter that, during the relevant period, some transfers of more than $10,000 were made and reported (transcript, p.18). 

35It was noted that it was not recorded in the Statement of Facts that the applicant knew, when she made particular transfers, that amounts of greater then $10,000 had been structured to avoid reporting requirements. 

36Mr S Odgers SC, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, submitted that the sentencing judge had breached the principle in R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383. It was contended that the applicant was sentenced on the basis that, when she took possession of the money, she ""intended"" that the money would be transferred out of Australia in amounts of less than $10,000 and thereby avoid the reporting requirement attaching to transfers of $10,000 or more. In other words, she intended to avoid the statutory reporting requirements for amounts exceeding $10,000. 

37The applicant did not plead guilty to the more serious offence under s.400.3(1) of dealing with more than $1 million intending that the money would become an instrument of crime under s.31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act . The applicant was charged, as noted above, with an offence that she was reckless to the risk that the money would become an instrument of the commission of an offence under s.31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act . 

38The well-known principles were stated in De Simoni (supra) by Gibbs CJ at 389 (Mason and Murphy JJ agreeing) in the following terms:- 

""[T]he general principle that the sentence imposed on an offender should take account of all the circumstances of the offence is subject to a more fundamental and important principle, that no-one should be punished for an offence of which he has not been convicted ... The combined effect of the two principles, so far as is relevant for present purposes, is that a judge, in imposing sentence, is entitled to consider all the conduct of the accused, including that which would aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence."" 

(2) Crown submissions in reply on Ground 1 

39The Crown, in its written submissions, correctly observed that the argument in support of Ground 1 depended entirely on the construction of the sentencing remarks reproduced in paragraph [22] above. 

40The Crown submitted that the relevant part of the remarks amounted to (Crown Submissions at [12]):- 

""12. ... a global description of the nature and purpose of the offence and its objective seriousness. The impugned remarks do not focus upon the Applicant's state of mind, nor do they focus the Applicant's role in the offending. It is beyond question that the purpose of remitting the sums of money of less than $10,000 was to avoid the statutory reporting requirements. The Applicant's role was to facilitate, on instructions from customers wishing to send money overseas, the counting of larger amounts of money into sums of less than $10,000. The counting of the cash into these smaller amounts was carried out by:- 

(a) the customer in the presence of the Applicant or her staff; 

(b) the Applicant; or 

(c) one of the Applicant's employees. 

The applicant would then take possession of the cash and the written transfer instructions and effect money transfers each in the sum of less than $10,000 to Vietnam."" 

41The Crown contended that it was clear from the remarks on sentence that the sentencing judge was clearly mindful of the offence for which he was sentencing the applicant. Reference was made to the relevant passages in the remarks on sentence (p.5) in which his Honour referred to the relevant charge against the applicant as involving ""recklessness"" . 

42That was the basis, it was submitted, upon which the applicant was sentenced and not, as contended by the applicant, on the basis of and intentional dealing within s.400.3(1) of the Code. 

43Accordingly, it was submitted Ground 1 had not been made out and should be dismissed. 

(3) Consideration of Ground 1 

44The observations made by the sentencing judge (at p.2) to which attention has been drawn, namely, ""... it (the charge) was carried out to avoid the statutory reporting "" , considered in isolation, provides a basis for the argument presented on behalf of the applicant. There was a need, as Mr Odgers submitted, for the sentencing judge to articulate with some precision the relevant matters as to the objective seriousness of the offence. In that respect, it was submitted (transcript, 9 May 2011 at p.2):- 

""My response [to the Crown submissions] is that in this case, given the difficulty, given the very fine lines that are drawn between the offence to which she pleaded guilty and the more serious offence, ... this case, given those difficulties, his Honour really did need to be very careful in his remarks on sentence to make it clear that he understood what he was sentencing the applicant for and what he was not sentencing her for and not punishing her for."" 

45In the course of submissions, the presiding judge, the learned President, raised with Mr Odgers the proposition that, although the sentencing judge was sentencing for an offence based on recklessness, it is possible to envisage a range of circumstances amounting to ""reckless"" conduct. At the lower end of a possible range, the ""reckless conduct"" may involve laziness or failure to undertake property training, whilst at the higher end recklessness conduct may involve intentional action. In general terms, a heavier sentence may be expected at the higher end of the range of recklessness. 

46I have earlier set out the definition of ""recklessness"" in s.5.4 of the Code. As there noted, if recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence by the terms of s.5.4, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element. Accordingly, in light of the definition, it is possible to envisage that there may be cases in which intention may be proved in relation to a physical element for an offence under s.400.3 for the purpose of establishing recklessness as an element of an offence under s.400.3(2). 

47I am of the opinion that although substantial, it cannot be said that the sentence imposed is itself indicative of a sentencing exercise directed to an offence under s.400.3(1) rather than an offence under s.400.3(2). 

48Furthermore, an examination of the whole of the remarks on sentence, in my opinion, indicates that the sentencing judge was mindful throughout the sentencing process that he was sentencing in respect of an offence involving the concept of recklessness. That is clear, not only from the opening paragraph of the remarks on sentence, but also from the detailed recitation of factual matters relied upon in respect of the objective seriousness of the offence. These did not indicate that the sentencing judge had made an his assessment on the basis of factual matters directed to an offence under s.400.3(1)(b)(ii) of the Code. 

49Whilst the reference in the remarks to remittance of monies ""to avoid the statutory reporting"" was inappropriate as a description of the facts, seen in context, they should not be given an interpretation that overrides the substance of the matters which are otherwise set out in the remarks on sentence which are wholly consistent with criminal conduct referred to in s.400.3(2). 

50I have, accordingly, concluded that Ground 1 should be dismissed. 

Grounds 2 and 3 

Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in taking into account the number of transactions when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. 

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in increasing the sentence imposed on the basis of ""on-going persistent criminal conduct of the offender"". 

51These two grounds were argued together. 

(1) Specific matters 

52I have earlier referred to the facts agreed for the purposes of sentencing, namely, that the applicant conducted 234 international money transfers over the approximate 10 week period, each transfer being for an amount less than AUD$10,000 and that the total transferred in that period was $1,948,014.26. 

53The indictment charged the applicant with dealing with money, being $1,000,000 or more, contrary to s.400.3(2) of the Code. The indictment set out the following particulars:- 

""Trang Thi Phuong Nguyen did possess money reckless to the fact that it would become an instrument of crime, namely, an offence contrary to section 31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 committed by [company name] trading as [business name]."" 

54The sentencing judge took into account the number of transactions where amounts of less than $10,000 were transferred overseas, thereby avoiding the statutory reporting requirements for amounts exceeding that amount, when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. The sentencing judge made observations in the remarks as to relevant factors to be taken into account, including (Remarks on Sentence, p.6):- 

""The need for a strong subjective deterrent aspect, given the ongoing persistent criminal conduct of the offender"" 

(2) Submissions for the applicant 

55It was submitted for the applicant that to take into account the total number of transactions in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence and to impose a more severe penalty because the criminal conduct was ""on-going"" and ""persistent"" , was an error as the Crown had chosen to proceed with a single offence under s.400.3(2) of the Code rather than a number of offences under s.31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act . 

56The complaint was that the Crown had combined a large number of separate ""possessions"" by the applicant of less than $10,000 into ""a possession"" of more than $1,000,000 ( Applicant's Written Submissions at [14]). It was said that one result of this was to make the applicant liable to the maximum penalty of 12 years, rather than a maximum penalty of only 5 years for the four offences under the Financial Transaction Reports Act . 

57The submission was that where multiple criminal acts are the foundation for a more serious offence, to take account of the number of individual acts as an aggravating factor in assessing objective seriousness constituted ""impermissible double counting"" . Reliance for this proposition was placed upon the decision of this Court in Cicciarello v R [2009] NSWCCA 272 at [19]. 

58I note at this point that that case concerned a charge of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine: the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), s.25(2). I will return to the decision in Cicciarello (supra) below. 

59In a case involving multiple criminal acts which are the foundation for a more serious offence, to increase the sentence imposed on the basis of ""ongoing persistent criminal conduct of the offender"" it was submitted, constituted an impermissible double counting. At the very least, it was incumbent on the sentencing judge, it was submitted, to explain how the number of acts had been taken into account in a way that does not involve double counting. 

60In the course of his oral argument, Mr Odgers contended that there was a need to resolve two potentially conflicting principles when sentencing an offender involving multiple acts. 

61The first principle entitles a sentencing judge to take into account the number of times something is done (as in a case involving a course of criminal conduct) as that would be relevant to the state of mind of the offender. On the other hand, there is the sentencing principle which proscribes double counting. The principle of ""double counting"" , it was contended, trumps other principles (transcript, 9 May 2011, p.8). 

62In support of his argument, Mr Odgers stated that each of the individual transactions undoubtedly involved the less serious offence under s.400.7(2) which carried a maximum penalty of 2 years. He said in that situation the ""principle of double counting"" must be applied. 

63Finally, Mr Odgers submitted that the applicant should be re-sentenced. He emphasised that it was important to recognise that this is not a case where the money constituted proceeds of crime or a case where the applicant suspected that the money would be used as an instrument of crime, other than the reporting offence. This, it was said, was an important distinction from cases such as R v Huang & Siu (2007) 174 A Crim R 370 (where, for example, Siu was aware the money was unlawfully obtained and Huang was aware that the purpose of the transaction was to avoid tax). It was said that the applicant's criminality was not aggravated by any belief that the money was the result of illegal activity or by a belief that some criminality other than an offence under the Financial Transaction Reports Act was contemplated. 

64It was also submitted that the financial gain to the applicant was very limited. 

(3) Crown submissions 

65The Crown contended that the fact that the applicant was not charged with one or more offences under s.31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act is an irrelevant matter. The indictment made it clear that s.31(1) of that Act was a mere particular of the risk that money in the possession of the applicant would become an instrument of crime. It was said that the applicant was reckless as to the existence of that risk. Accordingly, there was no substance to the point that the applicant was charged with one count under s.400.3(2) of the Code instead of a number of offences under s.31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act . 

66Further, there was no substance to the submission that the applicant had committed 234 offences under s.400.7(2), each carrying a maximum penalty of only 2 years imprisonment, which the Crown chose to aggregate into one offence under s.400.3(2) carrying the maximum penalty of 12 years imprisonment. 

67The Crown observed that there was nothing to suggest that charges under either s.400.7(2) of the Code or offences under s.31(1) of Financial Transaction Reports Act were ever in contemplation. 

68The decision to charge a person at all, or the crime with which to charge a person, is one that is solely within the province of the prosecuting authorities. The submission, in relation to the availability of alternative charges, it was contended, can do no more than speculate about what motivated the prosecution to charge the applicant as it did. 

69The proper characterisation of the charge, it was submitted, was the charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty, being a single charge involving $1,948,014.26 in cash, the particulars of which involve 234 transfer transactions. 

70The Crown further submitted there was no sentencing error in the approach of the sentencing judge in taking into account the ""on-going"" and ""persistent"" conduct of the offender. 

71The Crown relied upon the observations of this Court in Huang & Siu (supra) at [35] as follows:- 

""Of course, the number of transactions carried out by the offender in committing the offence and the period over which the transactions occurred are significant because they indicate the extent of the offenders' criminality. Generally speaking, a number of transactions involving small amounts of money will be more serious than a single transaction of a larger amount. The latter will be seen as an isolated offence."" 

72It was submitted for the Crown that the reasoning in this paragraph in Huang is directly contrary to the applicant's contention as to ""double counting"" . The Crown also relied upon the observation in Huang at [34]:- 

""The amount of money is clearly a highly significant matter because the legislation uses it as a principal means of dividing the offences into categories and it is the primary identifier of what is the maximum penalty for an offence."" 

(4) Consideration of Grounds 2 and 3 

73The question in the present case is whether it was correct to say that the principle against double counting had been breached by the sentencing judge. 

74In sentencing in respect of an offence under s.400.3(2), a sentencing judge is required to have regard to those facts which are relevant in determining, inter alia, the extent or degree of recklessness involved in a particular case of offending under that provision. 

75The submissions advanced in relation to Grounds 2 and 3 require consideration of whether the possibility of ""double counting"" arises having regard, in particular, to:- 

(1) The provisions of s.400.3(2) under which the applicant was charged and the criminality of such offending. 

(2) The provisions of s.400.7(2) and of s.31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act and the criminality to which those provisions are directed. 

(3) The issue of double counting the subject of consideration in Cicciarello (supra) (an offence of supply prohibited drugs on three or more separate occasions in the specified period: s.25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985). 

(4) Whether the sentencing judge's remarks indicate that the number of transactions were treated as an aggravating circumstance. 

76I note two matters:- 

(1) The Crown, in charging the applicant with an offence under s.400.3(2) of the Code, was, of course, entitled to rely upon the 234 transactions in the relevant 10 week period totalling in excess of $1,000,000 

(2) The fact that a person may also be liable for an offence other than one under s.400.3(2) (for example, under s.400.7(2) for dealing in money valued in excess of $1,000 or more), is not a matter that, of itself, establishes double counting in this case. On the facts of the case, any potential liability the applicant could be said to have had under s.400.7(2) does not mean that, in taking account of the number of transactions for the purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed in the present case, those transactions were treated as an aggravating factor. 

77It was, of course, not only open, but it was necessary for the sentencing judge, in evaluating the objective seriousness of the criminality involved in the offence charged, to take into account the fact that the offending involved 234 separate transactions totalling almost $2 million. In that regard, the sentencing judge did not attach significance merely to the number of transactions, but to the composite facts as agreed, including the fact that the transactions involved dealing with money contrary to s.400.3(2) involved in excess of $1 million. Those matters were relevant matters in determining the objective criminality involved in the offending conduct and, in particular, in relation to the issues of specific and general deterrence. 

78On an examination of the remarks on sentence, there is no indication that the sentencing judge additionally treated those matters as aggravating factors contrary to the prohibition against double counting. They were, as I have stated, properly taken into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence charged but not otherwise. 

79In Cicciarello (supra), on the other hand, this Court determined that the multiple criminal acts which were the foundation for the more serious offence with which the applicant in that case was charged, namely, supply of not less than a commercial quantity of the drug for which a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment was provided, were also regarded and treated by the sentencing judge as aggravating factors. 

80The aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(m) is directed to a situation where a single offence contains a number of allegations of criminal acts that are part and parcel of a single course of criminal conduct. As observed by Howie J in R v Tadrosse (2005) 65 NSWLR 740 at [29], a charge of that nature will frequently be found in cases of fraud or dishonesty perpetrated against a single victim such as a charge of embezzlement or larceny as a servant. Similarly, his Honour referred to a charge involving multiple instances of supplying drugs over a period of time as one offence under s.25 of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act . As his Honour stated in Tadrosse (supra) at [29]:- 

""... When sentencing for such an offence, the court must bear in mind the prohibition against taking into account as a matter of aggravation that which is an element of the offence charged."" 

81I do not consider that the sentencing judge's reference to ""... ongoing persistent criminal conduct"" indicates that, having determined the objective criminality of the offence, the sentencing judge ""double counted"" in the manner or on the basis argued for the applicant. The sentencing judge said that he took a number of factors into account but it is clear that this was after having determined the objective seriousness of the offence and only for the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence including:- 

""(2) The need for a strong subjective deterrent aspect, given the ongoing persistent criminal conduct of the offender;"" 

82The latter statement gave effect to one of the stated purposes of sentencing in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, namely:- 

"" 3A Purposes of sentencing 

The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows: 

... 

(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender ... 

..."" 

83The statement does not carry with it the inference or conclusion that the sentencing judge considered the repetitive criminal acts (the 234 transactions) as aggravating factors additional to it having been relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence. 

84I am, accordingly, of the opinion that Grounds 2 and 3 should be dismissed. 

Orders 

85In relation to the Notice of Application for an Extension of Time dated 21 January 2011, there was no submission made that an extension should not be granted. In those circumstances, to the extent that an extension of time is required, I propose to make an appropriate order in that respect. 

86I propose the following orders:- 

(1) That the time for the making of an application for leave to appeal be granted. 

(2) Leave to appeal be granted. 

(3) The appeal be dismissed.

		18 May 2011",2011-05-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2414548,Whitbread & Anor v Rail Corporation NSW & Ors [2011] NSWCA 130,"Judgment 

1GILES JA : I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons of Whealy JA, and the reasons of McColl JA as to exemplary and aggravated damages. I agree with Whealy JA, including that the conduct of Schofield was not such as to warrant exemplary damages and that the trial judge did not err in taking account, as relevant factors but by no means determinative, of the plaintiffs' behaviour and the criminal and disciplinary proceedings against Schofield. I would observe that the question in Niven v SS [2006] NSWCA 338 was whether the subsequent acquittal was a bar to exemplary damages, not whether regard could be had to the subjection to the criminal process. 

2I agree with the orders proposed by Whealy JA. 

3McCOLL JA: I have read Whealy JA's reasons. I agree with his Honour's reasons save as to the issue of aggravated and exemplary damages. I shall not repeat the facts save to the extent necessary to explain my reasons. 

Exemplary damages 

4It is convenient to deal first with exemplary damages. 

5Both appellants' claims for exemplary damages were based, in part, on Schofield's physical attack on them (described in their pleadings as unprovoked), its gravity, the physical injury the appellant suffered and the contemptuous manner in which the respective appellant's rights were abused. 

6Whealy JA has set out (at [115]) O'Connor DCJ's reasons for rejecting the appellants' claims for exemplary damages. 

7It is not, with respect, clear why the primary judge refused to award exemplary damages. His Honour referred to the facts that the power to award such damages should be exercised with restraint, that such damages were only awarded when the defendant's conduct was of such a character that it merited punishment in the sense that it must have been knowingly wanton, fraudulent, malicious, violent, cruel, insolent, highhanded or an abuse of power and to the relevance of the abusive and belligerent behaviour ""of the plaintiff"". His Honour also took into consideration ""the fact that [Schofield] was prosecuted for assault on both plaintiffs and found guilty of those offences in the Local Court"" - although he noted that the conviction in respect of Christian was quashed on appeal to the District Court while ""[t]he finding of guilt in respect of Sebastian Whitbread was confirmed, but his conviction was quashed pursuant to the provisions of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ."" His Honour referred to the fact that Schofield ""was also subject to disciplinary proceedings and suspended from his employment"". 

8The primary judge did not, however, indicate which of these factors he regarded as determinative against an award of exemplary damages. 

9I will discuss each matter the primary judge mentioned in these reasons. Before doing so three factual matters should be mentioned. 

10First, it is relevant to recall the primary judge's findings based on his review of the CCTV footage of Schofield's attack on the appellants: 

""The CCTV does not reveal any physical act of aggression by either plaintiff before Schofield lunged at Sebastian. There is no suggestion in any of the statements in exhibit H that either plaintiff punched or struck any of the transit officers."" 

11His Honour's observations accord with my viewing of the CCTV footage. The incident is also, in my view, captured in still photographs which were tendered at trial. I am conscious of the need for restraint in using photographic evidence and refer to them as explicating the evidence of the circumstances in which Schofield assaulted each appellant: see generally Blacktown City Council v Hocking [2008] NSWCA 144. 

12The photographs show that immediately before the incident the appellants were standing with their arms straight beside them while the man identified as Schofield is both speaking (apparently to Sebastian) and gesturing with his right arm. In addition to Schofield, eight burly uniformed men surround the appellants - they were, as the primary judge found ""clearly outnumbered"". There is a distance of possibly a metre or so between Schofield and Sebastian who appeared to be more opposite Schofield than Christian who was to one side. That distance was bridged when Schofield lunged at Sebastian and grabbed him by the throat and then forced him to the ground, at which stage it appears other uniformed men moved in to control him physically. Christian moved towards Schofield and Sebastian while the former still appears to be restraining Sebastian in the vicinity of his upper body. It is apparent that Christian is verbally remonstrating with Schofield when the latter seizes him by the arm and commences throwing him to the ground. Although this does not appear from the still photographs, it is uncontroversial that in the course of this incident Schofield grabbed Christian's head and slammed it into the ground as well as slapping his face two or three times with the back of his hand, causing his lip to bleed. 

13The second factual matter concerns the question of the criminal proceedings against Schofield. His Honour said in this respect: 

""I also take into consideration the fact that the second defendant was prosecuted for assault on both plaintiffs and found guilty of those offences in the local court. The second defendant appealed to the District Court and the conviction in respect of Christian was quashed. The finding of guilt in respect of Sebastian was confirmed, but his conviction was quashed pursuant to the provisions of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Nevertheless, such matters remain on the criminal record of the second defendant and in that sense could be regarded as a punishment as a result of the events of that evening ."" (emphasis added) 

14There was no evidence at trial about any criminal proceedings against Schofield. Mr Thompson, who appeared for the appellants at trial, sought to tender records produced by the District Court which appear to have related to some such proceedings but counsel for the respondents objected and the tender was rejected. The primary judge's statements in the judgment concerning Schofield's prosecution appear to have been drawn in part from the debate which took place surrounding the unsuccessful tender, although I would note that the matter I have emphasised in quoting his Honour's statement was not referred to during that debate. 

15It should also be noted that the respondents did not rely at trial on any suggestion that there had been criminal proceedings against Schofield as a reason for defeating the exemplary damages claims. The written and oral submissions record that the respondents sought to meet that claim by relying on the propositions that such damages are rarely awarded and the appellants' conduct prior to the assault should be taken into account. 

16The third factual matter concerns the primary judge's reference to Schofield having been subject to disciplinary proceedings. 

17There was some, albeit scant, evidence of what Rail Corporation New South Wales (""RailCorp"") did in relation to Schofield in relation to the incident. On 18 March 2004 RailCorp wrote to Schofield referring to ""a report of [his] behaviour towards two (2) customers at Gosford Station on 13 th March 2004 at approximately 4.00am"" and advising him he was temporarily suspended with pay until further notice, while a Disciplinary Investigation was conducted. In April 2004 a ""Report of a Preliminary Inquiry into and Incident at Gosford Station involving Transit Officers"" found that ""[t]he evidence supports a finding that STO Schofield appears to have breached the Code of Workplace Standards by assaulting both Sebastian and Christian Whitbread."" The report recommended: 

""STO Schofield is advised in writing of the particulars of the alleged breaches of the Code of Workplace Standards pertaining to his alleged assaults on Sebastian and Christian Whitbread and a written response sought. On receipt of the written response, STO Schofield should be requested to attend a Disciplinary Interview. A determination should then be made as to what disciplinary action, if any, is required."" (emphasis in original) 

18There was no evidence as to what, if anything, happened in relation to this recommendation. There was no evidence that Schofield was subjected to any formal disciplinary proceedings. Finally I would note, again, that it does not appear from the written or oral submissions at trial that the respondents relied upon there having been any such proceedings to defeat the exemplary damages claims. 

Legal Principles 

19Exemplary damages are awarded ""as a punishment to the guilty, to deter from any such proceeding for the future, and as a proof of the detestation of the jury to the action itself"": Wilkes v Wood [1763] EngR 103; (1763) Lofft 1 (at 19) (98 ER 489, at 498-499) per Pratt LCJ cited with approval in the joint judgment in Lamb v Cotogno [1987] HCA 47; (1987) 164 CLR 1 (at 8). Such damages will be awarded where a defendant engages in conduct ""variously described as 'wanton and malicious', as 'conscious wrongdoing in contumelious disregard of the plaintiff's rights', as 'outrageous', 'atrocious', 'vindictive', 'arrogant', 'high handed' or 'insolent' "": Lamb v Cotogno (at 3). While ""it may be doubted whether a single formula adequately describes the boundaries of the field in which they may properly be awarded. ... the phrase ... of 'conscious wrongdoing in contumelious disregard of another's rights' describes at least the greater part of the relevant field"": Gray v Motor Accident Commission [1998] HCA 70; (1998) 196 CLR 1 (at [14]) per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. 

20Exemplary damages are awarded rarely. Something more must be found than a mere finding of fault: Gray (at [12]). The remedy is exceptional in the sense that it arises (chiefly, if not exclusively) in cases of conscious wrongdoing in contumelious disregard of the plaintiff's rights: Gray (at [20]). The intent or recklessness necessary to justify an award of exemplary damages may be found in contumelious behaviour which falls short of being malicious or is not aptly described by the use of that word: Lamb v Cotogno (at 13). 

21In considering whether to award exemplary damages ""the first, if not the principal, focus of the inquiry is upon the wrongdoer, not upon the party who was wronged"": Gray (at [15]; (at [31]) ""the conduct of the wrongdoer is central to that enquiry"") per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. In contradistinction, in the case of aggravated damages the assessment is made from the point of view of the plaintiff: State of New South Wales v Ibbett [2005] NSWCA 445; (2005) 65 NSWLR 168 (at [83]) per Spigelman CJ; referred to with approval in New South Wales v Ibbett [2006] HCA 57; (2006) 229 CLR 638 (at [34]). 

22An illustration of the extent to which an award of exemplary damages focuses on the wrongdoer can be seen in passages from two English decisions both cited with approval in New South Wales v Ibbett (at [39] - [40]). The first is by Lord Devlin in Rookes v Barnard [1964] UKHL 1; [1964] AC 1129. His Lordship, as the High Court observed, ""was no supporter of the general use of [the] remedy"" of exemplary damages. However he said, in Rookes v Barnard (at 1223), that he would not wish ""to diminish its use in this type of case where it serves a valuable purpose in restraining the arbitrary and outrageous use of executive power"" and (at 1226) that such damages should be awarded in the case of ""oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by the servants of the government"". His Lordship contrasted the law's attitude to an abuse of power by a private citizen to that by a servant of the government: 

""Where one man is more powerful than another, it is inevitable that he will try to use his power to gain his ends; and if his power is much greater than the other's, he might perhaps be said to be using it oppressively. If he uses his power illegally, he must of course pay for his illegality in the ordinary way; but he is not to be punished simply because he is the more powerful. In the case of the government it is different, for the servants of the government are also the servants of the people and the use of their power must always be subordinate to their duty of service."" 

23The second decision is Kuddus v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Constabulary [2001] UKHL 29; [2002] 2 AC 122 in which Lord Hutton discussed Lord Devlin's statement in Rookes v Barnard concerning the valuable purpose served by an award of exemplary damages and concluded: 

""[75] ... I think that a number of cases decided by the courts in Northern Ireland during the past 30 years of terrorist violence give support to the opinion of Lord Devlin in Rookes v Barnard [1964] AC 1129, 1223, 1226 that in certain cases the awarding of exemplary damages serves a valuable purpose in restraining the arbitrary and outrageous use of executive power and in vindicating the strength of the law. Members of the security forces seeking to combat terrorism face constant danger and have to carry out their duties in very stressful conditions. In such circumstances an individual soldier or police officer or prison officer may, on occasion, act in gross breach of discipline and commit an unlawful act which is oppressive or arbitrary and in such cases exemplary damages have been awarded. 

... 

[79] In my opinion the power to award exemplary damages in such cases serves to uphold and vindicate the rule of law because it makes clear that the courts will not tolerate such conduct. It serves to deter such actions in future as such awards will bring home to officers in command of individual units that discipline must be maintained at all times."" 

24Lord Hutton's remarks, as was pointed out in New South Wales v Ibbett (at [52]), were to similar effect as Priestly JA's statement in Adams v Kennedy [2000] NSWCA 152; (2000) 49 NSWLR 78 (at [36]) when delivering the principal reasons: 

""That figure [of exemplary damages] should indicate my view that the conduct of the [police officer] defendants was reprehensible, [and] mark the court's disapproval of it. The amount should also be such as to bring home to those officials of the State who are responsible for the overseeing of the police force that police officers must be trained and disciplined so that abuses of the kind that occurred in the present case do not happen."" 

25After referring to the fact that a like approach to that of Priestley JA and Lord Hutton had been taken in Peeters v Canada (1993) 108 DLR (4th) 471, the plurality held ( New South Wales v Ibbett ( at [54])) that the approach taken in cases such as Adams and Peeters should be accepted. 

Characterising Schofield's conduct 

26In finding that Schofield assaulted the appellants, the primary judge said: 

""I am satisfied that the aggressor in the situation was ... Schofield. Without warning to either of the plaintiffs, or indeed the other transit officers present, he lunged at Sebastian, connecting with his throat and neck ... No physical violence at that point, or before, had been offered by either plaintiff. They were surrounded by transit officers ... I am of the view that the defendants were entitled to remove the plaintiffs from the railway property. I am of the view, however, that the second defendant, Transit Officer Schofield, assaulted both plaintiffs in the course of the removal process. There was no necessity for such a violent reaction. The plaintiffs were clearly outnumbered and it seems to me they could have been physically escorted and restrained without the necessity for the violence exhibited by the second defendant. "" 

27Further, in considering both appellants' aggravated damages claims, the primary judge found that Schofield's conduct was ""high-handed"". His Honour found that the assault on Sebastian was ""a frightening experience"" which was ""unnecessary and unjustified"". Insofar as Christian's claim was concerned, his Honour found that Schofield's conduct in striking him in the face and slamming his head into the ground was ""inappropriate and regarded as such by a number of transit officers"". 

28Conduct which attracts the epithet ""high-handed"" falls within that class described as demonstrating a contumelious disregard of the plaintiff's rights which would attract an award of exemplary damages: Lamb v Cotogno (at 3); Fontin v Katapodis [1962] HCA 63; (1962) 108 CLR 177 (at 187) per Owen J; Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd [1966] HCA 40; (1966) 117 CLR 118 (at 130 ) per Taylor J; (at 146) per Menzies J; (at 161) per Owen J. It is not to point that the primary judge attached that description to Schofield's conduct when considering the aggravated damages claim. The same circumstances might justify either an award of exemplary or aggravated damages: Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd (at 130) per Taylor J; referred to with approval in New South Wales v Ibbett (at [33] - [34]). The same facts may be relevant to both heads of damage because of the different focus of each award: State of New South Wales v Ibbett (at [83]) per Spigelman CJ. 

29There was, in my view, ample evidence to conclude that Schofield's conduct in striking each appellant demonstrated conscious wrongdoing in contumelious disregard of another's rights. This may, in my view, be concluded from the primary judge's characterisation of him as the aggressor and his conduct as high-handed, unnecessary, unjustified and inappropriate. While the appellants had behaved objectionably throughout the evening in verbal exchanges with the respondents, they had not given any indication that they were moving to a physical confrontation. Their stance, as the primary judge found, did not reveal any act physical violence. 

30Schofield was in a position of power and, in my view, he abused that position. It is not, with respect, in my view sufficient to excuse his conduct on the basis that he ""simply lost his temper"": cf Whealey JA (at [228]). No doubt that was true of the defendant in Lamb v Cotogno but that did not deprive the plaintiff of an award of exemplary damages - although the plaintiff's conduct led to a reduction of the award in Fontin . Schofield was required to subordinate his power to his duty of service - no matter how unpalatable that notion may have been to him in the circumstances in which he found himself - and to restrain his anger. As the extracts from Kuddus (above) and Pettigrew v Northern Ireland Office [1990] NI 179 (below) demonstrate, courts in the United Kingdom have found persons in similar positions to Schofield with power and responsibility to ensure the keeping of the peace, liable for awards of exemplary damages for reacting violently in situations far more stressful I venture to say than that in which Schofield found himself on 13 March 2004. The community is entitled to expect those charged with the power of keeping the peace in public places exercise that power in a disciplined manner, notwithstanding their exposure to stressful behaviour from members of the public. 

31Prima facie, therefore, in my view each appellant was entitled to an award of exemplary damages in respect of Schofield's assault upon him. 

32I turn to consider whether that conclusion should be displaced by any of the maters of defeasance to which the primary judge referred: provocation by the appellants and criminal and/or disciplinary proceedings against Schofield. 

Provocation 

33An award of exemplary damages may be mitigated or reduced if it is found that the plaintiff has provoked the assault and battery complained of: Fontin v Katapodis (at 184) per McTiernan J. 

34That a court should not readily conclude that a plaintiff has provoked a violent assault can be seen from two cases. In Lamb v Cotogno the High Court rejected a challenge to an award of exemplary damages notwithstanding that the defendant's assault of the plaintiff was a reaction to being pursued by the latter who was threatening to kill him. 

35In Kuddus , Lord Hutton illustrated the circumstances in which exemplary damages may be awarded notwithstanding considerable provocation by reference to his decision in Pettigrew v Northern Ireland Office as follows: 

""77. In Pettigrew v Northern Ireland Office [1990] NI 179 there had been a mass escape of convicted terrorist prisoners from H Block 7 in the Maze Prison. In the course of the escape one prison officer died, one prison officer in H Block 7 was shot in the head and seriously wounded and other prison officers were injured. When the prisoners escaped from H Block 7 they left a number of prison officers tied up. It was clear that some of the prisoners who remained in H Block 7 had helped in varying degrees those who succeeded in escaping. After the escape the remaining prisoners in H Block 7 were moved to H Block 8. 

78. The plaintiff, who was one of the remaining prisoners moved to H Block 8, brought an action against the Northern Ireland Office for damages for assault and battery by prison officers, alleging that in the course of the move he had been kicked and punched by prison officers and that prison officers who were dog-handlers had not restrained their dogs from nipping and biting him. In the High Court it was held that it was probable that prison officers, angered by the death of a colleague and the wounding of other colleagues in the course of the escape, had given vent to their anger by kicking or punching the plaintiff and that dog handlers had failed adequately to restrain their dogs. The plaintiff was awarded exemplary damages and I refer, if I may, to what I said in giving judgment, at pp 181-182: 

'In this case I consider that the conduct of the dog handlers who deliberately did not restrain their dogs from nipping or biting the plaintiff and the conduct of the prison officers who kicked or punched the plaintiff was oppressive conduct by servants of the Government. Notwithstanding that the prison officers had real and understandable grounds for anger, it was their duty to restrain that anger, and in my opinion their conduct calls for an award of exemplary damages to mark the disapproval of the court, to teach that such conduct does not pay, and to act as a deterrent against this type of conduct against prisoners being repeated in the future.' "" (emphasis added) 

36Kuddus illustrates, in my view, that a court should be cautious about rejecting a claim for exemplary damages or reducing such an award in cases where the conduct ascribed to the plaintiff is of the very sort the defendant should expect to encounter and be equipped to handle in a disciplined manner. To accede too readily to such a submission has the potential of deflecting attention from the conduct of the wrongdoer to that of the victim. In civil proceedings provocation can be taken into account, as it was here, when considering a claim for aggravated damages where, as I have said, the assessment is made from the point of view of the plaintiff. 

37In my view the verbal abuse in which the appellants had engaged to varying degrees during the exchanges which preceded the assaults did not constitute provocation which should bar or reduce any award of exemplary damages - or, to put it in a way which focuses on Schofield's conduct - the appellants' conduct does not detract from the conclusion that the Court should mark its disapproval of Schofield's conduct by such an award. The two earlier incidents in which Schofield had interacted with the appellants had both been resolved, as Whealy JA has found (at [137]), ""relatively amicably"". Schofield had been present at the exchange which preceded the assaults for about three minutes before attacking. I do not accept that the evidence supported a conclusion that the appellants' conduct provoked a violent assault of the nature in which Schofield engaged. Further, insofar as Christian is concerned, apart from possibly swearing at a time when the brothers were told to leave the station to finish their drinks - a direction with which he complied - there was no evidence, in my view, that he had engaged in any conduct of a belligerent let alone provocative nature. At the moment Schofield struck Christian, he appeared from the still photographs to step forward to remonstrate verbally as one would expect a brother to do. Some of the transit officers did not even observe that. Rather, for example, Transit Officer Sidhu said: 

"" ... Schofield suddenly extended his right arm towards the neck of Sebastian, following which Sebastian fell backwards. He then saw Sinha and Borchard remove Sebastian. He then saw Schofield move towards Christian and move his hand in a backward action. He did not see the hand connect with Christian, but he fell down, straight away."" 

38Similarly, Transit Officer Singh said: 

""Schofield said something to Sebastian. He heard Sebastian reply something like, 'You can't touch me, I'll kill you.' He said that about fifteen or twenty seconds after Sebastian spoke to Schofield, Schofield raised his right hand and moved it towards Sebastian's upper chest area, He said he saw Sebastian move 'a little bit back'. He said he saw Schofield slap Christian two or three times with the back of his hand. He said that Christian started bleeding from the inside of the lip just after that. . He said he told Schofield, in relation to him hitting Christian, 'Don't do that.' He said that Schofield told him that Christian was grabbing his leg."" 

39It does not appear that Transit Officer Singh had observed anything which would warrant an assault on Christian. Other versions of the transit Officers statements are set out by Whealy JA (at [85]). None of them attribute belligerent behaviour to Christian. The highest it can be out in my view is that after Schofield struck his brother, Christian went to his brother's assistance and at some stage was hanging on to Schofield's leg (presumably to prevent him from attacking Sebastian again) - a position rendering him vulnerable to the assault Schofield then inflicted on him - rather than putting him in a position of threatening Schofield with harm. The primary judge did not regard Christian's conduct in hanging on to Schofield's leg as justifying Schofield's assault. 

Criminal proceedings 

40It is apparent from Gray (at [46]) that if criminal proceedings are to be relied upon to defeat a claim for exemplary damages, the defendant must prove the criminal charges, alleged the same conduct as alleged in the civil proceedings. That is what happened in Gray by the tender of the certificate of conviction of the wrongdoer and the sentencing remarks relating to him as evidence of the truth of their contents . 

41I have already observed that there was no evidence about the criminal proceedings in relation to Schofield. However the appeal was conducted on the basis that the primary judge did not err in his recitation of the facts surrounding such proceedings, but did err by having regard to Schofield's prosecution itself and him being found guilty in the Local Court. The appellants complained that a prosecution per se is not a penalty and, further that even if Schofield was convicted in the Local Court, on appeal from the conviction in respect of Sebastian he was dealt with pursuant to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Under that provision the court does not proceed to a conviction even though it finds a person guilty of an offence. It has three options as to what order it may make in such circumstance. Nothing in the Court's papers indicates what course was taken in Schofield's case in this respect. 

42Insofar as Christian was concerned the primary judge concluded that Schofield's conviction was ""quashed"". Quite what that meant was not apparent. On an appeal to the District Court from a Local Court conviction, the District Court has a range of powers including setting aside the conviction: s 20(1)(a), Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). I will assume that this is what the primary judge was referring to. If the conviction was set aside, prima facie it would appear that Schofield was acquitted - a conclusion which accords with Whealy JA's (at [234]). I shall return to the significance of this. 

43The plurality concluded in Gray (at [40]) that exemplary damages may not be awarded where, as in that case, the criminal law had been brought to bear upon the wrongdoer and substantial punishment inflicted. It was not difficult to conclude in Gray that substantial punishment had been inflicted upon the wrongdoer who had been convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to the plaintiff and was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. Moreover the Court was able to discern whether the facts which formed the basis for the wrongdoer's conviction and sentence were those relied on in the civil proceedings because, as i have said, the certificate of his conviction and the sentencing remarks relating to him were tendered by consent of the parties as evidence of the truth of their contents: Gray (at [2]) . Because there was no doubt about the severity of the wrongdoer's punishment, the plurality did not (at [44]) find it ""necessary to decide whether the bar arises only where the punishment is 'substantial' or how close must be the similarity between the conduct that is the subject of the two proceedings."" However it is clear that to raise the bar the plurality judgment contemplated (at [40]), it must be possible to determine the wrongdoer has suffered ""substantial punishment"" and that there is "" 'substantial identity' between the conduct that is the subject of the criminal and civil proceedings"": Gray (at [45]). 

44The plurality referred to, but did not determine, what may be the consequences in cases where the question whether ""substantial punishment"" had been imposed was debateable, or there was, in effect, a plea bargain or only a nominal penalty was imposed. Their Honours did not leave lower courts entirely in the dark on such matters however. They pointed out (at [46]) that: 

""if criminal charges, alleging the same conduct as is alleged in a civil proceeding, have been brought and proved, it would be a most unusual case in which it was open to a civil court to conclude that the outcome of those criminal proceedings did not take sufficient account of the need to punish the offender and deter others from like conduct..."" (emphasis added) 

45It is significant, in my view, that the plurality clearly regarded the fact the criminal charges were proven, without referring to any punishment imposed, as debarring a civil court save in exceptional circumstances from itself imposing an award of damages which was punitive in nature. Similar reasoning can be seen in the Privy Council's decision in W v W [1999] 2 NZLR 1, an appeal from the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Daniels v Thompson [1998] 3 NZLR 22, to which I refer below. In W v W (at 3), Lord Hoffman, in delivering the judgment of their Lordships said: 

""... [T]here can be no doubt that allowing an action for exemplary damages to follow or precede a criminal punishment carries the risk that a person may be punished twice for the same offence. ... [P]rima facie it must be assumed that the criminal punishment was considered by the Court to be appropriate to the offence and the offender. To award exemplary damages at all would imply that the civil Court thought that the criminal punishment had been inadequate. There is an additional problem when a criminal prosecution follows a civil action. Logically, the criminal punishment should take into account the exemplary damages which have been awarded but there is an argument for regarding criminal proceedings in the name of the state as having primacy over a private action."" (emphasis added) 

46The plurality also observed (at [46]) that ""[o]ther considerations may well arise if relevant criminal proceedings ended in the accused's acquittal"". Their Honours did not deal with those considerations but referred in a footnote to that paragraph to Daniels v Thompson (at 50 - 52) per Richardson P, Gault, Henry and Keith JJ; and to Thomas J's dissenting reasons (at 77). 

47Daniels v Thompson concerned the question whether an action for exemplary damages could lie where the allegations forming the basis of a claim for exemplary damages constituted criminal offending. In particular, the court considered whether an action for exemplary damages was barred where the defendant had already been convicted and punished in respect of the same conduct in criminal proceedings or had been acquitted in the criminal jurisdiction of a charge arising from the acts which formed the basis of the claim or where there was the commencement of, but no concluded, criminal prosecution. 

48Relevantly, the Court held (Richardson P, Gault, Henry and Keith JJ, Thomas J dissenting) that that a claim for exemplary damages should be struck out as an abuse of process if the defendant had been acquitted and essentially the same acts which constituted the criminal offending were relied upon in the civil proceedings. The Court undertook an extensive review of authorities in Australia, the United Kingdom (where the right to exemplary damages was substantially curtailed by the decision in Rookes v Barnard ), the United States and Canada. The plurality concluded (at 45) that no clear common line of authority was discernible and that there was a divergence of approach, as to both result and rationale. 

49Insofar as the consequences of an acquittal were concerned, the plurality regarded the issue as ""not free from difficulty"", but concluded that it seemed ""that where the criminal process has exonerated a person from alleged offending, then it becomes undesirable to allow what are substantially the same issues of fact to be relitigated for the sole purpose of exacting a punishment for their commission."" Such relitigation would, in the plurality's view, offend the finality principle, and was inconsistent with the recognised purposes of the administration of justice: Daniels v Thompson (at 51). 

50As Thomas J wrote in his dissenting reasons (at 55 - 56), the decision of the plurality was reached largely as a matter of public policy by according ""[t]he role of the state in dealing with criminal conduct ... primacy, which is absolute where the defendant has been convicted, and effectively exclusive where he or she has been acquitted or could be liable to a criminal prosecution."" His Honour preferred ""a less radical approach"" which, while accepting that an award of exemplary damages would be exceptional, would not impose an absolute bar on such a claim where the defendant has been convicted of an offence involving the same conduct, or which was part of the same conduct but would take into account the defendant's punishment in the criminal proceeding in determining whether an award of exemplary damages was appropriate. His Honour was reinforced in his view by the fact that it accorded with law reform commission reports completed after extensive consultation and review of authority: the Ontario Law Reform Commission, Report on Exemplary Damages (1991) and the Law Commission for England and Wales Consultation Paper no 132, Aggravated, Exemplary and Restitutionary Damages: A Consultation Paper , (1993) (LCCP No 132) which led to the report of the Law Commission for England and Wales, Aggravated, Exemplary and Restitutionary Damages, (LAW COM No 247). 

51An appeal to the Privy Council from the decision in Daniels v Thompson was dismissed ( W v W ) in part because the Board took the view it would not substitute its own views (if different) on a matter of the policy of the law in a particular country. However the Board also considered the effect of an acquittal because the appellant submitted that the Court of Appeal's decision in that respect displayed an error of principle. In this respect the Board said (at 5): 

"" It was argued that in the case of an acquittal, which may have been on technical grounds, there can be no question of double punishment. The accused has not been punished in the criminal Court at all. This is of course true, but Their Lordships consider that a need for consistency leads inexorably to the conclusion that an acquittal should also bar the civil remedy for exemplary damages. The decision to bar the remedy after conviction and punishment is plainly a matter of policy and the consistent application of such a policy requires that it should apply irrespective of the severity or lightness of the punishment imposed by the criminal Court. In each case, it will be the punishment which that Court considered appropriate to the offence and the offender and it should not be reconsidered by another Court. This must be the case even when the sentence is an absolute discharge. Having got to that point, Their Lordships consider that it would be illogical to bar an action against an accused who has been convicted and discharged but not against an accused who has been acquitted. Their Lordships think it would be impractical in this context to try to distinguish between technical acquittals and acquittals on the merits."" 

52This Court considered Daniels v Thompson in Niven v SS [2006] NSWCA 338. In that case the respondent commenced civil proceedings against the appellant alleging that when he was approximately 13 years old and in Year 7 at Bombala State High School, he was indecently assaulted several times by the appellant at his house in Bombala over a period of time. After those proceedings were commenced the appellant was charged with some 19 offences with respect to the respondent alleged to have taken place between 1 May 1997 and 30 September 1997, of which five were for aggravated sexual offence pursuant to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), three for aggravated indecent assault pursuant to s 61M(1) of the same Act and one for incite person aged under 16 years to commit an act of indecency pursuant to s 61N(1) of that Act (the criminal proceedings). The assaults the subject of the criminal proceedings were relevantly identical to those the subject of the civil proceedings: Niven (at [6]). 

53The criminal proceedings had not been listed for hearing at the time the civil proceedings came on for hearing. The trial judge rejected an application for a stay of the civil proceedings until after the completion of the committal hearing. He then heard the case, accepted the respondent's evidence that he had been sexually assaulted by the appellant on at least five occasions and assessed damages in the sum of $386,000 which included an award of $60,000 by way of exemplary damages. 

54On appeal the appellant submitted that the award for exemplary damages was bad in law, being contrary to the principle that exemplary damages should not be awarded if the defendant has already been punished in criminal proceedings - a principle it was submitted that should be extended to situations where the defendant was facing criminal prosecution and hence the possibility of punishment: Niven (at [46]). 

55In the course of the appeal in Niven , it emerged that the appellant had been acquitted in the criminal proceedings of the charges which concerned his conduct in respect of the respondent. He submitted that the Court should apply the second principle established in Daniels and strike out as an abuse of process the claim for exemplary damages having regard to his acquittal of essentially the same conduct in a criminal proceeding - even though the acquittal occurred after the conclusion of the civil trial: see Niven (at [60]). 

56Tobias JA (with whom Beazley and Giles JJA agreed) rejected that submission. His Honour was not prepared to accede to the appellant's submission ""that this Court should, as a matter of policy, apply by analogy the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Daniels as affirmed by the Privy Council in W v W to strike out or dismiss a claim for exemplary damages where the appellant has been acquitted of the charges preferred against him subsequent to the conclusion of the civil trial at which exemplary damages were awarded."" In his Honour's view ""the appellant having been acquitted of the charges preferred against him in the criminal proceedings, no question of double punishment [arose] and [t]here is no possibility of any punishment"" : Niven (at [63]). 

57Tobias JA regarded the whole tenor of the High Court's approach in Gray to the award of exemplary damages as consistent with his conclusion, even though the Court in Gray ""was at one with the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Daniels in concluding that exemplary damages should not be awarded in a civil trial where the defendant, in a preceding criminal trial, had had inflicted upon him or her 'substantial punishment'"" (at [64]). He noted that ""[e]ven in Gray , the Court left for another occasion the meaning of 'substantial punishment' particularly if only a nominal penalty for reasons personal to the accused or other reasons had been imposed in the criminal proceedings."" 

58Niven is a recent decision of this Court from which I would not depart. I do not regard it as ""plainly wrong"" or even erroneous: Gett v Tabet [2009] NSWCA 76; (2009) 254 ALR 504. On that basis, and on the premise that Schofield was acquitted in respect of the assault on Christian, the fact of the criminal proceedings against Schofield was irrelevant to Christian's claim for exemplary damages. 

59It is not necessary to reach a final decision concerning the effect of an acquittal on Christian's claim for exemplary damages. The question was not really canvassed on appeal - one reason being the uncertainty surrounding the effect of the ""quashing"" of Schofield's conviction in respect of Christian. As is apparent from Daniels , the issue is fraught with difficult decisions of policy and conflicting authority in the common law world. It is a question the High Court should resolve: cf Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; (2007) 230 CLR 89 (at [134]). 

60The relevance of any criminal proceedings for both appellants' claims can, in my view, be resolved on a factual basis. The unsatisfactory position concerning the evidence about any criminal proceedings against Schofield means the Court cannot determine whether there was ""substantial identity"" between the conduct that may have been the subject of the criminal and civil proceedings: Gray (at [45]). The primary judge merely recorded that Schofield was ""prosecuted for assault on both plaintiffs"" without any reference to the factual basis for the charges. As the plurality made clear from their reference to the fact that the ""substantial identity"" issue ""may lead to difficult questions of fact and degree"", this is a relevant factual inquiry. It was not undertaken in this case. In my view this means it is not open to the Court to conclude that any criminal charges against Schofield in respect of either Sebastian or Christian alleged ""the same conduct"" as was alleged in the present proceedings: Gray (at [46]). Nor is the Court aware whether Schofield was punished at all. The primary judge may have been aware from experience which entitled him to take judicial notice of the fact that a s 10 order remains on a person's record, however it is not apparent that that would take the significance of a conclusion as to a conviction which did not proceed to a finding of guilt any further. 

61In those circumstances I would not regard whatever criminal proceedings were taken against Schofield as militating against an award of exemplary damages. 
Disciplinary proceedings 

62As I have said, there was evidence that Schofield had been subjected suspension with pay pending an investigation of the incident. There was no evidence that there was any follow-up on the recommendation that disciplinary action be considered following an interview with Schofield. There was no evidence that he had suffered any financial penalty, been reduced in rank, or dismissed from RailCorp in a way which might warrant the conclusion that he had been ""punished"" albeit in a civil context: cf Police Service Board v Morris [1985] HCA 9; (1985) 156 CLR 397 (at 404). 

63In my view there was no evidence of disciplinary action which would affect any award of exemplary damages. 

Quantum of award 

64The principles as to the quantum of an award of exemplary damages were conveniently collected in James v Hill [2004] NSWCA 301 (at [66] ff) per Tobias JA (Sheller and Hodgson JJA agreeing). Relevantly (at [69]) the ""objectives of an award of exemplary damages are to punish the wrongdoer, deter him and others from committing like conduct again, to provide vindication to the victim and to denounce the wrongdoer's behaviour."" 

65If exemplary damages are to fulfil their threefold purpose, they must not merely irritate, they must sting; there is ""no necessary proportionality"" between the amount awarded as compensation for the damage suffered by the plaintiff and the amount of exemplary damages awarded against the defendant: Harris v Digital Pulse Pty Limited [2003] NSWCA 10; (2003) 56 NSWLR 298 (at [254]) per Heydon JA; cited in Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (No 2) (2003) 57 NSWCA 338 (at [23]); James v Hill (at [84]). 

66Having regard to these principles, and bearing in mind the focus of the award is the wrongdoer's conduct, I would award each appellant $10,000 by way of exemplary damages. 

Aggravated damages 

67The primary judge awarded the appellants aggravated damages but took into consideration what he said ""could be described as the provocative behaviour of the plaintiffs and their belligerence in assessing such an award..."". The appellants challenged that factual conclusion. For the reasons I have given, that submission should be accepted. 

68As Whealy JA has explained (at [235]) aggravated damages may be reduced if the plaintiff's own behaviour may have brought the attack on himself. This proposition is drawn from Fontin v Katapodis and appears to depend on understanding the references in that case to exemplary damages included aggravated damages. That is because it was only in Rookes v Barnard that the distinction between aggravated and exemplary damages was explained and accepted in Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd : see Halsbury's, Laws of Australia , LexisNexis at [135-605]. 

69As I have explained, in my view the appellants' conduct was not responsible for the commission of the tortious act: Fontin v Katapodis (at 187) per Owen J (with whom Dixon CJ agreed). Accordingly I would increase each appellant's award of aggravated damages to $7,500. 

Conclusion 

70The effect of my reasons is that Sebastian's damages should be increased to $22,500 and Christian's to $25,000. These amounts exceed in total the amounts in the Offers of Compromise upon which the primary judge based his decision to award RailCorp indemnity costs from 16 October 2007 and the amounts in RailCorp's second offers of compromise of 6 February 2008. I do not understand it to have been suggested that the offer of $100,000 plus costs made on the first day of the trial apparently as a joint offer was relied upon in a Calderbank sense so as to entitle RailCorp to indemnity costs. However the exemplary damages component of the damages should only be awarded against Schofield, although they are damages RailCorp accepted in this Court that it would pay: appeal transcript, 14 February 2011, at 31. That means, however, that the verdict against RailCorp in respect of Sebastian would be less than the offer of compromise in respect of him made on 16 October 2007, but still more than that made to Christian. The verdict against Schofield would be less than the offers. In those circumstances and also because RailCorp said in its written submission it wished to be heard on the appropriate basis on which costs should be ordered, I would propose to reserve the position as to both the question of the costs of the trial and the appeal. As, however, this is a dissenting judgment, I have not made any directions about service of submissions addressing the issues raised by my reasons. 

71I propose the following orders: 
(1) Appeal allowed in part. 

(2) Set aside the judgment for $10,000 in favour of the first appellant and in lieu thereof order that there be a verdict against the first respondent in the amount of $12,500 and in the amount of $22,000 against the second respondent. 

(3) Set aside the judgment for $12,000 in favour of the second appellant and in lieu thereof order that there be a verdict against the first respondent in the amount of $15,000 and further in the amount of $25,000 against the second respondent. 

(4) Costs of the trial and appeal reserved. 

(5) Parties to calculate the interest component of the damages. 

72WHEALY JA : Two brothers, Sebastian and Christian Whitbread, were involved in an incident at Gosford Railway Station in the early hours of the morning of Saturday 13 March 2004. The incident involved a confrontation between the two brothers and a number of State Rail transit officers. The brothers had been drinking heavily for some hours and undoubtedly were well affected by alcohol. In the upshot, the brothers were arrested and taken to Gosford Police Station by local police where they were detained for some hours. Infringement notices were issued to the brothers upon their release, alleging breaches of railway regulations. The breaches alleged misconduct of one kind or another on railway land. Later, however, these notices were withdrawn and one of the transit officers, Andrew Schofield, was prosecuted for assaults committed against the brothers. They, in turn, brought proceedings in the District Court of New South Wales seeking damages against Rail Corporation New South Wales (""RailCorp"") and a number of the transit officers, including Schofield. Each brother was the plaintiff in separate proceedings seeking damages for assault and battery, false imprisonment and injurious falsehood. Each brother claimed general damages, aggravated damages, exemplary damages, interest and costs. 

73The two proceedings were heard together by O'Connor DCJ during early February 2008. On 14 October 2008, his Honour delivered his final judgment on liability and damages. He found in favour of each plaintiff on the assault count, insofar as it related to the actions of Schofield. RailCorp had agreed that, in the event of a finding against any of its employees, it would accept a finding against it based on vicarious liability. Consequently, the judge awarded $10,000 damages to Sebastian against RailCorp and Schofield. Christian was awarded $12,000 against the same two defendants. The trial judge, however, held against the brothers in relation to the false imprisonment and injurious falsehood claims. Each of the remaining employees who had been unsuccessfully sued received a verdict in his favour. 

74The trial judge gave a second decision on 17 November 2008. This related to the costs of the proceedings. The position had been complicated by the fact that there had been offers of compromise made on two separate occasions during the proceedings. Ultimately, RailCorp and Schofield were ordered to pay Sebastian's costs on an ordinary basis up to 17 October 2007. However, Sebastian was ordered to pay those two defendants' costs on an indemnity basis from 17 October 2007. Similarly, RailCorp and Schofield were ordered to pay Christian's costs on an ordinary basis up to 7 February 2008. Christian, however, was ordered to pay those two defendants' costs on an indemnity basis from 11am on 7 February 2008. 

75His Honour, in the exercise of his discretion, declined to make a Bullock or Sanderson order in relation to the costs awarded against the plaintiffs in favour of the successful transit officers. 

76Each brother sought leave to appeal from the decisions of the trial judge. Leave was granted by this Court on 20 November 2009. Thereafter, Amended Notices of Appeal were filed and the matter was ultimately prepared for hearing. For reasons that are not necessary to detail, there are now only four respondents to Sebastian's appeal, they being RailCorp, Andrew Schofield, John Borchard and Christopher Sanderson. In Christian's appeal, the remaining respondents, in addition to RailCorp, are Schofield, Borchard and Sanderson, together with another employee, Geoffrey Blight. 

77The appeals were heard together on 14 and 15 February 2011. Maurice Neil QC and Mark Thompson appeared for each appellant. The respondents were represented by David Hooke SC and David Sulan. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court reserved its decision. 

An examination of the events of 13 March 2004 

78Many of the circumstances surrounding the incident at Gosford Railway Station are not in dispute. Indeed, a large number of the facts found by the trial judge are not now in dispute. That said, there are some 10 to 12 factual matters where it will be necessary for this Court to determine whether the particular findings were open, available and justified on the evidence. Subject to the resolution of those matters, I will state briefly my general understanding of the facts and, in the context of the actual confrontation at the railway station and its immediate aftermath, refer extensively to the trial judge's description and analysis of those particular factual matters. Throughout this narrative, and generally, I will for convenience refer to the plaintiffs by their first names. I will again for convenience, refer to the relevant transit officers simply by reference to their respective surnames. 

79The origins of the incident can be traced back to events in the early evening of Friday 12 March 2004. The two brothers went to the Wyong RSL Club to watch a rugby league game. They arrived roughly between 6:30pm and 7:00pm, and left about 10:00pm or 10:30pm. Sebastian, who was 23 years of age at the time, had about seven schooners of beer while he was at the club. Christian, who was some three years younger, said that, in general terms, he matched his brother ""drink for drink"" at the club, even though he, Christian, was a slower drinker than his older brother. 

80The brothers then left the RSL Club and caught a train from Wyong to Gosford. There they went to a nightclub called ""Joe's Garage"", played pool, drank some more and danced. They also played the poker machines and, it seems, between them they won about three hundred and fifty dollars. At the club, they drank a variety of mixed drinks. Sebastian thought he had had fifteen to twenty alcoholic drinks over the whole night. He was later to put his level of intoxication as ""about a 5 out of 10"". Christian had about twelve to fifteen drinks at the club and he was later to agree that his estimate of his level of intoxication at the time of the incident was that he was ""either a 9 or a 10 out of 10"". There is no doubt that they were both significantly affected by alcohol. 

81Christian had to be at work at McDonald's at Wyong on the Saturday morning at 6:00am. The brothers left the nightclub and arrived at the Gosford Railway Station some time between 3:30am and 4:00am. It seems they had determined that they would catch a train from Gosford back to their home suburb of Wyong. Sebastian had $300 in notes in his pocket together with some $7 or $8 dollars in small change. It also appears, from the evidence that Sebastian was later to give, that when the two men arrived at the railway station, Sebastian, at least, intended to travel on the train without paying for a ticket. This was so because he realised at the time that he only had, in general terms, fifty dollar notes on his person, and that would not enable him to get change from the ticket machine at the station. He also explained that, when the two men had travelled from Wyong to Gosford the night before, they did not buy a return ticket because they ""didn't have enough money at that stage"". Later, presumably at Gosford, Sebastian used an ATM to obtain an amount of cash for the purpose of funding the night out at Gosford. 

82Gosford Station straddles the railway line which proceeds, more or less, in a north-south direction. Mann Street is on the east side of the railway station, with an entry for pedestrians from the street. On the western side of the station is Showground Road. Again, there are facilities for pedestrians to enter the railway concourse from that western side. At concourse level there are offices, toilets, amenities, timetable details and the barriers. The platform may be reached by stairs and lifts, located on the eastern side of the barriers. These provided access to the lower level where the railway platforms are located. 

83The two men approached the railway station from the Mann Street side. They were carrying drinks with them when they arrived at the railway concourse. They were first spoken to by transit officers and then later were spoken to by a security guard. Requests were made that they take their drinks off the railway premises. They complied with this direction, although Sebastian said to the guard, ""You go your fucking way and I'll go my fucking way."" The brothers took their drinks out on to the Showground Road side of the station, that is on the western side of the railway complex. The brothers were also spoken to by some transit officers about the issue, and they remained out there drinking for a time until they had finished their drinks. The three transit officers involved in this discussion appeared to have been Schofield, Sinha and Jimenez. The empty bottles were left on the outside fence, near where the brothers had been drinking. When they came back into the concourse, it appears that Sebastian was smoking a cigarette. He was spoken to by Schofield, following which the cigarette was either put out or finished outside the concourse area. 

84I turn now to the findings of fact made by the trial judge. His Honour dealt with the events I have just described, and the situation which then developed. The extract commences as follows: 

""From the statements contained in exhibit H and the evidence of the plaintiffs there was little controversy about the following factual matters. The plaintiffs had attended a local nightclub at Gosford and other places previous to that where a considerable amount of intoxicating liquor was consumed. By the time they arrived at Gosford railway station they were well affected by alcohol and were continuing to drink from bottles thought to be Bacardi Breezers. 

They were observed as they entered the station by Transit Officers Sidhu and Singh. They were told to finish their drinks outside and then to enter the station. They complied with this direction saying, 'Yeah, yeah, fucking.' 

The plaintiffs were seen sitting on a seat outside a paper shop drinking alcohol on railway property at which time they were spoken to by a guard, Michael Riley, who told them to take their drinks off the premises. They complied with this direction, albeit unhappily, Sebastian saying, 'You go your fucking way and I'll go my fucking way.' 

They then moved to the Showground Road exit and finished their drinks, (exhibit H, attachment 7). This incident was witnessed by Lynette Truscott, who occupied the position of Customer Service Assistant at Gosford station. 

After the incident she spoke to the guard, telling him, 'Don't worry about them, they're full of alcohol.' Ms Truscott then went to the meal room. She said there were approximately eleven transit officers there. She warned them to be careful and she said one of the persons she had seen maybe looking for a 'blue'. 

Andrew Schofield, the second defendant, Kenneth Sinha, the sixth defendant, Melchor Jimenez, the fifth defendant, and Transit Officer Sinha on their patrol, observed the plaintiff Sebastian smoking a cigarette (exhibit H 16 paras 8-9), This observation was at the Showground Road exit. Schofield asked what they were doing, to which they responded they were having a drink and waiting to catch a train (exhibit H attachment 19 paras 5-6). They then entered the concourse at Gosford station. Sebastian was smoking a cigarette. 

Schofield directed him to put the cigarette out, with which direction he complied (exhibit H attachment 19, paras 5-7). 

It would appear to be common ground that there is no manned ticket booth open for the purchase of a ticket, no doubt having regard to the hour. There was no dispute that the plaintiffs had sufficient funds to purchase tickets if a ticket booth was manned, however most of their currency was in fifty dollar notes. 

Police records reveal that Sebastian had three hundred and seven dollars and ninety cents in his possession when taken into custody at Gosford police station. Seven dollars and ninety cents, it seems, was sufficient to purchase at least one ticket to Wyong at the automatic vending machine, but perhaps insufficient for two tickets. 

Sebastian's evidence was that on past occasions when confronted with a similar situation they had caught a train and paid a fine on termination of their journey. 

The plaintiffs entered the station and walked through the barriers leading to the platforms, where they were confronted by TO Sanderson (the fourth defendant) , who asked for their tickets, (exhibit H attachment 15). This episode is captured on CCTV (exhibit A). 

The CCTV demonstrates that the plaintiffs then withdrew behind the barriers. A discussion then ensued between the plaintiffs, and Transit Officer Sanderson, Transit Officer John Borchard, the third defendant and Transit Officer Geoffrey Blight, the seventh defendant were present. Transit Officer Sidhu and Transit Officer Singh were on the concourse, but a little further away. Transit Officer Sanderson recorded the conversation with the plaintiffs in his notebook. A typescript of the alleged conversation is included in exhibit H, in attachment 15. The conversation is described in the following terms: 

Sanderson: 'Have you got tickets?' 

Sebastian: 'There's nowhere to buy a fucking ticket.' 

Sanderson: 'There are ticket machines out there.' 

Sebastian: 'Fucking where? You get me a fucking machine that gives me change and I'll buy a ticket.' 

Sanderson: 'The machines give change.' 

Sebastian: 'Not the change I fucking want, I don't have to buy a ticket if the machine doesn't give me change.' 

Sanderson: 'It's up to you to make sure you have the money for the machine. State Rail has the responsibility of supplying machines but no responsibility for supplying the money.' 

Sebastian: 'Well can't fucking buy a ticket. I'm going without a ticket.' 

Sanderson: 'You aren't catching a train.' 

Sebastian: 'Yes, I fucking am and what are you going to do about it, what are you going to do to stop me.' 

Sanderson (to Christian): 'Mate you can go and by [sic] a ticket and catch a train if you want but he's not going down there.' 

Christian: 'I'm not going anywhere, he's my brother.' 

Sanderson: 'I'm an authorised officer, I'm giving you a direction to leave the station under the Rail Safety Act. I'm directing you to leave due to your offensive language.' 

Sebastian: 'You can't fucking make me.' 

Sanderson: 'Yes, I can. I'm giving you another direction, to leave the station. It's an offence not to comply with that direction. If you don't leave the station we'll have to grab you and take you out.' 

There is no dispute that Sebastian used the word 'fucking' on several occasions and that he was being directed to leave the station, and that both he and his brother refused to do so. 

As mentioned, it is not disputed that they were both intoxicated. Although Mr Thompson, in his submission, did not accept the accuracy of Mr Sanderson's account of the conversation, I accept on the balance of probabilities that fairly describes the exchange, bearing in mind it was contemporaneously recorded in his notebook and reflects the mood and the essential elements of the dispute. 

Also, no doubt as a result of the plaintiffs' intoxicated state, their memory of the details is somewhat vague. 

The ensuing scene is captured on CCTV, by which time the second defendant Schofield has arrived. The plaintiffs are then in the company of Schofield, Sanderson, Borchard, Blight and Sinha. Jimenez is seen to be leaning against the wall. 

There is nothing in the demeanour of those present to suggest imminent violence. Transit Officer Sanderson describes the subsequent events in the following terms. I have substituted 'Sebastian' for 'POI1' and 'Christian' for 'POI2', as it appears in his statement: 

Schofield: 'Mate, what's happening. I just spoke to you guys out there, you guys were going to behave yourselves.' Schofield said something else to Sebastian, then Sebastian became more aggressive and raised his voice at Schofield. Schofield said, 'Don't yell at me,' Then Sebastian said, 'I will fucking smash you.' Schofield then appeared to lunge towards Sebastian, striking him with his right hand to the male's chest or neck area. This caused the male to stumble backwards. STO Sinha and TO Bouchard then took hold of Sebastian and removed him from the station. Christian went to the ground and took hold of Schofield's leg. Schofield struck Christian with the back of his hand. Whilst the male had hold of Schofield's leg Schofield grabbed Christian's head with both hands and appeared to slam it into the ground. It released the grip Christian had on Schofield's leg. Schofield, Blight and I then carried Christian out."" 

85The trial judge then provided a summary of the relevant portions of the statements of a number of the transit officers. It should be noted that, unusually, all these statements had been tendered by the plaintiffs in their respective cases. For that reason, it became unnecessary for the defendants to call any of the officers. These statements came, inter alia, from Sidhu, Sinha, Jimenez, Singh, Borchard and Blight. I shall reproduce his Honour's remarks about the contents of these statements in full: 

""Transit Officer Sidhu described the events leading to the removal of the plaintiffs from the station. He said Schofield stood near Sanderson and started talking to the boys. He folded his arms. He said Schofield suddenly extended his right arm towards the neck of Sebastian, following which Sebastian fell backwards. He then saw Sinha and Borchard remove Sebastian. He then saw Schofield move towards Christian and move his hand in a backward action. He did not see the hand connect with Christian, but he fell down, straight away. In a matter of seconds he said he saw blood coming from Christian's lip, when being removed by Sanderson, Jimenez and Blight. 

Transit Officer Sinha provided a statement in which he said that Schofield got involved in the discussion with the males who were still swearing. He heard one of them say, 'There's no fucking way I'm leaving the station.' He heard Sanderson give the males directions to leave the station, however he said, 'The males continued to swear at the transit officers present'. He said he heard Schofield say something like, 'I've already told you boys to behave', but they continued to swear at him. He said he saw Schofield suddenly grab one of the males around the upper chest and neck area with his right hand and that the male fell backwards towards the glassed area. 

Transit Officer Jimenez provided a statement in which he said that he heard Sanderson giving directions to the males to leave the station and that they refused to comply with these directions. He said he heard Sebastian say something like , 'I will kill you fucking cunts, I'm not leaving the station.' He said this went on for five to seven minutes when suddenly Schofield extended his right arm towards Sebastian and pushed him below the neck area, causing him to move back a little. He said a scuffle then broke out and he did not see what happened to Sebastian. He said that Christian was on the ground and hanging onto Schofield's leg and that Schofield gave him a backhand on his face. He said he later saw blood on Christian's teeth. 

Transit Officer Singh provided a statement in which he said that Schofield joined the group consisting of Sanderson, Sinha, Borchard and Blight . Transit Officer Sinha and Melchor were standing a little bit away from that group. He said Sanderson, Borchard and Blight were talking to the males but were getting nowhere. He said Schofield said something to Sebastian. He heard Sebastian reply something like, 'You can't touch me, I'll kill you.' He said that about fifteen or twenty seconds after Sebastian spoke to Schofield, Schofield raised his right hand and moved it towards Sebastian's upper chest area, He said he saw Sebastian move 'a little bit back'. He said he saw Schofield slap Christian two or three times with the back of his hand. He said that Christian started bleeding from the inside of the lip just after that. He said he told Schofield, in relation to him hitting Christian, 'Don't do that.' He said that Schofield told him that Christian was grabbing his leg. Transit Officer Borchard provided a statement in which he said he heard Sanderson giving a direction to the plaintiff in the following terms, 'I am giving you a direction to leave, leave the station now.' Sebastian replied, 'I'm not fucking leaving, what are you going to do about it?' He said Sanderson replied, 'If you don't leave we will remove you.' He said Sebastian became more aggressive, speaking louder and louder. He said about this time Schofield arrived. He heard him say, 'I've already spoken to you two, you were going to behave yourselves.' He said he heard Sebastian say, 'I'm going to fucking smash you.' He said Schofield then pushed Sebastian away from himself with his right hand making contact with Sebastian's upper chest and throat, causing him to stumble backwards towards the glass or wall railing. 

Transit Officer Blight provided a statement. He heard Sanderson give a direction to both males to leave the station. He said that Sebastian responded aggressively on hearing this and started swearing again, stating that he was not going to leave 'the fucking station', and was going to get the train. He said Schofield arrived and said, 'What's going on here, I told you boys to behave yourself. You are going to have to leave the station.' He said that Sebastian started abusing him, 'giving him a mouthful'. He said he then saw Schofield lunge out with an open hand towards the neck area of Sebastian. He said that Sebastian fell backwards to the ground, at which point Christian tried to help his brother. He said in the confusion Sebastian fell on his back and he and Sanderson told him to stay down. He said that Christian grabbed Schofield around his lower leg and that Schofield told him to let go three times. After the third time Schofield hit Christian in the face area with an open backhand in what he described as a defensive action and he noticed blood on Christian's general mouth area after he was struck."" 

86I should interpolate that, during the course of this analysis, the trial judge had responded to submissions to the effect that there were aspects of Sanderson's statement, and other material, that suggested unreliability. His Honour examined this submission carefully and came to the conclusion that the ultimate version provided by Sanderson in his statement was reliable and was generally consistent with the observations of others. In that context, his Honour also made findings that were critical of the reliability of the evidence given by the brothers. He added: 

""Sebastian's evidence in relation to this event is unreliable. In his evidence in the Local Court he said he was attacked from behind, changing his evidence when he observed the CCTV. Christian has little memory of the events at all before being ejected from the station."" 

87After examining the statements of the individual transit officers, his Honour then addressed the important issue as to whether or not Schofield had been guilty of assaulting the brothers. In this part of the analysis, his Honour said: 

""The CCTV does not reveal any physical act of aggression by either plaintiff before Schofield lunged at Sebastian. There is no suggestion in any of the statements in exhibit H that either plaintiff punched or struck any of the transit officers."" 

The trial judge added: 

""I accept that Sebastian, in the course of his argument with Schofield, had frequent recourse to the word 'fucking' and it was during the course of this argument he insisted on his right to catch the train and refused to leave the station. He was supported in this approach by his brother Christian and although Christian may have been less verbally abusive, he was not going to leave the station and was equally determined to catch a train, albeit without a ticket."" 

88In relation to the circumstances leading to the removal and ultimate arrest, his Honour made the following findings of fact: 

""Borchard and Sinha then grabbed Sebastian by each taking an arm and escorting him out of the station. Sinha said that Sebastian put up some resistance as they walked out and on a couple of occasions they had to drag him (exhibit H tab 19). Borchard said he and Sinha, 'walked him down the ramp leading left from the western exit and onto the footpath' (exhibit H, tab 21). 

Once out on Showground Road the CCTV footage demonstrates Sebastian being dragged onto the public pathway and then pushed in the direction of the roadway. The statements in exhibit H suggest this was done by Sinha and shortly thereafter by Borchard, and I so find. Sebastian is seen attempting to return to the station. This is confirmed by the video (exhibit A). Borchard described this incident in the following terms: 

'POI2 immediately turned towards us and stepped very close to me. He was still behaving aggressively, swearing and making threats. I pushed him away from myself with both hands, making contact with his shoulders. POI2 fell backwards onto the ground. I said, 'Okay, you're under arrest for refusing to comply with the direction to leave the railway land' (exhibit H, attachment 14). 

Sinha described this episode as follows: 

'The male turned around and walked back towards us in an aggressive manner, moving quickly towards us. John pushed him back again and he stumbled. At some point John warned him that he would be arrested if he returned. As the male tried to come back at us he stumbled again. John and I arrested him. John applied the handcuffs while the male was on the ground and struggling, in my view, to assault us. The male got up several times and we tried to contain him again by putting him on the ground and crossing his legs. He kept getting up and Chris (a reference to Sanderson) came to assist us. To finally contain him Chris put his body weight on his front torso and John and I pinned down a leg each. He then remained fairly contained until the police arrived.' 

On the concourse outside the station, Blight restrained Christian by sitting on him until the police arrived. 

Senior Constable Leanne Wolseley was the first police officer on the scene, arriving shortly after the plaintiffs were restrained. She said both males were yelling and screaming. 

She walked over to one of the males and said, 'I am a police officer, I need you to calm down.' The male said, 'Get fucked, I'm not calming down.' She walked over to the other male who was struggling with the transit officers. She said, 'If you don't stop struggling I'll have to spray you.' This male said, 'Just get these fucking cuffs off me.' She said both males appeared to be becoming more aggressive with the transit officers. 

Blight handcuffed Christian. He was unaware precisely where he did this, but thought it was on the concourse. He said he was arrested because of his aggression and numerous offences, including smoking, drinking, swearing and not having a ticket. I interpolate that Christian was not smoking but Sebastian was. 

He said that five or six minutes after he arrested him he complained that the handcuffs were too tight, as a result of which he adjusted them. He said: 

'At one stage person of interest 2 managed to bring his handcuffed hands around the front of his body. Later to contain him I put my body weight across his body.' 

I infer from that, that Blight was sitting upon Christian to restrain him."" 

89There is no dispute that the police were called and subsequently attended at Gosford station, at which time the brothers were being restrained in the manner referred to by the trial judge. No complaint is made about the conduct of the police officers, either at the time they arrived or thereafter. In particular, there is no complaint about the manner in which the brothers were treated at Gosford police station. The brothers were placed in a police vehicle and taken to the Gosford police station, as I have earlier indicated. 

90It appears that Borchard told one of the police officers, Constable Baker: 

""I saw two males drinking and smoking on the platform and that they did not have a rail pass."" 

91Michael Riley (the security guard) and Schofield both attended Gosford police station and sought to identify which of the brothers had allegedly committed the offences. While there, Schofield corrected the information the police had been given. He indicated that it was only Sebastian who had been smoking on railway land. Five penalty notices were issued to Sebastian. These were for the following offences: 

1) Not comply with direction to leave station; 
2) Drinking liquor on railway land; 
3) Smoking on covered railway land; 
4) Use offensive language on railway property; and 
5) Travel on train without valid ticket. 

The penalty notices against Christian were for the same offences, with the exception of the one relating to ""smoking"". Having recited these facts, his Honour then made a statement which was the subject of some criticism during the hearing of the appeal. His Honour said: 

""I note no further action was taken in relation to ""fines referred to in the penalty notices."" 

(The appellants were later to submit that court proceedings in relation to the penalty notices continued, with the appellants required to spend some time going to court on two or three occasions before the proceedings were ultimately dismissed). 

92The trial judge next gave detailed consideration to a number of issues, including whether the brothers had been guilty of breaches of any of the conduct regulations contained in the Rail Safety (General) Regulation 2003 (NSW) made pursuant to the Rail Safety Act 2002 (NSW). His Honour identified as potentially relevant cl 5 (travel on a train without ticket), cl 13 (use offensive language on railway land), cl 15 (smoke on railway land), cl 18 (causing or likely to cause a nuisance or annoyance to others on the station). In relation to the powers of transit officers, his Honour noted clauses 18 and 58 in the Regulations. Each of these, in slightly different contexts, provided a power to direct a person to leave the station or railway land. 

93The trial judge then recited a submission by Mr McCulloch SC (who appeared for the defendants at trial): 

""Mr McCulloch SC submitted that the plaintiffs having committed a number of offences in breach of the regulation, the defendants acted lawfully to remove the plaintiffs and restrain them, and was a complete answer to the claims of assault, battery and false imprisonment. 

Further, that no more than reasonable force was used to achieve this end. In relation to the claim of injurious falsehood, it was submitted that the plaintiffs needed to prove malicious publication with the result that actual damage was sustained... 

Mr McCulloch SC submitted that the offences in the penalty notices were justified, as the plaintiffs had committed those offences, and the fact that the penalty notices were later withdrawn was not relevant."" 

94His Honour next summarised broadly the liability issues in controversy as follows: 

""(1) Were there breaches of the Regulations? 

(2) If there was a breach of the Regulations, were the defendants authorised to remove the plaintiffs from the railway property? 

(3) Was any more than reasonable force used in the course of the removal of the plaintiffs from railway property, such as to amount to an assault? 

(4) Was the apprehension and detaining of the plaintiffs, and the role of the police, unlawful in the circumstances constituting false imprisonment? 

(5) Were the defendants, or any of them, guilty of assault? 

(6) Are the defendants, or any of them, guilty of injurious falsehood?"" 

95In relation to the first broad issue he had identified, the trial judge considered a number of submissions that were made by the parties on the issue as to whether the conduct of either of the plaintiffs constituted a breach of any of the Regulations. There is no need for me to summarise these arguments or the detailed reasoning of his Honour, except in relation to the issue of breach of cl 13 (use offensive language on railway land). This is so because, on any view of it, the directions given by Sanderson (the principal transit officer) to the brothers related, as his Honour found, to their use of offensive language. 

96It is necessary to note, however, that his Honour found that both Sebastian and Christian were ""attempting"" to travel on a train without a ticket and were in breach of cl 5. Similarly, he found that Sebastian had earlier breached the regulation that prohibited smoking on railway land, although he had complied with the direction to finish his cigarette outside. He was also satisfied that there had been a breach of cl 15 in that both had been earlier drinking on railway property. In addition, his Honour thought that, having regard to their state of intoxication and their demonstrated belligerence, they were likely to cause a nuisance or annoyance to other persons on the station or, if permitted to catch a train, on the train. 

97Although a breach of cl 17 did not form the basis of the ultimate direction to leave the station, the trial judge's reasoning in that regard is relevant to the use of offensive language in the overall context of the directions ultimately given by Sanderson. His Honour said: 

""The evidence revealed that before arriving at the station the plaintiffs had consumed about 7 schooners of beer while watching the football that afternoon, following which they drank between 15 and 20 pre-mixed alcoholic drinks at a nightclub and continued to drink whilst on their way to the station. I would infer that they were heavily intoxicated, were belligerent and abusive. 

Offensive language was used and they had breached the Regulations earlier referred to. Notwithstanding these observations, Sanderson at one point, indicated that Christian was able to travel on the train provided he purchased a ticket, but declined to permit Sebastian to do so. 

Christian was not prepared to leave without his brother. Transit officer Borchard recorded in his notebook that Christian replied, 'He's not going anywhere, he's my fucking brother, we're catching the fucking train.' 

They were both adamant that the only way they were leaving was on a train."" 

In those circumstances, the trial judge found, in addition to the other breaches, that there was a breach of cl 17. 

98In relation to the issue of the use of offensive language (breach of cl 13) Mr Thompson, who appeared for the plaintiffs at trial, had submitted that there was no breach of the relevant clause ""as the language used had to be offensive to the person hearing it."" Mr Thompson submitted, in addition, that the trial judge could not be satisfied that ""Christian had said anything capable of offending anyone"". The trial judge's comments about these arguments were as follows: 

""I am of the opinion that the test is objective rather than subjective. Regardless of whether the transit officers were offended, I am of the view that the frequent and repeated use of the word 'fucking' in an abusive and belligerent manner amounts to offensive language and could also be described, perhaps, as offensive behaviour. It was put to Christian that he said, 'Get fucked, I'm going to Wyong'. He said he was not able to remember what he said to the transit officers but agrees he has used such language in the past. 

Schofield, when he reported the behaviour to the police, claimed that both plaintiffs were swearing. 

Transit officer Sidhu said that 'both males became abusive and aggressive in their language'. 

Transit officer Borchard recorded in his notebook that Christian said, 'He's not going anywhere, he's my fucking brother. We're catching the fucking train'. 

I am satisfied that both plaintiffs used offensive language, were belligerent and aggressive and determined not to leave the station without catching a train."" 

99The trial judge then proceeded to deal with the validity of the directions that he believed had been given to both brothers to leave the station. I shall set out these remarks in full: 

""The ultimate confrontation which led to their removal was the determination to board a train without a ticket and the refusal to comply with a direction to leave the station. Such direction is against the background of the plaintiffs' state of intoxication and their belligerent and abusive behaviour. Ultimately, Transit Officer Sanderson, following an exchange where the expletives were used, gave the plaintiffs a direction to leave the station 'as a result of offensive language'. 

When Sebastian replied, 'You can't fucking make me', a further direction was given by Sanderson to leave the station, informing the plaintiffs that it was an offence not to comply with that direction and that if they did not leave the station they would be taken out. 

Mr Thompson submitted that pursuant to cl 39(1) that the right of an authorised officer to direct a person to leave railway land is limited to where a person is 'committing an offence'. 

Having regard to my earlier finding that the language used was offensive, as the language used was relatively contemporaneous with the direction that was given, I am satisfied it was given at the time the offence was committed. 

Further, although not referred to in terms by Sanderson in his direction, their continuing intention to board a train without a ticket was a continuing attempt to breach cl 5 as was their continuing state of intoxication likely to cause a nuisance or annoyance to other persons on the station or train. Having regard to these matters, the plaintiffs could be under no illusion as to why they were being asked to leave. 

Mr Thompson submitted that for a person to be lawfully removed by an authorised officer pursuant to cl 58 he must fail 'to comply with a direction given under this regulation to leave', and that a simple direction to leave was not sufficient because it must specify the reason of the direction being a reason grounded in the regulation. 

I am of the view that a valid direction was given and the consequences of failure to comply were also given. The determination to board a train without paying for a ticket and their level of intoxication in circumstances where they were likely to be a nuisance or annoyance to others would also have been a valid reason for a direction to leave the station to be given. If follows, on the balance of probabilities, that there were breaches of the Regulations as referred to above and that in the circumstances the defendants were authorised to remove the plaintiff from the railway property."" 

100The trial judge next gave consideration as to whether the plaintiffs had been assaulted by the transit officers or by any of them. His findings were quite clear in this regard. He was satisfied that Schofield assaulted both Sebastian and Christian. Moreover, he was satisfied that no physical violence had been offered by either plaintiff before Schofield lunged at Sebastian, connecting with his throat and neck, forcing him backwards towards the railing, in the course of which Sebastian's shirt was ripped. Apart from the ripping of the shirt, his Honour found that there were no physical injuries sustained by Sebastian as a consequence of the assault. 

101His Honour held, however, that the attack upon Christian was of a more serious nature. He, at some point, had been forced to the ground by Schofield. While Christian may have had hold of Schofield's leg on the ground, this constituted no more than an inconvenience to Schofield. The officer grabbed Christian's head and slammed it into the ground. In addition, he slapped Christian's face two or three times with the back of his hand, causing Christian's lip to bleed. His Honour continued: 

""As stated earlier in these reasons, I am of the view that the defendants were entitled to remove the plaintiffs from the railway property. I am of the view, however, that the second defendant, Transit Officer Schofield, assaulted both plaintiffs in the course of the removal process. There was no necessity for such a violent reaction. The plaintiffs were clearly outnumbered and it seems to me they could have been physically escorted and restrained without the necessity for the violence exhibited by the second defendant. 

I am not satisfied that any of the other transit officers were complicit or involved in these assaults, and came as a surprise to them. Indeed, Transit Officer Singh told the second defendant when he was striking Christian, 'Don't do that' (para 27, Statement of Rivinda Singh, exhibit H, tab 17). 

The plaintiffs were then removed from the immediate vicinity of the railway property. Christian was carried and Sebastian escorted by a transit officer on either side. This was partially depicted on CCTV (exhibit A). 

Consistent with their determination not to leave railway property, they struggled and were resistant at being removed. I do not regard the physical actions of the transit officers removing the plaintiffs as warranting criticism in the circumstances. 

There is no suggestion that any physical injury occurred while they were being taken from the station and I find there was no more than reasonable force used in their removal. In evaluating this issue I have taken into the consideration the fact that both plaintiffs were physically resistant to being removed and continued to be abusive and aggressive."" 

102His Honour then turned to the next broad issue to be determined. This was whether the apprehension and the restraint of the brothers by the transit officers, prior to the arrival of the police, had been unlawful, thereby constituting false imprisonment. In this regard, his Honour accepted, on the balance of probabilities, the contemporaneous notes completed by Transit Officer Borchard. He noted, in that regard, that the plaintiffs had little memory of the events outside the station, and were not in a position to challenge the description of the events in Borchard's statement. As to the position of Sebastian, his Honour made the following findings: 

""Sebastian was escorted from the station by Transit Officer Borchard and Sinha. When they arrived at the exit, he was released and they pushed him out, at the same time Borchard saying, 'Now leave, don't come back'. 

Contrary to those directions, Sebastian immediately turned around, stepping very close to Borchard, was aggressive and swearing and making threats. Borchard again pushed him away with both hands making contact with his shoulders, following which Sebastian fell to the ground. Borchard then said to Sebastian, 'OK, you're under arrest for refusing to comply with a direction to leave railway land'. He was subsequently handcuffed by Borchard who described him as 'kicking out with his legs, thrashing about on the ground' and in order to control him for his safety and their own Sinha stood on one leg and Borchard stood on the other. Sanderson assisted by holding down his torso."" 

His Honour noted that a more detailed description was contained in the statement of Sinha. These notes stated: 

""The male turned around and walked back towards us in an aggressive manner, moving quickly towards us. John pushed him back again and he stumbled. At some point John warned him that he would be arrested if he returned. As the male tried to come back at us he stumbled again. John and I arrested him. John applied the handcuffs while he was on the ground and struggling in my view to assault us. The male got up several times. We tried to contain him again by putting him on the ground and crossing his legs. He kept getting up and Chris (Sanderson) came to assist us. To finally contain him, Chris put his body weight on his front torso and John and I pinned down a leg each. He then remained fairly contained until the police arrived."" 

103So far as Christian was concerned, Transit Officer Jimenez provided the following description of his arrest and restraint (as quoted by the trial judge): 

""We carried POI2 (Christian) out and down Showground Road ramp to the front of the station. I can't recall exactly when we cuffed him, but I think it was upstairs on the concourse. He was arrested, and cuffed because of his aggression and his numerous offences including smoking, drinking, swearing and not having a ticket. About 5 or 6 minutes after POI2 was cuffed, he complained that they were too tight. I adjusted the cuffs so they were more comfortable. At one stage POI2 managed to bring his handcuffed hands across the front of his body. Later to contain him I put my weight across his body. When the police arrived POI2 said something like, 'Get this fat fucking cunt off me'. A female officer told him that I would not get off him until backup came and said something to him like, 'I know how aggressive you are'."" 

104Sidhu said that Christian was carried down the ramp and onto the pavement near the side of the ramp wall on the street side. He said he was placed face-down and handcuffed with his hands behind his back. He said he came up on his knees and managed to move his hands in front of his body and said something like, ""I'll turn psycho"". The note continued: 

""The position was dangerous for all us, with his arms free to swing with his handcuffs, following which he was placed on the ground and kept in that position until the police arrived."" 

105The trial judge found that during the course of their restraint both plaintiffs continued to be abusive. Indeed, when the police arrived they continued to be aggressive and abusive and used offensive language. Such was the extent of their aggressive behaviour that Senior Constable Wolseley, when she arrived, threatened to use capsicum spray to subdue them. Another police officer, Constable Belinda Baker, said that when she arrived they were struggling on the ground, ""yelling and swearing and placed in the rear of the police truck due to their aggressive behaviour"". Senior Constable Lewis described the plaintiffs as ""intoxicated and aggressive"". The trial judge accepted that, upon their removal, the plaintiffs continued to be abusive and aggressive, and used offensive language. He added this comment: 

""Further, had they not been arrested and restrained they were intent on re-entering the railway property and in Sebastian's case he attempted to do so. Bearing in mind that Christian at all times was in support of his brother I infer that had he not been restrained, he would similarly have attempted to gain re-entry. 

Their behaviour was such that they were not prepared to leave the station voluntarily and in the absence of the restraint there was a possibility of physical confrontation with the transit officers which may well have exposed both the plaintiffs and the transit officers to physical injury. 

The manner of restraint was, in all the circumstances, reasonable, having regard to their aggressive behaviour."" 

106The trial judge was also satisfied that, had the plaintiffs moved away from the station after they had been removed from the concourse, the occasion for their restraint probably would not have occurred. He found that it was their ""subsequent behaviour"" which led to their arrest and restraint until the police arrived. He was satisfied of the likelihood that both plaintiffs would have re-entered the station leading to a further confrontation, had they not been restrained. 

107The submissions on this point at trial were within a brief compass. Mr Thompson submitted that the power to effect a ""citizen's arrest"" did not arise under s 352(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (as it then stood) because what was involved here, at most, was a breach of a regulation and not an offence under an Act. This interpretation did not find favour with the trial judge. He determined that breaches of the Regulations might properly be described as offences under the Rail Safety Act 2002 (NSW). His Honour's conclusions in relation to the false imprisonment claim were as follows: 

""Having regard to the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the claim based on false imprisonment has been established. 

The plaintiffs were arrested and detained because of their failure to comply with a direction to leave railway property, such direction being lawfully given and given further at a time when Sebastian attempted to gain re-entry. In the absence of restraint, and had re-entry been achieved, further breaches of the Regulation were likely to occur, particularly having regard to their intoxicated state and their aggressive and abusive behaviour. 

The police were called and arrived within 5 or 10 minutes, so the time of restraint was not unduly protracted. In evaluating the conduct of the transit officers the matter must be judged by reference to the pressure of events and the agony of the moment, not by reference to hindsight (see Macintosh v Webster (1980) 43 FLR 112). 

Having regard to the plaintiffs' aggressive and abusive behaviour and the fact that they were thrashing around while on the ground, the method used by the transit officers to restrain them, namely using handcuffs, placing them on the ground and sitting on them, was a reasonable application of force in those circumstances. 

I am also of the opinion that in the circumstances in which the transit officers were confronted that there was a valid exercise of the power of arrest permitted pursuant to s 352(1) of the Crimes Act ."" 

108The final liability claim considered by his Honour was that based on the tort of injurious falsehood. In this regard, the plaintiffs placed reliance upon statements made by Transit Officers Borchard and Schofield to the police. The police had been told that the two males had been ""drinking and smoking on the platform"". The falsehood relied upon was that neither plaintiff went down to the platform. At all times, they were in fact on the railway concourse above it. In addition, there was the fact that Christian had not been smoking at all. His Honour then referred to Palmer-Bruyn & Parker Pty Ltd v Parsons [2001] HCA 69; (2001) 208 CLR 388. In particular, his Honour referred to a passage which established that the plaintiff in a claim for injurious falsehood must establish falsity, malice and special damage. His Honour dismissed the claim on the basis that the plaintiffs had not established either malice or special damage. In discussing the issue, his Honour said: 

""The inaccuracies referred to by Mr Thompson in his submissions were, in my view, minor. It is true there was no evidence that Christian was smoking, such factor being corrected by Schofield when he spoke to the police. The plaintiffs had not in fact reached the platform, but at one point had passed through the barriers leading to the platform. There is no issue that the plaintiffs were drunk and refused to comply with a direction to leave, were swearing and did not have tickets for travel. I do not regard the presence of such minor inconsistencies as demonstrating malice on the part of the transit officers concerned... 

... having regard to the breaches to which I have referred, I am not satisfied that Borchard's error in stating that two males were smoking instead of one, and Schofield's statement that swearing and smoking was on a platform rather than other railway property were reported maliciously or established special damage."" 

It might again be noted that the penalty notices issued against Christian did not include one relating to an allegation of smoking on railway land. 

109His Honour then considered the issue of damages. There is no need for me to repeat the detail of the trial judge's examination of the medical material before him. It was a very comprehensive analysis. His conclusion regarding Sebastian was that he was not satisfied that Sebastian sustained an injury to his back or right knee. At most, he may have suffered some soft tissue bruising. In relation to Christian, the trial judge found that, apart from the injury to his lip caused by Schofield striking him, he was not satisfied that Christian had sustained any injury prior to his being arrested and detained. In relation to both brothers, his Honour said: 

""Any injuries which the plaintiffs sustained were in the course of them, being lawfully restrained and awaiting the arrival of police. Such injuries, as I have found, were at best insignificant and were the result of their own violent and irrational response while being arrested and restrained. I do not regard the force used as unreasonable in the circumstances."" 

110His Honour added that, if it were subsequently found contrary to his view, that injuries were sustained as a consequence of false imprisonment, or were the result of assault after the plaintiffs were ejected, he would have assessed such damages in each case at $5,000. 

111The trial judge then assessed damages in relation to Schofield's assault. He thought such damages were restricted to the act of Schofield lunging at Sebastian, coming into contact with his neck or throat, ripping his shirt and forcing him to the ground. His Honour described this as ""a frightening experience"". He assessed the damages in favour of Sebastian at $5,000. 

112On the issue of aggravated damages for Sebastian, his Honour said: 

""Aggravated damages are claimed. Such damages may be awarded where the defendant has acted in committing a tort with contumelious disregard for the plaintiff's rights in an insulting or high-handed way or with malice. 

Such conduct must have increased the plaintiff's suffering. I am of the opinion that the actions of the second defendant, were, in the circumstances, high-handed, which would have increased the plaintiff's suffering, warranting an award of aggravated damages. 

I take into consideration what could only be described as the provocative behaviour of the plaintiffs and their belligerence in assessing such award. I regard an assessment in the case of Sebastian of $5,000 as appropriate for aggravated damages, making a total of $10,000 in damages."" 

113In relation to the assault on Christian, his Honour stated that he regarded this as a ""more serious assault"" than that sustained by Sebastian. Christian had been ""struck two or three times in the region of the face and mouth, causing his lip to bleed. His head was also slammed into the ground."" 

114The excuse offered by Schofield that Christian was holding onto his leg did not warrant the reaction by him. In relation to Schofield's actions, his Honour commented: 

""His actions were inappropriate and regarded as such by a number of the transit officers. They were high-handed and no doubt added to the suffering of the plaintiff."" 

His Honour assessed damages in favour of Christian in the sum of $7,000 and aggravated damages in the sum of $5,000, making the total damages $12,000. 

115On the issue of exemplary damages, the trial judge said: 

""I do not regard either case as appropriate for the award of exemplary damages. I bear in mind that the power to award such damages should be exercised with restraint. In order to qualify for such an award the defendant's conduct must be of such a character that it merits punishment, so that it must have been knowingly wanton, fraudulent, malicious, violent, cruel, insolent, high-handed or an abuse of power. 

Also of relevance in this case, as far as exemplary damages are concerned, is the abuse and belligerent behaviour of the plaintiffs. I also take into consideration the fact that the second defendant was prosecuted for assault on both plaintiffs and found guilty of those offences in the local court. The second defendant appealed to the District Court and the conviction in respect of Christian was quashed. The finding of guilt in respect of Sebastian was confirmed, but his conviction was quashed pursuant to the provisions of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Nevertheless, such matters remain on the criminal record of the second defendant and in that sense could be regarded as a punishment as a result of the events of that evening. He was also subject to disciplinary proceedings and suspended from his employment."" 

116Finally, in relation to the claims against the transit officers (other than Schofield) his Honour said: 

""I do not regard the actions of the third to the seventh defendants as constituting guilt of any of the torts alleged or for any of the damages sustained by the plaintiffs. 

The actions of the second defendant were without warning to them and their subsequent behaviour and the removal of the plaintiffs and the subsequent restraint in my view was lawful."" 

117Since State Rail had agreed that it would be vicariously liable for any verdict against Schofield, his Honour made orders and entered verdicts in favour of the two brothers in the sums mentioned at the outset of these reasons. 

Resolution of the issues 

118I turn now to examine and respond to the grounds of appeal. Both the grounds of appeal and submissions for the appellants have been amended a number of times. At the hearing of the appeal, however, a number of the grounds were either amended or abandoned, so the matters in contest have been, to some degree, reduced. There remain, however, well over thirty grounds in each appeal. Rather than deal with each ground of appeal individually, I will adopt the course sensibly used by the trial judge. This was to identify broad topics in dispute for the purposes of analysis. I will, however, indicate the relevant grounds by reference to their corresponding numbers in the final Amended Notice of Appeal in each case. 

1. Was a valid direction to leave given to both brothers? 

[Sebastian - Grounds 1 to 9, Third Amended Notice of Appeal; 
Christian - Grounds 1 to 10, Third Amended Notice of Appeal]. 

119Before addressing the circumstances involved in these grounds, it is necessary to note that in the final Notice of Appeal, each appellant had particularised a number of factual findings made by the trial judge that were the subject of challenge in the appeal. There were three challenges made by Sebastian and over twenty challenges made by Christian. A number related to the issues now to be discussed. The challenges, however, were substantially modified or abandoned at the hearing of the appeal. Those that remain will be examined in their particular context. 

120Sebastian had been drinking intoxicating liquor on railway land on the morning in question. That matter was not disputed. He had also been smoking on railway land. Again, that matter was not disputed. Mr Neil did not argue that those two matters were not offences under the relevant conduct regulations. Senior counsel argued, however, that the conduct of Sebastian, in drinking and smoking on the concourse, did not, in the circumstances, entitle the transit officers to direct him to leave, and that, consequently, he was not bound to do so. Mr Neil argued that, if this was so, it would have a substantial bearing on the next issue to be discussed, namely the removal of Sebastian from the concourse. 

121Christian had also been drinking on the concourse but he, like his brother, had complied with the direction to leave the concourse while drinking. Both brothers may have intended to travel without a ticket, but they had not, senior counsel argued, attempted to do so. 

122Mr Neil further argued that there had been no justification for a direction under cl 18 based on the provisions of cl 17. Overall, his submission was that there was no ground available whereby a direction to leave could have validly been given to Sebastian. 

123These arguments suggest that it is necessary to examine whether there was in fact a breach of any of cl 5 and 57, 13, 15, or 17, and whether the power to give a direction to leave under either cl 18 or 39 had been enlivened. The arguments also suggest that it is necessary to determine whether the trial judge erred in relation to any of his findings in these regards. 

124For reasons I shall in due course state, the necessary inquiry is really confined to the question of whether, in Sebastian's case (or, for that matter, in Christian's case), a direction under cl 59 was enlivened by a breach of cl 3 of the regulations (""use offensive language... on any railway land""). 

125Before stating those reasons, however, it will be convenient to refer to the legislation and regulations referable to the events which occurred at Gosford Railway Station on the morning in question. 

126The relevant statute in force at the time was the Rail Safety Act . The object of the Act is ""to promote the safe construction, operation and maintenance of railways"" (s 3). Railway offences are dealt with in s 95, as follows: 

"" 95 Railway offences 

The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the following: 

(a) the regulation or prohibition of persons travelling or attempting to travel on a train without paying a fare or without paying the correct fare, 

(b) the regulation or prohibition of persons who travel or attempt to travel on a train for which they do not have the correct, or a valid, ticket or pass, 

(c) the regulation or prohibition of persons who fail to pay a fare on demand, 

(d) the regulation or prohibition of eating, drinking or smoking in trains or in other public areas of a railway, 

(e) the conduct of passengers and drivers on trains or in other parts of a railway, 

(f) the powers and duties of drivers of trains and of authorised officers, 

(g) the authority of drivers of trains, and of authorised officers, to eject persons guilty of any contravention of a regulation."" 

(There are other matters not relevant to the present proceedings). 

127An ""authorised officer"" is defined in s 4(1) of the Rail Safety Act . There was no dispute, ultimately, in the present proceedings that the transit officers were authorised officers. 

128Commencement of proceedings for an offence under the Rail Safety Act is dealt with in s 103, as follows: 

"" 103 Proceedings for offences 

(1) Proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations are to be disposed of in a summary manner before: 

(a) a Local Court, or 
(b) the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction. 

(2) The maximum pecuniary penalty that may be imposed by a Local Court in proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations is 500 penalty units. 

(3) Proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations may be taken within 2 years after the offence was committed despite anything in any other Act. 

(4) In any proceedings for an offence under this Act, the onus of proving that a person had a reasonable excuse is on the defendant."" 

129Section 105 enables an authorised officer to serve a penalty notice on a person who appears to the officer to have committed a penalty notice offence. 

130There is a further regulation-making section under the Miscellaneous division of the Act. Section 117 enables the Governor to make regulations, ""not inconsistent with this Act, for or with respect to any matter that by this Act is required or permitted to be prescribed or that is necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to the Act"". The topics included extend to ""the regulation of the conduct of passengers and other persons on railways, and the exclusion of persons from railways"". 

131I turn now to the Rail Safety (General) Regulation 2003. The Regulation was made by his Excellency the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council under the Rail Safety Act . The object of the Regulation is stated to be ""to make provision for a number of matters"", including the following (see Rail Safety (General) Regulation 2003, Explanatory Note, Gazette No 39, 7 February 2003, 800): 

""(b) offences relating to the misuse of tickets, failure to obtain a ticket, failure to present a ticket for inspection and failure to offer a ticket for collection or processing, 

(c) offences related to travelling on a train without paying a fare, 

(d) offences prohibiting certain conduct on a train or railway land."" 

132Clause 3 contains a definition of ""railway land"", as follows: 

""railway land means: 

(a) land vested in, or under the control of, an accredited person for a railway and used in connection with the railway... 

(b) land over which a light rail system operates (whether by way of easements or otherwise) 

restricted area of a station means: 

(a) if the station has no ticket barrier-the platform, and 

(b) if the station has a ticket barrier-the platform and all other parts of the station between the platform and the ticket barrier."" 

133Clause 5 relevantly provides: 

"" 5 Fare to be paid and ticket to be held 

(1) A person must not, without reasonable excuse, travel on a train unless: 

(a) the fare for the person's travel has been paid, and 

(b) the person (or someone accompanying the person) holds a valid ticket for the person's travel. 

Maximum penalty: 5 penalty units."" 

134A defence is provided if a person is able to prove that there were no facilities available at the station at which the person boarded the train to enable that person to pay the fare or obtain a ticket before boarding the train. (There are other defences not relevant to the present proceedings). 

135Clause 13 is in the following terms: 

"" 13 Conduct generally 

(1) A person must not on any train, on any railway land or on any part of monorail works wilfully: 

(a) use offensive language, or 

(b) behave offensively, or 

Maximum penalty: 5 penalty units."" 

136Clause 15 is as follows: 

"" 15 Smoking generally prohibited 

(1) A person must not smoke on any train or on any part of railway land or any part of monorail works that is roofed or otherwise covered. 

Maximum penalty: 5 penalty units."" 

137Clauses 17 and 18 are as follows: 

"" 17 Drinking of alcohol generally prohibited 

(1) A person must not drink any intoxicating liquor on any train, any railway land or any part of monorail works. 

Maximum penalty: 5 penalty units. 

... 

(3) In this clause, drink includes be in possession of an opened container of intoxicating liquor. 

18 Passengers who are intoxicated 

(1) If, in the opinion of an authorised officer, a person on a station or a train, or at a light rail stop: 

(a) is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or another drug, and 

(b) is causing, or is likely to cause, a nuisance or annoyance to other persons on the station or train... 

the authorised officer may direct the person to leave the station, train... 

(2) A person must comply with a direction given under subclause (1). 

Maximum penalty: 5 penalty units."" 

138Clause 39 is as follows: 

"" 39 Direction to leave train or premises 

(1) If, in the opinion of an authorised officer, a person is committing an offence under this Part, the authorised officer may direct the person to leave the train, railway land ... concerned. 

(2) A person must comply with a direction given under subclause (1). 

Maximum penalty: 5 penalty units."" 

139Clause 57 provides that a person who attempts to do anything that is prohibited by a provision of the Regulation is taken to have committed an offence under that provision, punishable accordingly. Clause 58 then provides: 

"" 58 Removal of persons 

A person who refuses or fails to comply with a direction given under this Regulation to leave any train or railway land or part of monorail works may be removed from the train or land or part of the monorail works by an authorised officer."" 

Sebastian 

140Although not referred to by the trial judge, it seems from the transit officers' statements, tendered by the plaintiffs, that a third direction was given to leave. This direction had been given by Schofield. The sequence of events appeared to be that, about ten or fifteen minutes before Sanderson gave his directions to leave, Schofield, together with Transit Officers Blight, and Jimenez, had been speaking to the brothers about drinking and smoking on railway property. Although the various statements do not match up precisely in detail, the sequence appears to be that a female officer (Ms Truscott) came into the meal room and said that there were two males drinking on the concourse area and ""giving the security guard on duty a hard time"". This was a reference to the earlier requests made by Transit Officers Sidhu and Singh and, separately, by Security Officer Riley. It is reasonably clear that the person ""looking for a blue"" (as described by Ms Truscott) was Sebastian, not Christian. I do not consider that the trial judge's findings suggested otherwise. 

141It was at that point that Schofield and the other officers I have mentioned moved from the staff room and spoke to both brothers, informing them that they could not drink on railway land. It seems that this discussion was relatively amicable, with the brothers agreeing to finish their drinks outside without much protest. It was when they came back onto the concourse area that the officers noticed that Sebastian was smoking. Schofield told him to put his cigarette out, or to finish it outside (depending on which version is correct) and, once again, that direction appeared to have been complied with, without any overt hostility or aggression. 

142Schofield, Sinha and Jimenez then left the concourse by way of the western exit, out into the street. It was some little time later that observations were made by other transit officers of the two brothers walking through the barriers onto the restricted area above the railway platform. They were directed back out onto the concourse area where the discussions with Sanderson, Borchard and others took place. These conversations continued for about six minutes. 

143It seems that, shortly prior to the final direction being given by Sanderson, Schofield had come over to join the group, as had other transit officers. According to Transit Officer Blight, after a little time, Schofield joined in the discussion. He said something like: 

""What's going on here, I told you boys to behave yourself. You're going to have to leave the station."" 

(This was the third direction to leave the station). 

144Transit Officer Jimenez said that ""Schofield spoke to the men and told them to leave the station"". He heard Sebastian say something like, ""I'll kill you, you fucking cunts. I'm not leaving the station"". It was at that time, or shortly thereafter, that Schofield lunged at Sebastian. Transit Officer Sinha also heard Schofield give ""the males a directive to leave the station"", but they ""continued to swear at the TOs present"". According to his statement, it was at that point that Schofield said, ""I've already told you guys to behave"". 

145It is reasonable to conclude, accordingly, that Sanderson gave a direction to leave based on the use of offensive language. It is also reasonable to conclude that he gave a second direction. These were the findings made by the trial judge. It is also clear, however, that Schofield himself gave a similar direction, following upon the two directions given by Sanderson. Given the overall context, there is no reason to doubt that Schofield's direction was given on the same basis, although there is no precise record of the actual words he used (Schofield did not give a statement to the railway inquiry into the incident, and was not called by either side as a witness at trial). In my opinion, the trial judge was correct to conclude that Sebastian had committed a number of offences under cl 13 (offensive language) and that Sanderson was entitled, pursuant to cl 39, to direct him to leave the concourse area. The practical consequence of compliance with that direction is that Sebastian would not have been entitled to go down onto the platform and attempt to board a train. Of course, as the trial judge noted, Sebastian had no ticket and no intention of obtaining a ticket, but the direction, as I perceive it, was not given on that basis. It undoubtedly provided the context in which the escalation of the offensive language took place, but it was not the ultimate basis for the direction. 

146The grounds of appeal also raised questions about whether Sebastian's language could properly be described as ""offensive"". It was further argued that Sebastian was not using offensive language precisely at the time the direction was given. In that regard, it was argued that cl 39 speaks in the present tense (""if... a person is committing an offence under this Part""). As to the first argument, there was a plethora of evidence that Sebastian was repeatedly using the word ""fuck"" or ""fucking"" in a loud belligerent and abusive manner throughout his presence on railway property. As the CCTV footage shows, there were members of the public moving through the concourse area, notwithstanding that it was very early in the morning. The use of the type of language employed by Sebastian and, in particular, its belligerent and aggressive tone, plainly allowed for a conclusion that, in the circumstances, repeated breaches of cl 13 had occurred. The behaviour was capable in law of establishing a prima facie case against Sebastian and, if it occurred as described, could or would have established beyond reasonable doubt that he was guilty of the relevant offences ( Burns v Seagrave & Anor [2000] NSWSC 77 per Simpson J). As to the further argument, the language was continuous, up to and beyond the giving of the three directions to which I have made reference. There is no substance in either of these two arguments. 

Christian 

147It is clear that Christian was not as belligerent as his brother. However, there was ample evidence before the trial judge to satisfy him that Christian had been, and was, using the same type of offensive language as his brother, although not perhaps to the same extent. Originally there were challenges to the trial judge's findings in this respect. On the appeal hearing, however, Mr Neil essentially withdrew the challenges to the findings that Christian had used offensive language. As I have said, there was ample evidence that Christian had been in breach of cl 3. There was also evidence that, at the time of giving the directions, both Christian and his brother were ""swearing"" at the transit officers, and swearing generally. This appears plainly from the detail of the statements of Transit Officers Blight, Sinha, Jimenez, Singh and Sidhu. 

148The arguments on behalf of Christian essentially raised two matters relevant to the issues presently under discussion. The first was that the trial judge may have ""misrepresented"" Christian by attributing to him a remark that was, in fact, made by his brother shortly before Schofield assaulted Sebastian. Secondly, it was argued that the direction to leave was not actually given to Christian, but to his elder brother. If that were so, senior counsel argued, there would have been no valid basis on which Christian was removed or later arrested. 

149I have earlier set out in full the passage where the trial judge described the conversation that took place between the brothers and the transit officers near the barrier and the ticket vending machines. I have, for my part, carefully examined the various statements from which his Honour took the conversations. It appears, in the main, that the trial judge has correctly relied on a number of the transit officers' statements, in order to set out the dialogue in which he attributes remarks to both Sebastian and Christian. In particular, the dialogue shows, as has been mentioned, that at one point, Sanderson indicated to Christian that he would be prepared to let him buy a ticket and catch the train. It will be recalled that Sanderson had said: 

""Mate you can go and by [sic] a ticket and catch a train if you want but he's not going down there."" 

150To this, Christian had replied: 

""I'm not going anywhere, he's my brother."" 

151This brief dialogue is, in fact, taken from Sanderson's statement. Transit Officer Borchard put the relevant exchange in slightly different terms: 

""POI2 said, 'Not if I've got a fucking 50 dollar note. Anyway, I'm getting on the fucking train. Whose going to fucking stop me, you?'"" 

152Sanderson said: 

""OK that's it, you're not getting on the train. I'm giving you a direction to leave the station."" 

153Transit Officer Sanderson turned to POI1 and said: 

""You're OK mate. Go buy a ticket and you can get on the train."" 

154Borchard said to POI1: 

""Come on mate, you don't want to be involved in this guy's troubles, why don't you go buy your ticket and get on the train."" 

155POI2 said: 

""He's not going anywhere, he's my fucking brother. We're catching the fucking train."" 

156It was then that Transit Officer Sanderson said: 

""I'm giving you a direction to leave. Leave the station now."" 

157The point needs to be made that, throughout all the statements, Sebastian had been referred to as ""POI1"" and Christian had been referred to as ""POI2"". As appears from the above dialogue, however, Transit Officer Borchard referred to Sebastian as ""POI2"". 

158It was probably for this reason that the trial judge, when he came to consider the broad issues argued before him, attributed the remark, ""He's not going anywhere, he's my fucking brother, we're catching the fucking train"", to Christian. In fact, it appears this was said by Sebastian and not by his younger brother. However, I do not think that anything of major importance turns on this error. Sanderson, in his statement, correctly attributed to Christian (after he had been offered the opportunity of travelling on the train by himself) the words: 

""I'm not going anywhere. He's my brother."" 

159As I have said, in the main part of the trial judge's decision, where he outlined the sequence of facts and dialogue, he attributed these words correctly to Christian. 

160What follows from all this? In my opinion, the trial judge, notwithstanding the wrongful attribution of the remark, was justified in concluding that Christian had used offensive language and was in breach of cl 13 of the Rail Safety (General) Regulation. There was ample evidence to support that conclusion, when regard is had to the detail contained in the other officers' statements. Secondly, although the transit officers were initially prepared to allow Christian to travel on the train if he bought a ticket, the position crystallised when Christian aligned himself with his brother by indicating, in effect, that he too insisted that his brother be allowed to travel with him on the train, and that they were both prepared to travel without tickets. The combined outcome of the remarks made by both brothers showed that they stood shoulder-to-shoulder on this issue. Moreover, after this statement, it was clear that Christian had used further offensive language and indulged in swearing, although perhaps not to the extent that Sebastian had. 

161While it is true that the first direction appears to have been given only to Sebastian, it is clear, in my view, that the second direction given by Sanderson, and the third direction given by Schofield, were clearly directed to both brothers. By this time, it had been made abundantly clear that the brothers were committed to an enterprise to travel back to Wyong without train tickets. More importantly, their aggressive insistence on this was accompanied by offensive swearing used indiscriminately by each of them. 

162It is clear that when Schofield made his lunge at Sebastian that, at that point, both brothers had refused to comply with the directions they had been given, and were refusing to leave the concourse area. Both brothers, as I have said, remained resolute in their intention to travel to Wyong by train without purchasing tickets for the journey. The trial judge was correct to find that a valid direction had been given to both brothers on the basis of their use of offensive language. It was clearly seen as such by the transit officers who witnessed the giving of the directions and gave statements to the railway enquiry. The trial judge was also entitled to find that the consequences of failure to comply were also stated. Although his Honour went on to consider whether there were other bases which would or might have enlivened the giving of a direction (for example, attempting to travel on a train without a ticket, etc), it was strictly unnecessary for him to do so. Equally, it is unnecessary for this court to examine those questions in light of the fact that the direction was validly given to each brother on the basis of breaches of cl 13. 

2. Did the transit officers (apart from Schofield) assault the appellants? 

[Sebastian - Grounds 10, 11 and 12; Christian - Grounds 12, 13 and 14] 

163The starting point for the submissions on this issue is the trial judge's finding that the defendants were entitled to remove the brothers from railway property. As I have said, there were three directions to leave given, and the last two may properly be regarded as having been given to both brothers. It is clear that, despite the directions that had been given, neither Sebastian nor Christian was going to leave of his own volition. Their truculent behaviour, obduracy and offensive language were continuing features of their determination to remain at the station and travel by train without tickets. It was clearly open to the trial judge to make the finding he did. 

164The second finding of importance was that Schofield assaulted the appellants. As his Honour found, there was no need for such a violent reaction. The brothers were clearly outnumbered, and they could have been physically escorted and restrained without the necessity for the type of assault launched by Schofield. His Honour thought, however, that an examination of the CCTV footage demonstrated that, leaving aside the assault by Schofield, the brothers were physically escorted and restrained in a reasonable fashion. His Honour was also satisfied that there was evidence to show that the transit officers, other than Schofield, did not participate in an assault on the brothers. Indeed there was evidence that there was dissent from Schofield's actions. The removal was effected quite rapidly. Christian was carried by a group of officers, and Sebastian escorted by a transit officer on either side of him. The evidence plainly showed that they remained determined not to leave railway property; they struggled and were resistant to being removed. Indeed, after removal, Sebastian charged back in to the area leading to the concourse and endeavoured to re-enter. 

165Christian's lip injury was, of course, caused by Schofield's assault upon him. Schofield also banged Christian's head into the ground, but it does not seem that any lasting injuries or ill effects were occasioned by this, according to the trial judge's findings. Transit Officer Jimenez said that Christian resisted being removed. He carried him, holding his right arm, while another transit officer carried his left arm, and two others carried his feet. Christian was described as ""continuing to be resistive and aggressive"". 

166The trial judge held that, when Transit Officers Borchard and Sinha took Sebastian to the exit, he was told, ""Now leave, don't come back"". Contrary to those directions, according to the findings, Sebastian turned around, stepped very close to Borchard, became aggressive, swore and made threats. There was some pushing and Borchard said to Sebastian, ""OK, you're under arrest for refusing to comply with a direction to leave railway land"". Sebastian was described as ""kicking out with his legs, thrashing about on the ground and requiring restraint"". 

167In examining the question as to whether the transit officers (other than Schofield) assaulted either of the plaintiffs, the trial judge, it seems, had carefully examined the CCTV footage. This was also examined for the purpose of assessing the issue as to whether Schofield had assaulted the plaintiffs. This court was given the same opportunity on appeal as had been given to the trial judge. 

168In my opinion, after a careful examination of the moving images, nothing can be seen in the footage that casts any doubt on the validity of his Honour's findings. I am satisfied, for this reason, that the factual findings to which I have made reference were clearly open to the trial judge. Mr Neil's submission, that the transit officers were assisting Schofield in connection with his illegal assaults upon the brothers, cannot be accepted. 

169At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, Mr Hooke gave the court a bundle of coloured still photographs, which were assumed to be the equivalent of the black and white stills exhibited before the trial judge. The copies in the Blue Appeal Book were discoloured by the reproduction process, and they were virtually unexaminable. 

170There was some controversy between the parties as to the use the court might make of the colour stills. The original stills had been contained in exhibit H before the trial judge. The colour images provided to us were not before the primary judge, but were generally thought to be the same images as the black and white stills that had been provided to the court below. Mr Hooke asked that the colour stills be treated with caution. He submitted that they did not appear to be in a strict chronological sequence, and that they therefore could not be regarded as having been assembled in any particular order. 

171Mr Neil (while acknowledging that there was some disparity between the original exhibits and the colour stills) suggested that they might be regarded as the same scenes as appeared in the black and white still photographs in the Appeal Book (less photos 18 and 19). In any event, Mr Neil submitted that the colour photographs were the same as those which had been attached to Mr Hooke's letter to the court after the close of the hearing. Mr Neil submitted that the court should inspect the still photographs and compare them with the corresponding CCTV scenes to determine whether they were, in fact, in chronological order. 

172In my view, considerable caution should be exercised by the Court in the use it makes of the colour stills. It is clearly not possible to conclude that every frame shown on the CCTV footage has been extracted to make up the sequence of the still photographs. It is clear from my examination that some sequences are missing. The photos are of some limited use, however, in assessing some aspects of the assault by Schofield on both plaintiffs. 

173There are, for example, still photographs demonstrating that Schofield took hold of Christian, perhaps briefly, in a manner not detailed in the transit officers' statements. Photographs 9 to 15 show Christian apparently reprehending Schofield after that transit officer had lunged at Sebastian. Schofield places a hand on each of Christian's arms, and the two men come into close facial contact. Schofield then pushes Christian to one side while looking back towards Sebastian. Photograph 17 shows Christian being restrained by another officer, and apparently leaning or lunging towards Schofield. Thereafter, the photographs are not clear, although it seems that Christian was struggling and still attempting to get at Schofield (photographs 18 to 20). Photographs 21 to 23 show a number of the transit officers struggling with Christian. It is presumably after this that he falls to the ground and (see photograph 26) latches onto Schofield's leg. I have also examined and compared the moving images in the CCTV footage, and it is apparent that, while the still photographs are in apparent chronological order, they cannot be said to capture every movement of the participants' actions in full sequence. 

174There was some suggestion during the course of the oral argument that photograph 17 may have shown that the first blow administered by Schofield to Christian occurred while Christian was standing and confronting Schofield. Having carefully viewed both the still and moving images, I do not consider that this can be seen to be the situation. Rather, when the moving sequence is examined, it appears from this image that Christian is attempting to confront Schofield. It remains the position that Schofield's first contact with Christian was when he placed his hands on Christian's arms, and thrust him to one side while he continued to deal with Sebastian. The trial judge referred to this movement in his description of the material on the CCTV footage when he said: 

""Schofield is observed on the CCTV placing his hands on Christian's shoulders and pulling him in the direction of Showground Rd. Christian is then taken by four transit officers and lifted bodily with one leg dragging."" 

175Earlier, the trial judge had said: 

""... Christian grabbed Schofield around his lower leg and Schofield told him to let go three times. After the third time, Schofield hit Christian in the face area with an open backhand in what he described as a defensive action and he noticed blood on Christian's general mouth area after he was struck."" 

(This was a reference to the statement details taken from Transit Officer Blight). 

176Overall, I do not think there is anything demonstrated in the still photographs which casts doubt on the overall conclusions I have drawn from my examination of the CCTV footage. It is of interest to note, however, the time sequence involved in the giving of the directions to leave. The confrontation between the two brothers and the transit officers on the concourse area lasted about six minutes. It is clear that Schofield was present during approximately three minutes of that period, although for most of that time he appears to act merely as an observer, standing near Sanderson with his arms folded. It is likely that Schofield would have heard the directions given by Sanderson, or at least the second of those directions. 

177Mr Neil's submissions (in relation to both brothers) was that there was no real need to physically restrain the two men for the purposes of their removal. He referred to the number of transit officers who were either surrounding the brothers, or near them. He referred to the fact that neither brother demonstrated any act of physical aggression prior to Schofield's lunge at Sebastian. Finally, he submitted that none of the transit officers came to the assistance of either man when he was attacked by Schofield. In my opinion, there is no substance in any of these arguments. 

178A reasonable assessment of the events that occurred on the evening, and an evaluation of the need for physical removal, had to be considered against the realistic background of the situation. It is true that the loss of control by Schofield undoubtedly precipitated the immediate need to physically remove the brothers. Sanderson had been engaged in a long dialogue in an attempt to calm the brothers down and point out the unreasonableness of their behaviour. They had failed to respond in a reasonable fashion and, ultimately, Sanderson was forced to give directions for them to leave, the second being given in the face of mounting vocal aggression from the brothers. There was nothing in their conduct that indicated they were going to comply with that direction. Everything about their language and general belligerence dictated the inevitable potential for physical restraint and removal. 

179As I have said, Schofield's actions undoubtedly precipitated the seizure of the two brothers by the other officers, but that does not alter the fact that the two men were simply not going to obey the directions that had been given, and were inevitably going to require physical restraint and removal. Sebastian's threats to Schofield were a clear indication that the situation was at or near flashpoint. It is appropriate and necessary to assess the overall situation by having regard to the reality of the difficulties that confronted the officers, and the extreme pressure that was clearly building in that situation ( Woodley v Boyd [2001] NSWCA 35 at [37] per Heydon JA, cited with approval in Pringle v Everingham [2006] NSWCA 195; (2006) 46 MVR 58 at [67]; Carter v Walker [2010] VSCA 340 at [142]). It was open to the trial judge to find that physical restraint and removal was necessary. It was equally open to the trial judge to find that the force used by the transit officers in removing the brothers was reasonable. 

180A collateral challenge was made on this point by Mr Neil, when he submitted that Schofield's assault ""wiped the slate clean"" or ""interrupted' the procedural validity of the directions to leave that had been given. I would reject that submission also. The assault by Schofield, the seizure by the other officers, and the removal of the brothers all happened within seconds. In practical terms, Schofield's assault precipitated the need to seize and remove the brothers, but it did not undermine the validity of the directions that had been given, and the fact that the brothers were simply refusing to leave at the time they were seized. 

3. Was there an entitlement for the transit officers to arrest and detain the brothers until the police arrived? 

[Sebastian - Grounds 19 to 23; Christian - Grounds 20 to 25]. 

181There were three matters of substance argued in relation to these grounds. First, Mr Neil argued that there was no factual basis on which an arrest was required. Secondly, senior counsel submitted that there was no justifiable basis in law enlivening the power of a citizen's arrest. Thirdly, it was suggested that his Honour ought to have held that the transit officers' response was, in all the circumstances, excessive. 

182The first argument cannot be sustained. The trial judge made a detailed examination of the behaviour of both brothers in this regard. There is no need for me to set out the detail of these findings, as reference has been made to them already. The statements of Transit Officers Borchard, Sinha, and Singh contain ample illustration of the resistance offered by the appellants, their continued belligerent behaviour and, in the case of Sebastian, his attempts to re-enter the station. The resistance, offensive language and aggression continued, even after the police officers arrived. Indeed, it did not cease while the brothers were at the police station, a fact which no doubt contributed to their being placed in the cells there. 

183The second argument requires an examination of s 352(1)(a) of the Crimes Act . At the relevant time, this was the only power under which transit officers could operate for the purposes in making what was described in argument as ""a citizen's arrest"". Section 352(1)(a) of the Crimes Act has now been repealed by the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW). However, at the relevant time, it was in force, and provided as follows: 

"" 352 Person in act of committing or having committed an offence 

(1) Any constable or other person may without warrant apprehend, 

(a) any person in the act of committing, or immediately after having committed, an offence punishable, whether by indictment, or on summary conviction, under any Act, 

(b) any person who has committed a serious indictable offence for which the person has not been tried, 

and take the person, and any property found upon the person, before an authorised Justice to be dealt with according to law."" 

184In plain terms, the transit officers had the ability to arrest the brothers, as they plainly purported to do, but only if each was ""in the act of committing, or immediately after having committed"" an offence punishable, whether by indictment or summary conviction, under any Act. 

185The argument advanced before the trial judge, and in this court, was that the offences alleged against each appellant were only ""punishable"" under the Regulation. They were not ""punishable"" under an Act. 

186The trial judge rejected this argument. His Honour's reasoning appears to have been that the breaches of the Regulation were properly to be regarded as offences under the Rail Safety Act . He referred with approval to a submission made by counsel for the defendants that ""the power to make the regulations arose through s 95 of the Act, and without such power under the Act, the offences would not exist"". After examining the various arguments further, the trial judge said: 

""Insofar as it is relevant, I am satisfied that the breaches of the regulations referred to are properly regarded as offences under the Act."" 

187As I have said, Mr Neil argued that the power of citizen's arrest conferred by s 352(1)(a) of the Crimes Act did not extend to an arrest for an offence punishable under a rule, regulation, ordinance or by-law. Additionally, he argued that neither Sebastian nor Christian was in the act of committing, nor had he just committed, any breach of the Rail Safety (General) Regulation at the time each brother was seized. In the absence of the power to arrest, the seizure and detention of each brother by the respondents, it was argued, was a wrongful imprisonment, for which each brother was entitled to damages. 

188Quite apart from the reasons given by the trial judge, Mr Neil's argument seems to me, with all respect, to be misconceived. Senior counsel's argument is based on a construction of the section that suggests that a so-called ""citizen's arrest"" may only be made where a person has committed, or is committing, an offence punishable under an Act, as opposed to one punishable pursuant to a Regulation. He argued that, where a person has committed an offence in breach of a regulation, no power of arrest can arise. Although not stated explicitly in these terms, the argument advanced suggested that a distinction should be drawn between an offence that is created under an Act, as opposed to an offence which is created by a regulation. 

189In my opinion, the argument is misconceived because it overlooks the actual language used in the Rail Safety Act. 

190The starting point is the acknowledgement that, pursuant to s 352(1) of the Crimes Act , the type of offence that will, in the stipulated circumstances, justify an arrest is one where the offence is punishable, whether by indictment or on summary conviction, under any Act. The subsection focuses on the language in the relevant section of the Act under consideration, to determine whether the offence is one that is made punishable, whether by indictment or summary conviction. 

191Plainly enough, cls 13 and 59 of the Rail Safety (General) Regulation create offences, and do so under the auspices of s 95 of the Rail Safety Act . In the present case, each of the brothers had, on the findings of the trial judge, committed those offences. The question is - how were each of those offences dealt with in the Act? 

192Section 103 of the Rail Safety Act provides the answer to the question. It states that proceedings ""for an offence against this Act or the Regulations"" are to be disposed of ""in a summary manner before (a) a local court, or (b) the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction"". Thus, an offence against the Regulation is punishable on summary conviction, by virtue of s 103 of the Rail Safety Act . It may be safely said, accordingly, that each brother had been arrested immediately after having committed an offence that was punishable on summary conviction under the Rail Safety Act . In that situation, a power to arrest arose, which was available for use against both Sebastian and Christian. 

193The trial judge had accepted the arguments of the respondent, that the power to make the Regulations arose under s 95 of the Act. His Honour concluded that ""without such power under the Act the offences would not exist"". This is undoubtedly correct, but I am not sure that it precisely answered the argument advanced by trial counsel on the plaintiffs' behalf. However, that argument was, for the reasons I have given, misconceived. In my view, the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants, both at trial and on this appeal, cannot succeed. 

194The third and final argument was that the manner of arrest of each brother could not be said to be a measured response by the respondents to the conduct, such as it was, of the brothers. In this regard, Mr Neil argued that it is of the utmost importance that police officers know and observe the conditions for a valid arrest ( Re Bolton; Ex Parte Beane [1987] HCA 12; (1987) 162 CLR 514 at 523 per Brennan J and 528-529 per Deane J; State of New South Wales v Riley [2003] NSWCA 208 at [141] per Hodgson JA). A fortiori, senior counsel argued, authorised officers under the Rail Safety Act must also know and observe these limits. 

195The issue here is essentially one of fact. I am satisfied that it was open to the trial judge to conclude as he did. He was not satisfied that excessive force had been used. He took into account the fact that the brothers were held on the ground and then ""sat upon to stop them thrashing around"". He also took into account that handcuffs had been applied to restrain them. 

196It is simply not realistic to argue, as did the appellants, that the objective of ensuring compliance with the directions that had been given could have been achieved by simply blocking Sebastian's path to the station, and delivering an oral direction to both brothers to ""go away"". It is clear that the officers were engaged, at one time, in two pursuits. They were attempting to remove the brothers from railway land for failure to obey valid directions, consequent upon breaches of cl 13 of the Rail Safety (General) Regulation. At the same time, the officers purported to arrest the brothers in respect of that failure to comply, and to restrain them pending the arrival of the police officers. In my view, it was open to the trial judge to find that the arrest was lawful in each case. It was also open to him to find that, in the absence of restraint, and had re-entry been achieved, further breaches of the Regulation were likely to occur, particularly having regard to the intoxicated state and the aggressive and abusive behaviour of each of the brothers. It was open to his Honour to find that the time of restraint was not unduly protracted, and that the method used by the transit officers to restrain them was a reasonable application of force in those circumstances. That question had to be judged by reference to the ""pressure of events and the agony of the moment, and not by reference to hindsight"" ( Woodley v Boyd at [37]; Pringle v Everingham at [67]). 

4. Injurious falsehood 

[Sebastian - Grounds 25 to 29; Christian - Grounds 26 to 30]. 

197The appellants complained that Borchard and Schofield made false representations of, and concerning, each of the brothers. In trial exhibit F, Constable Baker had stated that: 

""Borchard informed me that he saw the two males drinking and smoking on the platform. He also informed me that they did not have a rail pass."" 

198These statements were false, it was said, in a number of respects. First, Christian was never smoking at any time on the evening. Sebastian was smoking, not on the platform, but on the railway concourse above. Similarly, although both men were drinking, they were drinking on the concourse and not on the platform. 

199Trial exhibit G contains statements made by Schofield to Senior Constable Lewis: 

""We've had a problem with those two guys. They're both drunk, were on railway property without tickets, have been smoking and swearing on the platform and they refused to leave when we told them."" 

(Later, Schofield corrected the statement to police when he made it clear that Christian had not been smoking). 

200The false statements alleged here were that the smoking and swearing was on the platform, whereas it had in fact occurred on the concourse above. 

201The tort of injurious falsehood has been described as ""a rare and anomalous tort"": G. Sawer, ""Second Thoughts on Defamation"", Nation , 20 December 1958 at 6, cited in WL Morrison, ""The New Law of Verbal Injury"", 3 Sydney Law Review (195 -1961) at 4. One of the rare occasions when it has been considered by the High Court of Australia was in Palmer-Bruyn & Parker Pty Ltd v Parsons . Gummow J said, at 405: 

""The tort of 'injurious falsehood' (a term coined by Salmond) has its origins in actions for 'slander of title'. This involved aspersions cast upon the plaintiff's ownership of land which resulted in the plaintiff being unable to lease or sell the land. Despite the use of the term 'slander' and its 'unfortunate' association with the law of defamation, 'slander of title' appears to have been recognised as an action on the case for the special damage resulting from the defendant's interference. The action was slowly enlarged in the nineteenth century, until the position was reached in 1892 where, in Ratcliffe v Evans (1892) 2 QB 524 at 527-528, the modern foundation of the tort was established."" 

202Gummow J listed the elements of the action at 404: 

""Thus, generally, it is said that an action for injurious falsehood has four elements: (1) a false statement of or concerning the plaintiff's goods or business; (2) publication of that statement by the defendant to a third person; (3) malice on the part of the defendant; and (4) proof by the plaintiff of actual damage (which may include a general loss of business) suffered as a result of the statement."" 

203At 425, Kirby J stated his opinion of the ""seven elements of the tort"". These were expressed as follows: 

""(1) That the defendant published matter that was false; 

(2) That the falsity concerned the plaintiff or its property; 

(3) That such falsity was calculated to induce others not to deal with the plaintiff or was otherwise likely to damage the plaintiff; 

(4) That the publication was actuated by malice; 

(5) That the publication had the results complained of; 

(6) That those results included actual damage to the plaintiff; and 

(7) That such damage was either: 

(a) The result which the person publishing the false matter intended; or 

(b) The natural and probable result of such publication."" 

204One aspect of the difference between the elements as stated separately by Gummow and Kirby JJ was whether the case before the High Court raised for consideration the question as to how far the action for injurious falsehood extended to concepts of business or property. Gleeson CJ noted, at 393, that the particular matter did not fall for actual consideration. He referred to his earlier decision in the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Ballina Shire Council v Ringland (1994) 33 NSWLR 680 at 692-693. In that case, Gleeson CJ had allowed for the possibility that the tort might extend beyond the scope of an action that depended on disparagement of property or business. 

205In Palmer-Bruyn & Parker Pty Ltd v Parsons, the High Court held (Callinan J dissenting) that reasonable foreseeability is not part of an action for injurious falsehood. In the course of that decision, however, Gummow J, like Gleeson CJ, found it unnecessary to decide whether the tort was broad enough "" to include any damaging falsehood which interferes with 'prospective advantage, even of a non-commercial nature' with the consequence that the confinement of the first element to 'the goods or business' of the plaintiff might be considered too narrowly expressed"" (at 407). Gummow J indicated that the matter had not been argued before the High Court, and that it was therefore not necessary to decide for present purposes. 

206I will assume, without deciding, that the tort of injurious falsehood is available to the plaintiffs in the present matter, on the basis that false representations were allegedly made by the two transit officers to the police concerning each plaintiff. This particular aspect of the tort was not argued before this Court, nor was it raised for our consideration. 

207Nevertheless, it is clear that the trial judge was perfectly justified in finding that the plaintiffs had failed to establish the elements of this tort. I have earlier set out the reasoning of the trial judge, and there is no need to repeat it. It is true that Christian had not been smoking on railway premises, but that was corrected by Schofield when he spoke to the police. It was true also that the brothers had not, in fact, reached the platform but, as the trial judge noted, had at one point passed through the barriers leading to the platform. There was no issue that both brothers were well affected by alcohol, had refused to comply with a direction to leave and had used offensive language on railway land. It was also no issue that the brothers did not have tickets for travel and were insisting, nevertheless, on travelling by train if they could get to the platform. As to the latter matter, the submissions by Mr Neil are possibly correct in that the facts may have failed to establish breach of a regulation for attempting to travel by train: R v Mai & Anor (1992) 26 NSWLR 371 at 381-382. On the other hand, the brothers' passage through the barriers into the restricted area above the platform may have taken the situation beyond mere ""intent"" to travel without tickets. Be that as it may, it was plainly open to the trial judge to determine that the way in which the matters were reported to the police did not demonstrate malice. The prosecution for attempting to travel by train without a ticket may not have succeeded, but that, of itself, could not establish malice. 

208In this context, malice has been said to be ""not easy to define"": Schindler Lifts Australian Pty Ltd v Debelak (1989) 89 ALR 275 at 291 per Pincus J. In a passage from Fleming's Law of Torts, 9 th ed (1998) Thompson Reuters at 780, the author, in tracing the history of the word in this context, said: 

""Later, however, malice came to be treated as a necessary element even when no question of privilege was involved; and today the dominant view seems to be that malice, in the sense of some indirect, dishonest or improper motive, or at any rate an intent to injure without just cause or excuse must be proved by the plaintiff."" 

209On this basis, it could not be said on the facts in the present case that the transit officers, in reporting the breaches to the police, acted with malice, and the judge rightly so found. 

210In addition, his Honour held that the plaintiffs had failed to prove special damage. Indeed, from my reading of the pleadings, it does not seem that any special damage was claimed. There was a faint attempt, during the hearing of the appeal, to argue that Christian may have incurred a loss of wages in attending court on two to three occasions before the penalty notices were ultimately dismissed. The claim on behalf of Sebastian was abandoned altogether. 

211While there is a fleeting reference in the transcript to Christian's attendance at court, and the fact that he may have lost some wages as a consequence, there was no direct evidence, or specific evidence, to this effect. Indeed, the defendants had tendered exhibit X at trial. That document demonstrated that, in the relevant period, Christian had not lost any wages as a result of any aspect of his claim against the defendants. The trial judge expressly found that the plaintiffs had failed to establish special damage, and he was entitled to do so. 

212In my view, Christian has failed to establish any error on this aspect of the appeal. 

Damages 

[Sebastian - Grounds 12 to 18; Christian - Grounds 11, 13 to 19] 

213The damage grounds pressed at the hearing of the appeal may be succinctly stated. They were, in general terms, common to the appeals of both Sebastian and Christian. First, the award of general damages was in each case said to be inadequate. Secondly, the aggravated damages awarded were said to be inadequate. Moreover, this second aspect of compensatory damages was claimed to be based on wrong principles, and the quantum improperly reduced by an irrelevant factor, namely the ""belligerent and offensive conduct"" of the brothers. It was also argued, consistently with the earlier grounds, that general and aggravated damages should have been awarded against a number of the transit officers, and not merely against Schofield. Thirdly, it was said that the trial judge erred in respect of his failure to award exemplary damages against Schofield and, by dint of vicarious liability, against RailCorp. These purported errors were based on a number of individual arguments, which I shall assess in the course of these reasons. Given the nature of the grounds, it will be appropriate to deal with exemplary damages first, and then consider the issues in relation to compensatory damages. 

Exemplary damages 

214In Australian law, an award of exemplary damages is intended to punish the defendant and also to deter the defendant, and others, from behaving in the same or similar reprehensible manner. The objects of such an award encompass condemnation and admonition of the defendant and his behaviour. The purpose of damages of this kind is to mark out the court's strong disapproval of the conduct and to visit retribution on the person thus sanctioned. It also embraces the notion that such an award will assuage the victim's potential desire or need for revenge and thus avoid any temptation to engage in self-help likely to endanger the peace. Lamb v Cotogno [1987] HCA 47; 164 CLR 1 at 8-13; Uren v John Fairfax and Sons Pty Limited [1966] HCA 40; 117 CLR 118 at 138; Luntz, Assessment of Damages for Personal Injury and Death: General Principles (2006) LexisNexus Butterworths [7.2] at 98-99. 

215The type of conduct that will attract an award of exemplary damages has been described as ""conduct showing a conscious and contumelious disregard for the plaintiff's rights"": XL Petroleum NSW Pty Ltd v Caltex Oil (Aust) Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 12; 155 CLR 448 at 472 per Brennan J. It has plainly been recognised in cases where trespass to the person has been alleged against police officers who have been shown to have acted in a high-handed and contumelious fashion: Adams v Kennedy [2000] NSWCA 152; 49 NSWLR 78; Knight v State of New South Wales [2004] NSWSC 791 per Hoeben J. 

216In Lamb v Cotogno , at 8, the High Court cited with approval the following passage from Mayne and McGregor on Damages, 12 th ed (1961) Sweet & Maxwell: 

""[Exemplary damages] can apply only where the conduct of the defendant merits punishment, which is only considered to be so where his conduct is wanton, as where it discloses fraud, malice, violence, cruelty, insolence or the like, or, as it is sometimes put, where he acts in contumelious disregard of the plaintiff's rights."" 

217The trial judge, in the instant case, made it clear that he did not regard either case as appropriate for an award of exemplary damages. His Honour correctly identified that, to qualify for such an award, the defendant's conduct must be of such a character that it merits punishment. In the catalogue of the types of conduct that might merit such an award, his Honour included a number of the epithets that have been referred to in both the authorities I have mentioned, and in the textbooks. For example, his Honour considered whether the behaviour of Schofield had been ""knowingly wanton, fraudulent, malicious, violent, cruel, high-handed or an abuse of power"". 

218I take the trial judge's reference to these epithets, and the general tenor of his observations, fairly read, as indicating that he did not think the behaviour of Schofield fell within the type of conduct that called for an award of exemplary damages to represent punishment, admonition, retribution and the like. Indeed, that appears to be the primary basis for his Honour's decision not to award exemplary damages. 

219Another matter his Honour regarded as relevant to the issue of exemplary damages was ""the abusive and belligerent behaviour"" of the plaintiffs. In addition, he took into consideration the circumstances of the criminal proceedings brought against Schofield and, in addition, the fact that Schofield had been the subject of disciplinary proceedings and suspended from his employment. 

220As a preliminary to all of these matters, his Honour indicated that he kept in mind that ""the power to award [exemplary] damages should be exercised with restraint"". 

221I shall now list the range of errors asserted by the appellants in relation to the issue of exemplary damages. First, Mr Neil argued that it was an error of law for the trial judge to indicate that he would keep in mind the proposition that the power to award exemplary damages should be exercised with restraint. Secondly, senior counsel argued that the trial judge had failed to examine the penalty imposed on Schofield in the criminal proceedings, and failed to evaluate whether it was so substantial as to warrant exemplary damages being withheld. In that regard, Mr Neil relied upon Gray v Motor Accident Commission [1998] HCA 70; 196 CLR 1 at 13-17. 

222In relation to the trial judge's reference to the criminal proceedings against Schofield, Mr Neil pointed out that, although the transit officer had been found guilty of the assaults in the Local Court criminal proceedings, the prosecution of Sebastian was later dismissed under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . In Christian's case, the conviction entered against Schofield in the Local Court was subsequently quashed in the District Court. Senior counsel also argued that the reference by the trial judge to the disciplinary proceedings brought against Schofield constituted a further error of law. 

223Mr Neil submitted that none of these matters, neither the criminal proceedings nor the disciplinary proceedings, justified the withholding of exemplary damages from the plaintiffs. 

224Finally, Mr Neil argued that RailCorp ought to have had exemplary damages awarded against it, to bring home to it that its transit officers must be trained and disciplined to ensure that abuses of the kind that had occurred in the present case would not be repeated. In this regard, senior counsel relied upon New South Wales v Ibbett [2006] HCA 57; 229 CLR 638. 

225This last argument raises a point of some difficulty. The issue is whether a non-State agency is to be held vicariously liable for the contumelious action of its employees, especially in circumstances where the claim makes no allegation alleging a failure in training and discipline. State of New South Wales v Ibbett had dealt with the liability of the State for actions of police officers, having regard to the special provisions in s 6 of the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 (NSW). It did not directly deal with the points raised by Mr Neil's argument. 

226I shall deal with each of the arguments separately. The first, and to my mind the most important, matter is whether the conduct of Schofield merited an award of exemplary damages at all. The trial judge thought it did not, and I consider that his decision in this regard was entirely correct. An analysis of the CCTV footage, and the statements from the various transit officers, show that Schofield had been present during the attempts by Sanderson to make the brothers listen to reason, and at the same time, to curb their behaviour and language. Schofield had been involved with the brothers during two earlier incidents that evening, but they had been resolved relatively amicably. Schofield observed and listened to the brothers arguing with the transit officers for about three minutes, standing with his arms folded, quite near to both brothers and Sanderson. He then gave a direction to both men to leave the station. The CCTV footage shows him pointing away from the station. Sebastian said (according to one source), ""I'll kill you, you fucking cunts. I'm not leaving the station"". According to another transit officer, Schofield was told by Sebastian, ""I will fucking smash you"". Both brothers had been described as using offensive language and speaking aggressively during the period of being spoken to by Sanderson on the concourse area. It was immediately after the aggressive language used by Sebastian that Schofield lunged at him. Schofield grabbed Sebastian by the throat and, in the melee, Sebastian's shirt was torn. He suffered no other injuries. 

227Security Officer Riley said that, at that point, ""the youngest one"" (clearly Christian) stepped in and started to ""swear and yell"" at the transit officers. He then described Christian being forced to the ground. It was in that rapidly evolving situation that Schofield committed the assaults on Christian. Christian received a cut lip in the assault, but no other injuries. The assault by Schofield on both brothers was over very quickly, and they were then carried or dragged away from the concourse area. 

228There was, of course, no justification for Schofield's assault on the brothers, and the judge so found. However, it is quite clear that Schofield simply lost his temper. The expression, aptly used by Mr Neil during his submissions, was that Schofield ""snapped"". Of course, in some cases, provocation and loss of temper may result in behaviour that is so contumelious that it will warrant an award of exemplary damages. In this case, however, Schofield's sudden loss of control plainly occurred in the context of the aggressive and offensive remarks by Sebastian and, to a lesser extent, the language and response of Christian after his elder brother had been assaulted. There was no warning given to the other officers that Schofield would ""snap"" as he did and his behaviour was curtailed, or at least restrained to some degree by them. In my opinion, it was well open to the trial judge to find on the present facts that Schofield's behaviour, although unjustified and warranting an award of compensatory damages, did not justify an award of exemplary damages. As Windeyer J counselled in Uren v John Fairfax and Sons Pty Limited at 153: 

""... exemplary damages must always be based upon something more substantial than a jury's mere disapproval of the conduct of a defendant."" 

229Windeyer J, at 153-154, further cautioned that ""matters that may aggravate compensatory damages do not of themselves justify the addition or inclusion or a further purely punitive element"". His Honour warned against the use of ""epithets without evidence"". 

230During the appeal hearing, Mr Neil introduced a further matter in relation to this argument. He referred to portions of the statement of CSA Truskett. It was she who had witnessed the earlier incident between Security Officer Riley and the brothers. It was she who warned the transit officers in the staff room that they should be careful, and that one of the brothers ""may be looking for a blue"". However, her statement had also identified one of the transit officers (presumably Schofield) saying to the others, ""Come on, boys, let's go and have some fun"". Mr Neil suggested that this remark was highly relevant on the damages issues and generally relevant as to the attitude of the other officers. I do not agree. It is clear that this remark by Schofield occurred at an early stage of the evening. It occurred before Schofield, Sinha and Jimenez spoke to the brothers about drinking on the concourse, and subsequently, to Sebastian about smoking on the concourse. Both of those issues were resolved relatively amicably and without any inappropriate behaviour by Schofield. The remark in the staff room had no temporal or other connection with the assault by Schofield later in the evening. It was not endorsed or commented upon by any of the other officers. 

231Accordingly, I would conclude that it was entirely open to the trial judge to reach the view that exemplary damages were not appropriate in this matter, having regard to the conduct of Schofield. His Honour was also entitled to take into account the behaviour of both Sebastian and Christian as a relevant factor on the issue as to whether such damages should be awarded: Lamb v Cotogno at 13 ; Fontin v Katapodis [1962] HCA 63; (1962) 108 CLR 177. 

232Further, I do not think that his Honour was in error in reminding himself that restraint was necessary before embarking on a factual evaluation as to whether exemplary damages were necessary in the present matter. Australian courts have, in the main, accepted that the power to award exemplary damages should be exercised rarely and with restraint: XL Petroleum NSW Pty Ltd v Caltex Oil (Aust) Pty Ltd at 463 per Gibbs CJ; TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd v Anning [2002] NSWCA 82; (2002) 54 NSWLR 333 at 366 per Spigelman CJ. 

233I turn next to the arguments based on the criminal and disciplinary proceedings brought against Schofield. Mr Neil argued that the judge had erred in law by taking these matters into account on the issue as to whether exemplary damages should be awarded. 

234The first argument related to the criminal proceedings. The factual basis on which the judge considered this matter is set out in detail in the judgment. It bears repetition. Schofield was prosecuted in the Local Court for the assaults on the two brothers. It appears he was convicted in relation to each assault, and then appealed to the District Court. In relation to the assault on Christian, the conviction was set aside, and Schofield was found not guilty. In relation to Sebastian's assault, the finding of guilt was confirmed, but the proceedings were dismissed under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

235In Gray v Motor Accident Commission , the High Court gave consideration to the factors that may be invoked when a court considers whether exemplary damages should be awarded. In particular, the Court dealt with the relevance or otherwise of the situation where criminal punishment had been imposed on a wrongdoer who was later sued by an injured person. In that case, the driver of a motor car who had seriously injured the plaintiff was subsequently convicted of intentionally causing grievous bodily harm, and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. Although not relevant to the present discussion, there were two points of special interest to note regarding the case. The first was that the third-party insurer was the defendant, being substituted under South Australian legislation as the defendant. Secondly, although the claim was based on negligence, the conduct of the proceedings at trial demonstrated that the case had properly been regarded as one of conscious wrongdoing by a tortfeasor. 

236The trial judge had made no award of exemplary damages. The factor which appeared to influence him significantly was that the tortfeasor had been ""substantially punished by imprisonment"". 

237Prior to considering this issue, the plurality judgment stated, at 15:- 

""In considering whether to award exemplary damages, the first, if not the principal focus of the injury is upon the wrongdoer, not upon the party who was wronged. (The reaction of the party who is wronged to high-handed or deliberate conduct may well be a reason for awarding aggravated damages in further compensation for the wrong done. But it is not ordinarily relevant to whether exemplary damages should be allowed). The party wronged is entitled to whatever compensatory damages the law allows (including, if appropriate, aggravated damages). By hypothesis then, the party wronged will receive just compensation for the wrong that is suffered. If exemplary damages are awarded, they will be paid in addition to compensatory damages, and, in that sense, will be a windfall in the hands of the party who was wronged. Nevertheless, they are awarded at the suit of that party, and, although awarded to punish the wrongdoer and deter others from like conduct, they are not extracted by the State or paid by it."" 

238On the issue of the significance of criminal punishment, the plurality judgment emphatically endorsed the proposition that, where the criminal law has been brought to bear upon the wrongdoer and substantial punishment inflicted upon him, the consequence is that exemplary damages may not be awarded in the civil proceedings. In their Honours' view, the infliction of substantial punishment (for what was substantially the same conduct as the conduct the subject of the civil proceedings) is a complete bar to the award. It is not a matter of discretion depending on the facts and circumstances in the case. Two reasons were given for this. First, the purpose for the awarding of exemplary damages will have been wholly met if substantial punishment is extracted by the criminal law; second, considerations of double punishment would otherwise arise. 

239In the case then under consideration, the High Court determined that imprisonment for seven years constituted substantial punishment and, as this had been imposed on the wrongdoer for the conduct the subject of the civil action, exemplary damages could not be awarded. The plurality judgment left open the situation where a wrongdoer had been found guilty, but where a financial or non-custodial penalty had been prescribed. It left open also the situation where a wrongdoer has been brought before the criminal courts and acquitted. Equally, it left open the situation where there might properly arise a real issue as to whether the punishment inflicted upon a wrongdoer was adequate or otherwise. The plurality judgment, in each of those situations, did not conclude one way or the other whether the imposition of the criminal law would be a bar to exemplary damages. 

240Kirby J (in a separate decision) thought that the issue was one of discretion. At 33-34, Kirby J said: 

""I accept that describing the process involved as ""discretionary"" may encourage a certain looseness of thinking. However, to some extent that is inherent in the interaction of criminal punishment and civil damages which are described as being in part punitive. It is a discretion to be exercised in accordance with principle. If one of the reasons for awarding exemplary damages is the punishment of the wrongdoer in an emphatic and public way, it is obviously relevant to take into account the fact that this may already have been done or is likely to follow. Once exemplary damages are seen as supplementary to compensatory damages (an addition that may or may not be appropriate in the particular case) the fact that a plaintiff may lose them (or have them reduced by reference to the actions of others in the criminal courts) does no offence to reason. The primary judge's description of exemplary damages as discretionary was therefore correct."" 

241In my opinion, contrary to Mr Neil's submission, there is nothing in the plurality judgment that suggests that, where substantial punishment (for example, imprisonment) has not been imposed, the trial court is precluded from taking into account, as a relevant factor in determining whether exemplary damages should be awarded and, if so, the extent of those damages, the fact that a wrongdoer has been subjected to the rigours of the criminal justice system for the same conduct as is involved in the civil case. Kirby J's separate decision plainly envisages that such an approach is permissible. 

242In other words, the High Court's decision in Gray is authority for the proposition that, where substantial punishment has been imposed by the criminal justice system for the same conduct as is involved in the civil proceedings, this will operate as a complete bar to the grant of exemplary damages. Where ""substantial punishment"" has not been imposed, or where it is arguable that it has not, there is no reason why the trial judge cannot have some regard to the nature of those proceedings and their outcome as a factor, amongst others, in determining whether or not to award exemplary damages. 

243In the present appeals, I can discern no error in the trial judge's approach. As I have said earlier, his Honour's primary reasoning appears to proceed on the basis that the conduct of Schofield itself was not such that it warranted an award of exemplary damages. That, I think, is clear from the structure of his Honour's judgment. 

244Against the background of that finding, his Honour then took into account three further matters. These he regarded as ""also of relevance"". They were, first, the abusive and belligerent behaviour of the plaintiffs themselves, and second, the nature of the criminal proceedings brought against Schofield. A third matter was the disciplinary proceedings which I shall mention shortly. 

245I have already referred to the abusive and belligerent behavior of the plaintiffs. It could be taken into account for its part in Schofield's loss of temper. That is not to deny exemplary damages because of the plaintiff's conduct. Rather, it is to address the nature of the defendant's conduct. It goes to the nature of the defendant's conduct and in my view his Honour took it into account in that way. 

246So far as the criminal proceedings are concerned, there is no doubt that, in the case of Sebastian, there was a finding of guilt, both in the Local Court and the District Court on appeal. The order made, and its precise terms, was not, however, in evidence before the trial judge. It was simply agreed between the parties that the conviction for the assault had been quashed, pursuant to the provisions of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act . His Honour said that, notwithstanding that the conviction was quashed in these circumstances, this matter ""would remain on Schofield's criminal record, and in that sense, might be regarded as a punishment as a result of the events of that evening"". 

247It might be noted, although it was not discussed by his Honour, that s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) is in these terms: 

""10(1) Without proceeding to conviction, the court that finds a person guilty of an offence may make any one of the following orders: 

(a) an order direction that the relevant charge be dismissed, 

(b) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into a good behaviour bond for a term no exceeding two years, 

(c) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into an agreement to participate in an intervention programme and to comply with any intervention plan arising out of the programme."" 

248As I have noted, the precise basis on which the s 10 order was made was not in evidence. Presumably, had it been the fact that a s 10(1)(b) bond was imposed, for example, that may have been a relevant matter for consideration. 

249The legislation enables a court, in determining whether to make an order under s 10, to take into account the offender's character, antecedents, age and health. It may take into account the trivial nature of the offence, and any extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed. Even though no conviction is recorded, the order has the same effect as a conviction for certain purposes: for example, for the purposes of enabling a court to order compensation in favour of the victim under the Victims Compensation Act 1996 (NSW). 

250In my opinion, it was appropriate for his Honour to take into account the situation, so far as the criminal proceedings in connection with Sebastian's assault, were concerned. This was because it was relevant to see whether the processes of the criminal law had been brought to bear on Schofield, and to determine whether or not, in any sense, he had been punished as a result of his assaults. The trial judge was able to conclude that he had been. It was not so much a question of the adequacy of the punishment, but the fact that he had been successfully prosecuted under the criminal law, and found guilty. His Honour did not treat this fact as determinative of the outcome on the issue of exemplary damages, but merely took it into account as one relevant factor. He did not regard it as a complete bar to the award of damages. In my opinion, it was not an error of law to rely on the matter in the way he did. 

251The position in relation to Christian was somewhat different. As I have said, Schofield had been convicted of the assault on Christian in the Local Court. However, on appeal in the District Court, he was found not guilty. His Honour noted that fact, but otherwise made no comment about it. There was no evidence before the trial judge as to the reasons for the acquittal. Nor is there any material before the court on that issue. It may simply be, for whatever reason, that the prosecution was simply unable to prove the charge to the requisite standard of criminal proof. I do not, however, consider that his Honour fell into any error by taking into account, as relevant on the issue, the fact of the criminal proceedings relating to the assault on Christian, and their outcome. Once again, his Honour clearly did not see this as a matter that, in itself, prohibited the imposition of exemplary damages. It was no more than a factor to be taken into account, with others, in the assessment of that issue. Indeed, in relation to both brothers, the criminal proceedings involving Schofield were not identified as being of any particular significance. As factors going to the discretion as to whether exemplary damages, they were of a minor nature and were seen as such in assessing the overall situation. 

252The fact that Schofield was the subject of disciplinary proceedings and suspended from his employment was also a matter that, in my opinion, his Honour correctly regarded as relevant to the issue of whether exemplary damages should be awarded. As I have explained, those circumstances were by no means determinative of the issue, and his Honour did not treat them in that way. They too were minor matters in the ultimate evaluation. An adverse order made against a person in disciplinary proceedings, even a temporary suspension order, has the capacity to affect his or her employment, both with a present employer and future employers. Although not criminal punishment, it can rightly be regarded as some type of punishment, possibly very real punishment, for the purposes of assessing whether exemplary damages should be imposed and, if so, the relevant quantum of those damages. (On the issue of disciplinary orders being regarded as punishment: see Rich v ASIC [2003] NSWCA 342; 183 FLR 361 at 411; Police Service Board v Morris [1985] HCA 9; 156 CLR 397 at 403 per Gibbs CJ). In the present matter, as I have said, it could only play a minor role and it is clear that it did. 

253The final matter relied upon by Mr Neil in relation to this aspect of the damages argument was the proposition that exemplary damages should have been awarded against RailCorp, on the basis that it had failed to train and discipline its transit officers, including Schofield, to prevent the type of abuse represented by his assaults. In view of the findings the trial judge made relating to the inapplicability of exemplary damages against Schofield and the correctness of those findings, this matter does not arise for consideration. That is especially so when regard is had to the fact that no claim of that kind appears in the pleadings. 

Compensatory damages 

254The trial judge awarded $5,000 general damages in favour of Sebastian, and $7,000 in favour of Christian. Each brother received a further award of $5,000 in aggravated damages. Mr Neil complained about the quantum of each of these awards. As to the general complaint that the level of damages in favour of each of the brothers was too low, no particular matter was identified that would justify this court's intervention in the assessment of damages. The trial judge found that, so far as Sebastian is concerned, apart from his torn shirt, he was not satisfied that he had sustained any physical injury as a consequence of Schofield's assault. The assault was restricted to the acts of Schofield lunging at Sebastian, coming into contact with his neck or throat, ripping his shirt and forcing him to the ground. There was no claim for property damage. His Honour recognised that the assault on Sebastian was ""a frightening experience"". He acknowledged also that it was ""unnecessary and unjustified"". In those circumstances, the award of $5,000 for general damages was a reasonable one. 

255The trial judge, by comparison, recognised that Christian had been subjected to a more serious assault than that inflicted upon his brother. He had been struck two or three times in the face and mouth regions, causing his lip to bleed. His head was slammed into the ground. However, his Honour found that, apart from the injury to his lip, there were no injuries sustained by Christian as a consequence of Schofield's assault. The award of $7,000 in favour of Christian in general damages should not be disturbed. Both awards, although low, were within a reasonable range in the circumstances found by the trial judge. 

256So far as the judge said that damages may be awarded where the defendant has acted in committing a tort with contumelious disregard for the plaintiff's rights in an insulting or high-handed way or with malice, there was some confusion with the basis for an award of exemplary damages. However, the confusion did not operate against the appellants, since his Honour considered that Schofield's actions were high-handed; and he then correctly addressed the relevant basis for aggravated damages, namely that those high-handed actions would have increased the appellant's suffering, warranting an award of aggravated damages. In dealing with Sebastian's claim in this way, his Honour correctly recognised the distinction between aggravated damages and exemplary damages. The passage, read in the context of the full decision, shows that his Honour was well aware of the conceptual distinction between the compensatory nature of aggravated damages, and the punitive and deterrent nature of exemplary damages. It also needs to be recalled that ""in many cases, the same set of circumstances might well justify either an award of exemplary or aggravated damages"" ( Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd per Taylor J at 130). In short, it is quite clear that the trial judge recognised that aggravated damages are awarded to compensate the plaintiff for increased mental suffering due to the manner in which the defendant has behaved in committing the wrong. Aggravated damages, it has been said, are intended to compensate the injured plaintiff because the more reprehensible the wrongdoer's conduct, the greater the indignity the plaintiff suffers and the greater the outrage to his or her feelings ( Uren v John Fairfax& Sons Pty Ltd per Windeyer J at 151). 

257Mr Neil argued that it was wrong for the trial judge to take into consideration the ""provocative behaviour of the plaintiffs and their belligerence"" in assessing aggravated damages. From the material I have earlier referred to, there was ample evidence to justify his Honour's findings that both brothers had repeatedly used offensive language and acted in a manner that might properly be described as belligerent. It is true that they had not demonstrated any physical violence towards the transit officers prior to the assaults, but their overall attitude and conduct was properly described as belligerent. I do not consider that the trial judge fell into error by taking this matter into account on the issue of the quantum of aggravated damages. Fontin v Katapodis is authority for the proposition that provocation does not have the effect of reducing ""actual"" compensatory damages, that is, damages for medical expenses, loss of earning capacity and non-pecuniary loss that is not aggravated by the defendant's conduct. On the other hand, although aggravated damages are correctly described as compensatory, such damages may be reduced if the plaintiff's conduct has been provocative, since all the circumstances must be taken into account in determining the hurt to the plaintiff's feelings, and such circumstances include the fact that the plaintiff's own behaviour may have brought the attack on himself: Fontin v Katapodis at 183 per McTiernan J; Horkin v Port Melbourne Football Club Social Club [1983] 1 VR 153 at 162 per Brooking J; O'Connor v Hewitson & Anor [1979] Crim LR 46; Hill v Cooke [1958] SR (NSW) 49. 

258The findings made by the trial judge did not suggest that Schofield was in any way entitled to assault either of the brothers as he did. It was unjustified and unnecessary, as the trial judge found. Nevertheless, the behaviour of both Sebastian and Christian was quite unwarranted, and justified the giving of directions for their removal from the railway station. Both brothers made it completely clear that they were not going to leave, and it was in those circumstances that they were seized and physically escorted from the premises. It is true that Schofield's assault precipitated the removal process, but it did not alter the fact that the brothers were going to have to be physically restrained and removed in any event. His Honour was entitled to bring their behaviour to bear in assessing the award for aggravated damages. 

259For the reasons I have given, none of the arguments which have sought to attack each award of damages can succeed. 

Interest 

[Sebastian - Ground 30; Christian Ground 31] 

260Sebastian and Christian have each argued that the trial judge erred in law in not awarding any interest on damages. It was submitted that the trial judge had not advanced any reasons as to why each appellant was not entitled to interest on those damages. It seems to be common ground between the parties, however, that the failure to award interest was simply an oversight. It would have been possible for the appellants to have approached the judge to ask, pursuant to the slip rule, that the question of interest be addressed: L Shaddock & Associates Pty Ltd v Parramatta City Council [No 2] [1982] HCA 59; (1982) 151 CLR 590. It appears that this was not done. The respondents do not, however, take any point on this issue, and it is common ground that this court should remedy the situation. Christian's calculation of interest is $2,201.28 at 4%, or $1,100.64 at the lower rate. The comparable figures in the case of Sebastian are $1,834.40 or $917.20. 

261In the circumstances of the nature of the assault on each brother, and given that there were no later consequences in each case, it will be appropriate to award the higher amount of interest claimed by each appellant. This will be addressed at the conclusion of these reasons. 

Costs 

[Sebastian - Grounds 31 to 38; Christian Grounds 32 to 38] 

262There were two separate bases for the attack on the trial judge's costs orders. First, it was argued that his Honour erred in declining to make either a Bullock or Sanderson order against RailCorp in respect of the costs ordered against the brothers in favour of the remaining transit officers who had unsuccessfully been sued. Secondly, it was argued that the trial judge had fallen into error in relation to the indemnity costs orders he made against each appellant. 

Bullock order 

263So far as the first matter is concerned, I am not satisfied that any basis has been demonstrated upon which it would have been proper for the trial judge to order RailCorp to pay, either directly or indirectly, the costs ordered against the appellants in relation to the proceedings against the successful transit officers. In Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 75; (1985) 157 CLR 215, Gibbs CJ said at 229: 

""The ground on which a Bullock order may be made is in my opinion, more accurately stated in a passage in Sanderson v Blyth Theatre Co. [1903] 2 KB 533 at 539, which was cited with approval in Bullock v London General Omnibus Co. [1907] 1 KB 264 at 272 and Hong v A & R Brown [1948] 1 KB 515 at 522, viz., that the costs which the plaintiff had been ordered to pay to the defendant who succeeded, and which the plaintiff recovers from the defendant who has failed ""are ordered to be paid by the unsuccessful defendant, on the ground that... those costs have been reasonably and properly incurred by the plaintiff as between him and the [unsuccessful] defendant. In Johnsons Tyne Foundry Pty Ltd v Maffra Corporation, supra, Williams J, at pp 572-3, stated the principle in a similar way, and Starke and Dixon JJ, in giving their reasons for making a Bullock order, both relied on the circumstances that the attitude adopted by the successful defendant had induced the plaintiff to join the other defendant: see at pp 559-60, 566. In my respectful opinion the true position was clearly stated by Blackburn CJ in Steppke v National Capital Development Commission (19 7 8) 21 ACTR 23 at 30-1, when he said that ""there is a condition for the making of a Bullock order, in addition to the question whether the suing of the successful defendant was reasonable, namely that the conduct of the unsuccessful defendant has been such as to make it fair to impose some liability on it for the costs of the successful defendant""."" 

264See also Sved v Council of the Municipality of Woolhara [1998] NSW Conv R 55-842 (at 55-605), Giles J (as he then was), setting out principles that were accepted by this court in Roads and Traffic Authority NSW v Palmer [No 2] [2005] NSWCA 140 at [30] (Spigelman CJ and Handley JA agreeing); Maricic v Dalma Formwork (Aust) Pty Ltd [No 2] [2006] NSWCA 237; (2006) 67 NSWLR 712 at 717-718 per Basten JA (with whom Beazley and Ipp JJA agreed). 

265Mr Neil argued, first, that the late viewing of the CCTV footage (brought about by the need for specialised software) justified a Bullock order. Secondly, he pointed to the fact that the transit officers and RailCorp were represented by the same lawyers. Thirdly, he argued the costs orders in respect of the successful transit officers were unduly onerous to his clients. Finally, he suggested that the overall situation meant that it was reasonable and proper for the brothers to have joined all the transit officers involved, including those who were later successful against his clients in the proceedings. 

266None of these arguments, in my opinion, demonstrate that there was anything in the conduct of RailCorp that would make it just and fair to order them to pay the costs of the brothers' unsuccessful claims against the transit officers. In relation to the CCTV footage, it is obvious enough that, had proper arrangements been made at an earlier point in time, it could have been viewed well before the trial. More importantly, however, after it had been viewed, the brothers maintained their actions against all the transit officers and, indeed, by tendering the CCTV footage and the preliminary Report, indicated their reliance upon that material against all the defendants, not merely Schofield. None of the other arguments advanced by senior counsel pointed to any conduct on the part of RailCorp that could possibly warrant the making of a Bullock order. 

267In my opinion, there is no aspect of the exercise of the trial judge's discretion that would justify the interference by this court on this issue. 

Indemnity costs 

268In relation to the indemnity costs arguments, it is necessary to set out the facts found by the trial judge. These were contained in a separate judgment given by his Honour on 17 November 2008. 

269On 16 October 2007, a formal offer of compromise under Rule 20.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 was sent by fax to the plaintiff's solicitors in respect of Sebastian's claim. This was in the sum of $15,000 plus costs. The offer was expressed to be open until 22 October 2007. On the same day, a formal offer of compromise under the Rules was made in respect of Christian's claim, in the sum of $7,500 plus costs. It too was expressed to remain open until 22 October 2007. It is necessary to note that each plaintiff's case was set down for hearing to commence in the District Court on 22 October 2007. It is also necessary to note that, on 15 October 2007, the day before the formal offers of compromise were served, the plaintiffs' solicitors had rejected an offer of $40,000 inclusive of costs for both plaintiffs and had responded that the cases could not be resolved for anything less than $118,000 inclusive of costs, allocated on the basis of $52,000 inclusive of costs to Sebastian, and $60,000 inclusive of costs for Christian. 

270Although the case was scheduled to commence on 22 October 2007, it was not reached on that day. It was stood over for mention so that a new hearing date could be selected. It was subsequently listed to commence on Monday 4 February 2008. On 4 February 2008, the first day of the trial, a verbal offer of $100,000 plus costs for both matters was made by the plaintiffs' representatives to the defendant's representatives. On the morning of 6 February 2008 (Day 3 of the trial) formal offers of compromise under Rule 20.26 were hand delivered by the defendant's solicitors to the plaintiffs' solicitors in court as follows: 

""(a) Sebastian - $20,000 plus costs. The offer was expressed to be open until 8 February 2008 at 10:00am. 

(b) Christian - $12,500 plus costs. The offer was expressed to be open until 8 February 2008 at 10:00am."" 

271His Honour noted in his final decision that the offer of compromise made to Sebastian on 16 October 2007 was $5,000 more than his award of damages. In the case of Christian, the offer of compromise on 6 February 2008 was $500 more than his award of damages. 

272Although the hearing of the proceedings commenced on 4 February 2008, there were procedural difficulties that led to the plaintiffs' evidence not commencing until the morning of 6 February 2008. The first procedural problem arose out of the fact that the legal representatives for the brothers maintained that they had not been able to examine the CCTV footage of the incident. It appears that the solicitors had also not been able to examine the preliminary inquiry Report into the incident conducted by RailCorp in April 2004. The trial judge found, however, that the lawyers for RailCorp had produced to the court the CCTV footage, and the Report of the inquiry, together with notebook entries of the transit officers, back on 12 February 2007. His Honour found that the material had thus been available to the plaintiffs from 5 March 2007, the day upon which orders were made granting access to the material to the plaintiffs.

2414672,State of New South Wales v Conway [2011] NSWSC 588,"Judgment 

1By Summons filed on 3 May 2011 the plaintiff, the State of NSW, seeks various orders under the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (""the Act""), in respect of the defendant. An Amended Summons was filed on the day of hearing, 14 June 2011. The orders sought in the summons are: 


an order that the defendant be subject to an extended supervision order for a period of 3 years (s 9(1)(a)); 

an order appointing two qualified psychiatrists to conduct separate examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports on the results of those examinations, and a further order directing the defendant to attend those examinations (s 7(4)); 

an order that, for a period of 28 days from 18 June 2011, the defendant be subject to an interim supervision order and comply with certain specified conditions (s 8(1)). 

2The application is opposed by the defendant. 

3The long title of the Act is: 

""An Act to provide for the supervision and detention of serious sex offenders; and for other purposes."" 

4The objects of the Act are spelled out in s 3, as follows: 

""(1) The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community. 
(2) Another object of this Act is to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation."" 

5In pursuit of those objects, the Act empowers this Court, on the application of the State of NSW, and on being satisfied of certain stated criteria (to which I will come) to make an order, in effect, extending, beyond the term of the sentence imposed, supervision of a sex offender (as defined in s 4), who is in custody or is under supervision in consequence of a serious sex offence (as defined in s 5(1)) or an offence of a sexual nature (as defined in s 5(2)): see s 6, s 9. 

6Since, by s 6(2), the State of NSW may not make an application until ""the last 6 months of the offender's current custody or supervision"", and any order must be made during the currency of the offender's sentence (s 6(1)), thus creating some time pressure on both the parties and on the Court, the Act also provides for interim orders (s 8), and for specific pre-trial procedures (s 7). 

7Before coming to the factual issues, it is convenient to refer in more detail to the relevant provisions of the Act. For present purposes, they are: 

"" 5 Definitions ... 
(1) For the purposes of this Act, a serious sex offence means any of the following offences: 

(a) an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 , where: 

(i) in the case of an offence against an adult or a child, the offence is punishable by imprisonment for 7 years or more ..."" 

"" 6 Application for extended supervision order 
(1) The State of New South Wales may apply to the Supreme Court for an extended supervision order against a sex offender who, when the application is made, is in custody or under supervision: 

(a) while serving a sentence of imprisonment: 

(i) for a serious sex offence ... 

(2) An application may not be made until the last 6 months of the offender's current custody or supervision. 

... 

(3) An application must be supported by documentation : 

(a) that addresses each of the matters referred to in section 9(3), and 

(b) that includes a report (prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner) that assesses the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence. 

(4) ..."" 

"" 7 Pre-trial procedures 
(3) A preliminary hearing into the application is to be conducted by the Supreme Court within 28 days after the application is filed in the Supreme Court or within such further time as the Supreme Court may allow. 

(4) If, following the preliminary hearing, it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must make orders: 

(a) appointing: 

(i) 2 qualified psychiatrists, or 

(ii) 2 registered psychologists, or 

(iii) 1 qualified psychiatrist and 1 registered psychologist, or 

(iv) 2 qualified psychiatrists and 2 registered psychologists, 

to conduct separate psychiatric or psychological examinations (as the case requires) of the offender and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations, and 

(b) directing the offender to attend those examinations. 

(5) If, following the preliminary hearing, it is not satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must dismiss the application."" 

"" 8 Interim supervision orders 
(1) If, in proceedings on an application for an extended supervision order, it appears to the Supreme Court: 

(a) that the offender's current custody or supervision will expire before the proceedings are determined, and 

(b) that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, 

the Supreme Court may make an order for the interim supervision of the offender. 

(2) An order under this section commences on the day fixed in the order in that regard (or, if no such day is fixed, as soon as it is made) and expires at the end of such period (not exceeding 28 days from the day on which it commences) as is specified in the order. 

(3) An order under this section may be renewed from time to time, but not so as to provide for the supervision of the offender under such an order for periods totalling more than 3 months."" 

"" 9 Determination of application for extended supervision order 
(1) The Supreme Court may determine an application for an extended supervision order: 

(a) by making an extended supervision order, or 

(b) by dismissing the application. 

(2) An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision. 

(2A) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence. 

(3) In determining whether or not to make an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant: 

(a) the safety of the community, 

(b) the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7(4) ... and the level of the offender's participation in any such examination, 

(c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender's participation in any such assessment, 

(d) the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, 

(d1) any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community, 

(e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender's participation in any such programs, 

(f) the level of the offender's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order, 

(g) the level of the offender's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004, 

(h) the offender's criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history, 

(h1) the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender, 

(i) any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature."" 

I have emphasised those parts of the legislation that are of particular immediate relevance. 

8In the present proceedings, the plaintiff seeks: 


orders under s 7(4), for the appointment of two qualified psychiatrists to examine the defendant and further report on the results of the examinations, and directing the defendant to attend the examinations; 

an order under s 8(1), that the defendant be subject to an interim supervision order from 18 June 2011 to 15 July 2011. 

9It will be seen that s 8 imposes two pre-conditions on the making of an interim supervision order. The first is that it must appear to the Court that the defendant's current custody or supervision will expire before the proceedings are determined; the second is that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making, under s 9, of an extended supervision order. As will appear from what follows, the defendant's term of imprisonment will expire on 18 June, before the proceedings (for a final order, under s 9) can be determined. The first pre-condition is met. 

10The second pre-condition necessarily directs attention to the requirements of s 9, which prescribes the circumstances in which an extended supervision order may be made. That test is relatively undemanding. It assumes acceptance of what is alleged in the documentation provided under s 6(3) to support the application for a final order. 

11In its current form (amended December 2010), s 9(2) provides that an extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that, if not kept under supervision, the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence. Sub-section (2A), presumably enacted in order to avoid doubt about the intention of the legislature (see Tillman v Attorney General for the State of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 327; 178 A Crim R 133) , confirms that the test that the section imposes is not a balance of probabilities test. Sub-section (3) specifies the matters to which the Court must have regard in determining whether or not to make an order. For present purposes, the relevant sub-paragraphs are sub-ss (3)(a) (the safety of the community) and (3)(h) (the offender's criminal history). 

The application 

12In accordance with s 6(3), the application was supported by a number of affidavits, notably three affirmed by Ms Emma Bayley, a solicitor having the carriage of the application; one affirmed by Ms Theresa Britton, a registered psychologist (annexing an extensive psychological report) and others which it is not necessary here to mention. 

13Exhibited to Ms Bayley's affidavit of 10 May 2011 was a considerable volume of documentary material, contained in two large folders (Ex A), which had been produced by various entities in response to an order in writing served pursuant to s 25 of the Act. That material included a significant number of reports concerning assessments made of the defendant, and information gathered from and about him. Of its nature, much of which is contained therein is of a hearing nature. If it were not otherwise admissible, that material is made admissible by s 25(3). 

14I am satisfied that the material contained in Ex A satisfies the requirements of s 6(3). 

The relevant facts and circumstances 

15On 19 September 2007 the defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years, commencing on 19 June 2007, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. The non-parole period expired on 18 September 2009. The total sentence will expire on 18 June 2011. The first of the s 8 pre-conditions is therefore met. The defendant was in fact released to parole on 27 April 2011. 

16It is not in issue that the defendant is, within the meaning of the definition in s 4, a sex offender, who has been convicted of a serious sex offence, as defined in s 5(1). That is because, on 19 September 2007 he was convicted (following his plea of guilty) of a single count of sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10 years, an offence against s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900, which appears in Div 10 of Pt 3 of the Crimes Act , and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years (see s 5). 

17The defendant was born in November 1986; the offence was committed on 5 March 2007, when he was 20 years of age. The victim was 5 years of age, and was a relative of the defendant. 

18The defendant has not been convicted of any other offences. He is currently housed in accommodation in Woolgoolga provided by an entity known as the Community Justice Program. 

19The documentation provided by the plaintiff pursuant to s 6(3) is extensive and comprehensive. It includes a report of a registered psychologist containing the assessment required under s 6(3)(b), and addresses the matters specified in s 9(3). The material indicates that, during his period of incarceration, the defendant has been the subject of quite intense assessment and scrutiny. There are records indicating that he has admitted that, on a number of occasions over the years, he has engaged in conduct that, subject to questions of mens rea , would constitute sex offences. The psychologist's report asserts that the defendant has ""self reported"" to numerous people a life-long sexual attraction to underage children, and a general ""hyper-sexuality"". The report assesses the risk of sexual recidivism as high (para 90). The defendant is assessed as having ""borderline intellectual ability"" with ""paedophilic urges"". 

20Despite the bulk of material presented, and the defendant's opposition to the order sought, the disputed issues were very limited. 

21On behalf of the defendant it was argued that, in considering the matters itemised in s 9(3) as relevant to the determination whether to make an order ought be made or not, the consideration specified in s 9(3)(h) (the offender's criminal history) ought not to include any offences other than those that resulted in conviction or finding of guilt. I do not accept this construction. If it were correct, the words ""criminal history"", which are the principal subject of the sub-paragraph, would add nothing to that which appears in parentheses; and nor would the words ""and any pattern of offending behaviour"" that follow the parentheses. 

22In my opinion, it is appropriate to take into account those instances of sexual misconduct to which the defendant has admitted. Having regard, particularly, to the defendant's intellectual disability, it was submitted that an issue arises whether those instances could properly be labelled part of his ""criminal history"". This was because it could not be assumed that the necessary mens rea accompanied the actions said to constitute the offences. Some of the instances appear to have occurred before the defendant acquired the age of criminal capacity (10 years), and others during the period of doli incapax , in which it is necessary for the prosecution to establish a capacity in the alleged offender to understand the nature of the conduct in question. 

23I accept that a question arises, and may well arise on a final hearing, concerning the extent to which some of the conduct referred to may be taken into account. However, as was conceded on behalf of the defendant, even if it cannot be shown that the defendant could have been convicted of offences in respect of those episodes of misconduct, and that they therefore may not be taken into account as ""criminal history"", that he engaged in the conduct is clearly relevant to sub-para (i), and, I would add, to sub-para (a). In my opinion, the whole of the conduct that is attributed to the defendant is relevant to the present consideration. 

24The documentation provided amply demonstrates, for the purposes of s 8(1)(b), that the matters alleged would, if proved, justify the making of an interim supervision order, and I propose to make such an order. 

25The second issue in dispute concerned the construction of s 9(2). This section is of recent origin, having been inserted into the Act with effect from 7 December 2010, replacing a formulation which included the words: 

""... is likely to commit a further serious sex offence."" 

26Counsel were able to provide only two instances on which the section has previously been considered by this Court: State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 118 (R A Hulme J); State of New South Wales v Richard John Darrego [2011] NSWSC 360 (McCallum J). R A Hulme J considered that the test in s 9(2) would be satisfied: 

""... if there is a risk that the person will commit a serious sex offence which is present to a sufficient degree so that the safety and protection of the community cannot be ensured unless an order is made ."" (emphasis added) 

27In reaching this view, R A Hulme J drew on s 3 of the Act, stating the objects of the Act. 

28In Darrego , McCallum J took a different view, adopting, from another sphere of law, the language of medical negligence, and importing the notion of ""material risk"". 

29I note that neither purported to express a final view. 

30While it is not necessary to express a final view on the issue, I state a preference for the approach taken by R A Hulme J. This is, in part, because it draws closely upon the objects and the language of the Act itself, and not upon a different area of legal discourse. Whichever is the better interpretation, for the purposes of an interim supervision order, the test is satisfied. I will therefore make an interim supervision order under s 8(1). 

31In anticipation of that result, the plaintiff proposed, pursuant to s 6(4), a series of conditions to be imposed for which provision is made by s 11. After negotiation, only one of these was opposed. This was an order requiring that the defendant reside in such accommodation as is approved in advance by the Departmental Supervising Officer. 

32As mentioned above, the defendant is currently housed in a facility, which is reasonably secure, in Woolgoolga. He, I was advised, would wish to live with his mother in a different part of NSW. It is not clear that that accommodation is available to him; moreover, it is the location in which he committed the offence of which he was convicted, and where, it appears, he would be likely to be in contact with the victim of the offence, and other children. 

33In the circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the relatively limited operation of an interim supervision order, I am satisfied that the condition proposed is, as an interim measure at least, an appropriate one. I will include it in the conditions I make. 

34I make the orders in accordance with the Short Minutes proposed by the plaintiff, attached hereto.

2414838,R v Hawi & ors (No 12) [2011] NSWSC 1658,"Judgment 

1HIS HONOUR: The Crown proposes to tender CCTV footage recorded from various security cameras that were in place at Melbourne Airport and at the T3 Qantas Sydney domestic terminal on 22 March 2009. It also proposes to tender a PowerPoint compilation of some of that footage, together with some other footage that it does not propose to separately tender. There was argument yesterday about the admissibility of the PowerPoint compilation. Late yesterday I indicated my view that it was admissible. These are my reasons. 

2It has been known for at least a year that this PowerPoint compilation was something that the prosecution had available. As best I can gather, it has been known for at least two or three months that the Crown proposed to tender this compilation in the trial. 

3No one, up until yesterday, had indicated any objection to the concept of the compilation being tendered. Objections have been confined to certain discrete aspects of it. In particular, objections have been indicated to certain labelling within the compilation, such as text ascriptions to some of the figures depicted where it was not conceded that the figure was a certain person. I understand that the Crown has accommodated such foreshadowed objections by deleting such ascriptions. 

4The Crown Prosecutor informed me that she played this PowerPoint compilation during her opening address at the committal hearing 12 months ago. She said that it had subsequently been ""tweaked"" so as to remove certain descriptions and identifications, but, in substance, the footage is, as I understand it, essentially the same. That ""tweaking"" has continued subsequent to the Crown Prosecutor having played it to the jury during the course of her opening address on 25 May 2011. 

5Last Thursday, 30 June 2011, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that it had been proposed to tender the CCTV footage and the PowerPoint compilation following the completion of the eyewitness evidence and that it was anticipated that this would occur on Wednesday 6 July 2011. No objection was indicated on behalf of any of the accused at that point as to the idea of such a compilation becoming part of the evidence. 

6Yesterday morning, just after the morning adjournment, there was a further discussion about the proposed tender of the compilation which followed a discussion that had taken place the day before. The Crown Prosecutor confirmed that she had accommodated the objections to certain aspects of it that had been communicated to her by Mr Stratton SC for the accused Menzies, and Mr Gordon, counsel for the accused Kisacanin. Mr Gordon at that point rose to voice a concern that counsel should have the opportunity to view the material that was intended to go to the jury before it went to the jury. That was, of course, quite a reasonable concern to raise. 

7Following some discussion which seemed to have resolved the question of counsel having the opportunity to view the material, Mr Gordon then, completely out of the blue it must be said, raised an objection to the admissibility of the compilation itself. He outlined the nature of the objection. The primary evidence was the footage from the CCTV cameras themselves. The PowerPoint compilation, he submitted, ""is simply a large section of the prosecution opening speech to the jury and is not the evidence at all"" (T1890.10). 

8Mr Gordon submitted that there was a danger of the jury having something which represented the Crown case and ""which omit(s) such features such as timings, when the primary evidence is the CCTV footage. That is what the jury should concentrate on with all its good and bad points, rather than the polished version presented by the Crown"" (T1890.15). Mr Gordon then apologised for raising the matter at such a late stage, although he also indicated that he had been considering it ""right from the word go"" (T1890.28). The issue was then stood down for further consideration at 4pm. 

9When the issue was revisited later in the day, the Crown Prosecutor confirmed that the PowerPoint material was a compilation in chronological order that was intended to save the jury time in coming to grips with a considerable body of material from individual surveillance cameras and to make the evidence more comprehensible. No counsel had suggested to the Crown that the compilation was incomplete. No counsel had asked that any material not included in it be included. Putting it in my terms, no counsel had suggested to the Crown, or previously to me, that the compilation was unfair in that it supported the Crown case by omitting material that might support the case for any of the accused. 

10I raised with Mr Gordon why the objection was being taken at such a late stage when he had been on notice of the proposed tender of the compilation for quite some time. That aspect may be put to one side because it really does not go to the gravamen of the issue. However, I remain of the view that it is of concern that counsel could not attend to a determination of whether there was an objection to the admissibility of the evidence when, up until yesterday, all that had been indicated was an objection to discrete portions of it which, as I have indicated, the Crown has accommodated. 

11The objection was on these bases: the compilation duplicates material that would otherwise be before the jury; the compilation represented an opening address to the jury being placed into evidence; it was not evidence in itself but rather was ""a tool for the Crown's speech"" (T1952.46); the compilation was ""incomplete"" and ""misleading"" ; the defence had not previously been served with a copy of the compilation that was proposed to be tendered; and, the material presents ""a manicured version of the CCTV footage the Crown is also to tender put together in a way which suits the Crown case and amounts therefore to a presentation of the Crown case"" (T1955.18). 

12I do not, with respect, accept the validity of any of the bases of the objection. 

13Pre-trial disclosure orders pursuant to s 141 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 were made in this matter on 11 March 2011. Such orders imposed an obligation upon the legal representatives of the accused to disclose, inter alia, whether the accused person proposed to dispute the admissibility of any of the proposed evidence disclosed by the prosecutor, and the basis of the objection: s 143(d). That disclosure obligation was ongoing: s 147. The Crown has complied with its obligation to disclose the proposal to tender the PowerPoint compilation. No one prior to yesterday had indicated any objection to it. There are sanctions for a failure to comply with the disclosure obligations in Chapter 3, Part 3, Division 3 of the Act. However, I did not determine the objection by reference to those provisions. 

14The interests of the administration of justice involves concepts of fairness. Fairness applies as much to the Crown as it does to the accused. Mr Gordon's objection at such a late stage carried with it the potential for unfairness to the orderly presentation of the Crown case. But, again, I did not determine the objection upon that basis. 

15In relation to the various bases put forward by Mr Gordon for objecting to the admissibility of the compilation, my response is simply to indicate that I accept the Crown submission that there is a worthwhile purpose to be served by the jury being provided with a chronological compilation of footage from the CCTV cameras that will hasten and aid their comprehension of the evidence. It is appropriate that the jury also have the CCTV footage itself. However, restricting the jury to the latter would involve the jury in a convoluted and time consuming task in trying to piece it all together in a logical order. 

16A particular matter I take into account is that whilst there were submissions made by Mr Gordon that the compilation was "" misleading "" and "" incomplete "", there was no suggestion as to what should be added to it that would render it more accurate, fair and complete. There was no suggestion by counsel for each of the other accused that there was anything about the compilation that was misleading or incomplete. 

17Mr Grant, junior counsel for the accused Hawi, indicated that he would like some time to discuss with his leader whether there was any objection to the tender of the compilation. In relation to this, two things are to be noted. There has been no indication, per s 143(d) of the Criminal Procedure Act and the ongoing disclosure obligation in s 147 that there was any objection to the admissibility of evidence that has been disclosed by the Crown for a very long time. Secondly, Mr Dunn, of Queen's Counsel, who was not present in court yesterday but who was present last Thursday, 30 June 2011 when the Crown indicated the proposed tender of the material the following Wednesday, that is today, has had ample opportunity to indicate an objection. I felt I was safe to assume that leading counsel for Mr Hawi would have acted responsibly and, as he has not previously indicated any concern, there is in reality no concern on behalf of his client as to the tender of the compilation. 

18For those reasons I was of the view that the PowerPoint compilation of the CCTV footage was admissible.

		09 February 2012",2011-07-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2414897,SJ v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 160,"Judgment  1BATHURST CJ : I will invite Buddin J to give the first judgment.  BUDDIN J  Introduction  2The applicant, who was a juvenile at the time of the offence, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court by Judge English.  It followed his plea of guilty to an offence of robbery committed on 26 July 2008 in circumstances of aggravation, namely that the victim was wounded.  The offence attracts a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment.  On 4 February 2010 the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years and 2 months to date from 10 December 2009 with a head sentence of 5 years 11 months and 12 days.  His non-parole period is thus due to expire on 9 February 2013.   The sentence was backdated to the date upon which the applicant was remanded in custody, which was at the end of the sentencing hearing.  The sentence was structured in such a fashion as to give effect to a finding of ""special circumstances"".  The sentencing judge made an order, pursuant to s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 that the applicant, who was 17 at the time of the offence, was to serve his sentence in a juvenile detention centre until he reached the age of 21.  The sentence proceedings  3Although there was agreement about some aspects of the Crown case, other matters remained in dispute.  That dispute was resolved by the sentencing judge after her Honour heard evidence from two witnesses called by the Crown and from the applicant.  4A short statement of facts was tendered in order to provide the sentencing judge with a framework within which to determine the facts that were in issue.  That statement revealed that the victim of the offence (a 14 year old boy) and his 11 year old brother were returning home at about 10 pm on the night in question after having attended an NRL match at Penrith.  They were standing on a street corner with a friend when a blue Commodore vehicle approached them.  In the vehicle were the applicant and four other young persons, JT, ST, PT and JF.  As the vehicle approached the victim's group, the victim's friend rode off on his pushbike.  The vehicle then stopped next to where the victim and his brother were standing.  The applicant and JT got out of the car, approached the victim and demanded his money.  When the victim said that he did not have any, they repeatedly punched and kicked him.  They also stomped on his head.    During the attack the victim curled up in an unsuccessful attempt to protect himself.  In due course he lost consciousness.  As the result of the attack, the victim sustained a deep 10 cm wound to the right side of his head.  As well as sustaining swelling to his entire face, he also received other severe lacerations.  Photographs of the injuries were tendered at the hearing.  5After stealing the victim's running shoes, wallet and wristwatch as he lay unconscious on the ground, the applicant and JT then returned to the vehicle which then left the scene.  Police and ambulance officers attended and conveyed the victim to Nepean Hospital for urgent medical attention.  6Police obtained the registration number of the vehicle and were able to ascertain that it was registered to JF's mother.  Enquiries led them to speak to ST, on both 5 and 19 August 2008, and to PT on 19 August 2008.  As a result of information obtained during those interviews, police made endeavours to locate the applicant.  On 27 August 2008 the applicant attended Mt Druitt Police Station where he was placed under arrest.  During the course of an ERISP interview, he denied having played any part in the robbery.  He admitted to being an associate of other persons involved in it, but was unable to explain why they would ""fabricate his involvement"" in it.  He also admitted that he and the persons who were involved in the offence were members of a gang called 'FBI' (which is an acronym for full blooded Islanders).  Police observed that during the interview the applicant had not shown any remorse or concern for his victim.  However after the interview, one of the officers noticed that the applicant had become upset.  The applicant then admitted to police that he had, in fact, been there on the night in question but maintained that he had intervened and ""pulled [JT] off"".  7ST pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to the robbery in which the applicant was involved and was sentenced by Judge Syme on 7 September 2009 to a control order for a period of 4 months, which was suspended.  His culpability arose from his having been the driver of the Commodore vehicle.  On 9 September 2009 JT was sentenced by Judge Syme for the same offence of which the applicant was convicted.  He received a non-parole period of 3 years and 2 months with an overall sentence of 6 years imprisonment.  An appeal against that sentence was dismissed by a differently constituted bench of this Court on 10 June 2011:  see JT v R [2011] NSWCCA 128.  It is to be observed that no issue of parity is raised on this application in respect of the sentence that was imposed on JT.  8As I have said, the applicant disputed various aspects of the Crown case.  The statement of facts to which I referred earlier was based on what PT and ST had told police.  In his statement to police, PT, who was 16 at the time, said that he was asked to join 'FBI' by a person he referred to as 'King C' (whom he knew to be the applicant).  After describing the incident in which the applicant and JT were involved, PT maintained that he had got out of the car and had dragged JT off the victim.  He said that he had yelled both at him and the applicant to get back in the car.  ST, who was 15 at the time, provided a description of events which was to a broadly similar effect, including the fact that PT had sought to restrain both JT and the applicant.  However, it was not until his second interview that he referred to the involvement of the applicant in the offence.  Both PT and ST were required for cross-examination by the applicant's then legal representative.  When giving evidence, each sought to distance himself from what he had originally told police.  Each gave evidence that he had been intoxicated at the time of speaking with police and that he could not recall what he had told them or indeed, any of the details of the incident.  Unsurprisingly, the sentencing judge rejected those explanations as to why they had resiled from their original statements.  It is unnecessary, for present purposes, to descend to any further analysis of that aspect of the matter.  Suffice it to say that the explanations which were proffered were completely implausible.  That is particularly so in the case of ST who was accompanied, at the time of speaking to police, by either a parent or a legal guardian.  9The applicant also gave evidence at the sentence hearing.  He claimed to have punched the victim on only one occasion, after which he said that he had ""moved away"".  He also denied having kicked the victim or having taken his property.  He nominated PT as the person who had initially pursued the victim when the latter had attempted to get away.  He did concede however that he had called out for ST to stop the car so that he could ""beat up the victim"".  He said that he had decided ""to roll"" someone about half an hour before they had come upon the victim.  He explained that expression to mean that he intended to ""beat him up and take his stuff"".  He gave evidence that, since he had been seeing his girlfriend, his associates had been teasing him that he had been ""under the thumb"".  His motivation for having committed the offence, he said, was his desire ""to prove to the boys I hadn't changed"" and that he was just as tough as he had always been.  The sentencing judge found as a fact that the versions provided to the police by PT and ST were an accurate reflection of what had occurred.  10In relation to the applicant's version of events, her Honour found that ""this was a premeditated assault upon an innocent young boy to prove he was still 'King C'.  It was instigated by him, it was his blow to the victim's jaw which fell (sic) the victim.  Contrary to his evidence I find he did kick the victim as he lay on the ground and it was [PT] who stopped the assault contrary to what this offender would have this court believe.""  There is no challenge in this Court to her Honour's findings concerning the factual basis upon which the applicant stood to be sentenced.  11Her Honour then addressed the subjective aspects of the applicant's case.  The applicant is the youngest of 9 children.  He was born in New Zealand but moved to Australia with his family in April 2007.  His formative years were unremarkable other than for the fact that, sadly, an older brother had committed suicide.  The applicant began consuming alcohol at the age of 16.  Although his attendance at school was at times less than satisfactory, there was evidence that, in the period whilst he was on bail, he had been attending a youth services centre in an endeavour to further his studies.  The pastor of the local church which he had attended provided the applicant with a letter of support.  12Her Honour allowed the applicant a discount of 15% on account of his plea of guilty which was entered upon his arraignment in the District Court.  She also acknowledged that he came before the court as a person without any prior convictions.  13Her Honour then had regard to the sentence which had been imposed upon JT.  But for the fact that her Honour found that the applicant had instigated the attack upon the victim, she otherwise saw no reason to distinguish their roles in the commission of the offence.  Her Honour however recognised that, unlike the applicant, JT had a criminal record and that he had been on conditional liberty at the time of the offence.  On the other hand, JT's plea of guilty which was entered at an early stage had attracted a discount of 25%, and there were a number of other matters which served to moderate his sentence, that did not arise in the applicant's case.  14The applicant relied upon the following grounds of appeal:  1 Her Honour erred by finding that there was a total lack of remorse and contrition shown by the offender.  2 Her Honour erred in failing to have regard to the principles in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and the principles governing the sentencing of juvenile offenders.  3 Her Honour erred in imposing a sentence that was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances.  Ground 1  15In order to consider this ground, it is necessary to refer to the evidence which was before the sentencing judge in relation to the issue of remorse.  In a Juvenile Justice Background report dated 25 November 2009 under a heading entitled ""Victim Empathy"", the author observed that:  [SJ] expressed remorse for his actions when asked to reflect on his involvement in the offence.  He was able to recognise that the victim would have experienced "" fear and pain "", and that he would have been "" frightened and scared"" .  [SJ] also acknowledged that the victim may continue to experience these feelings and therefore may be "" scarred for life"" .  Whilst there is obviously room for further development of the concept of victim empathy, [SJ's] ability and willingness to engage in the initial steps of this process is encouraging.  16During the sentence hearing the following exchange occurred whilst the applicant was giving evidence:  Q Tell her Honour how you feel about his incident?  A I really regret this incident.  HER HONOUR  Q Why?  Because of the trouble you're now in or because of what you did to the victim?  A Because of I what did to the victim and the state he was left in.  17In an updated Juvenile Justice Report dated 3 February 2010 the following appears:  [SJ] informed this author that he has had a lot of time to think about his actions relating to this offence and views the offence as a 'waste of time' and 'not worth being in custody' for.  From telephone interviews with the young person, it appears that the offence was financially motivated.  [SJ] has been able to express that if it was his brother who was the victim of such an offence, he would be angry and he can only imagine how the victim's parents would feel.  [SJ] further went on to say that he thought the victim would be 'scarred for life' and that he would be unlikely to be out alone by himself in the future.  18In her remarks on sentence, her Honour said that the applicant ""comes before this court as a young person facing a very serious criminal charge who has not shown one iota of remorse or contrition despite what others may say"". Her Honour also said:  In the opinion of the Juvenile Justice Officer the offender retains a perception or need to protect his social status and street reputation.  The offender had spoken of an involvement in boxing up until the age of fourteen, he also spoke of a perception that others wished to fight him because of his size.  When interviewed he spoke of some understanding of the fear and pain his victim would have felt and that his victim might be scarred for life.  The Juvenile Justice Officer was of the view that there was room for further development of the concept of victim empathy.  Certainly by the time he gave evidence he had lost any such victim empathy.  He was not the respectful engaged personality described by Juvenile Justice in court but rather an arrogant and belligerent young man who seemed all too pleased with himself and prepared to boast about his conquest as he saw it.  19A little later, her Honour observed:  In the most recent Juvenile Justice report, which was made available for this sentence today, the officer as a consequence of speaking with the offender was of the opinion that the offence was ""financially motivated"".  If his evidence on oath is to be accepted nothing could be further from the truth.  From that report it is clear he still has simply no understanding of the seriousness of the offence he has committed or the condemnation in which he is held by this court and no doubt the community at large.  It is simply extraordinary that he describes his offending behaviour as ""a waste of time"" and ""not worth being in custody"".  That shows a complete lack of incite [sic] on his part and a total lack of genuine remorse or contrition.  It demonstrates someone who considers being placed into custody an inconvenience rather than a punishment for the crime committed, a very very serious crime. ...  I am not persuaded that the offender is truly remorseful and contrite despite the opinion of the Juvenile Justice Officer.  As I have said his demeanour and behaviour in court was clearly to the contrary.  The contents of his conversation to the Juvenile Justice Officer in more recent times confirms the view I have already formed.  20It was submitted that those findings were not open to her Honour in light of the material that had been placed before her at the sentence hearing.  It was submitted that the sentencing judge had allowed her view,  that PT and ST had resiled from their original statements in an attempt to benefit the applicant, to infect her judgment when she was considering the issue of the applicant's remorse.  21The starting point for a consideration of this ground is s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which lists as a mitigating factor:  the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:  (i)  the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and  (ii) the offender has acknowledge any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both)  22The onus of establishing remorse as a mitigating factor rests with the applicant on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270.  23As the assessment of whether or not the applicant had satisfied the statutory requirement involved a exercise of judicial discretion, the applicant must demonstrate error of the kind identified in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 in order to succeed on this ground: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85, per Spigelman CJ [at para 11].  In my view, the applicant has failed in that endeavour.  24It is true, as counsel for the applicant pointed out, that there were a number of references during the course of the proceedings to the reluctance of the two witnesses to give evidence.  There were also several robust comments passed by her Honour which raised the spectre that the witnesses had been intimidated.  Nevertheless, her Honour did not, in terms, make an actual finding that the applicant had been responsible for any such intimidation as there may have been.  In any event, the sentencing judge's conclusion was not solely based, as I read her Honour's remarks, upon the circumstances in which the two witnesses sought to resile from what they had originally told police.  25Indeed, there were a number of features of the case that enabled her Honour to come to the conclusion which she reached.   First, there was the fact that the applicant had lied in his initial interview to police.  Indeed, a reading of the interview reveals that he had demonstrated a degree of callousness towards the victim at that time.  Secondly, the evidence which he gave at the sentence hearing was designed to minimise the extent of his involvement in the offence.  Moreover, by then, over a year had passed since the time of the offence and accordingly, the applicant had had plenty of time within which to reflect upon the incident.  There was nothing to suggest, from the tenor of his evidence, that he had ""accepted responsibility for his actions"" in any meaningful sense.  Thirdly, her Honour had the advantage of observing the applicant both whilst he was in the dock and whilst he was giving his evidence.  It is apparent from her Honour's remarks, to which I referred earlier, that he created a less than favourable impression.  In the circumstances, her Honour was perfectly entitled to discard the applicant's expression of regret in the witness box.  Indeed, in Alvares v R [2011] NSWCCA 33 I said, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court:  ...a sentencing judge is not bound to accept assertions by an offender that he is remorseful, even when that assertion is made in the witness box: R v Stafrace ( 1997) 96 A Crim R 452.  Nor will what Simpson J described, in Pham v R [2010] NSWCCA 208 [at para 33], as ""the often ritual incantation of remorse and contrition"" be automatically accepted by a sentencing judge . [at para 65]  26Fourthly, the only other material upon this issue was what was contained in the Juvenile Justice reports.  The author of those reports was at something of a disadvantage in evaluating the genuineness of the applicant's expression of remorse because it was not possible to provide her with a copy of the facts surrounding the offence because they were in dispute.  In any event, there is a consistent line of authority concerning the caution which should be exercised by a court in evaluating material of that kind.  See Alvares (supra) at paras 49-52.  27Counsel for the applicant also referred to her Honour's remarks concerning the contents of the updated Juvenile Justice report, and in particular, to the applicant's observations that he viewed his offence as being a ""waste of time"" and ""not worth being in custody for.""  It was submitted that those comments represented ""a genuine, if inarticulate and immature, expression of remorse by the applicant.""  It was also submitted that her Honour had ""misconstrued"" the remarks attributed to the applicant and had, accordingly, fallen into error.  It should be observed that when the updated report was tendered, her Honour had specifically invited the parties to address upon any aspect of the report that they saw fit to raise.  Neither party availed themselves of that opportunity.  28I am prepared to accept that the applicant's remarks, when considered in isolation, may be somewhat ambiguous and thus open to different interpretations.  Nevertheless, when regard is had to the totality of the evidence upon this issue, I am not persuaded that error has been demonstrated with the consequence that this ground of appeal should be rejected.  Ground 2  29The first proposition upon which the applicant relied in support of this Ground, was that her Honour erred in not referring, either expressly or impliedly, to s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 which is in the following terms:  A person or body that has functions under this Act is to exercise those functions having regard to the following principles:  (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them,  (b  that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance,  (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption,  (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home,  (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind,  (f) that it is desirable that children who commit offences be assisted with their reintegration into the community so as to sustain family and community ties,  (g) that it is desirable that children who commit offences accept responsibility for their actions and, wherever possible, make reparation for their actions,  (h) that, subject to the other principles described above, consideration should be given to the effect of any crime on the victim.  30It was also submitted that her Honour had fallen into error in failing to refer to authorities such as KT v R (2008) 182 A Crim R 571 and BP v R (2010) 201 A Crim R 379.  Reliance was placed upon the observations of Rothman J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, in R v LNT [2005] NSWCCA 307:  In the sentencing of a particular offender, it is unnecessary for a sentencing judge to set out all of the cases which have dealt with the principles. Further, it is unnecessary for the sentencing judge to deal at length with the balancing exercise dictated by the principle or whether, because of the findings of fact, the offender should be treated as an adult in all respects. However, the absence of any remark that the offender is being treated, if it be the case, in all respects, as an adult, is, to say the least, problematic. Further, if the references to age of the applicant by the sentencing judge were intended to be the consideration of the applicability of the principles relating to child offenders, one would expect some mention of the process.  The absence of any reference to the principles associated with the sentencing of young offenders in the remarks on sentence is sought to be countered by the Crown submission that the principles were put to his Honour by counsel for the applicant below and, quite separately, that his Honour did refer to the age of the applicant. The mere fact that his Honour was addressed on the principles associated with the sentencing of young offenders, but did not refer to them or to the fact that he had taken them into account, does not, of itself, suggest that his Honour did take account of such principles. ...  An analysis of the remarks on sentence does not indicate any consideration by his Honour of the principles associated with sentencing minors or juvenile offenders, or whether such principles ought, or ought not, be applied. [at paras 34, 35 and 37]  31It may be accepted at once that her Honour did not refer, in terms, to the important principles enunciated in s6 of the Act.  It would have been preferable had her Honour done so.    However, I am not persuaded that her Honour overlooked or, in some other fashion, ignored the sentencing principles which govern the sentencing of young offenders.  Indeed, her Honour referred to the applicant as ""the young person"".  Moreover, she determined that he would be detained in a juvenile detention centre until he turned 21.  Her Honour also observed that:  [h]is prospects for rehabilitation will largely depend upon him developing insight into his offending behaviour and demonstrate a willingness to continue with his education, obtain employment and choose better friends...  He is of course still relatively young and rehabilitation remains of paramount consideration.  He is being dealt with at law due to the serious nature of the crime committed by him. ... Street violence is a significant problem.  It is often committed by young men seeking to earn a reputation and it will not be tolerated whatever the motivation might be. General deterrence still looms large despite the age of the offender.  32In my view, those observations provide a very strong indication that her Honour was well aware of the relevant principles that are to be applied when sentencing a young offender for an offence involving serious violence.  Moreover, her Honour's remarks demonstrate that the circumstances of the present case are somewhat removed from those which prevailed in LNT (supra).  33It was also submitted ""that her Honour's finding that the offence was instigated by the applicant to prove his worth to his mates bespeaks a lack of adult emotional maturity and impulse control on the part of the applicant which her Honour failed to address"".  34A similar submission was addressed by this court in JT (supra).  Hoeben J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, observed:  I am not persuaded that this is the sort of offence which indicates impulsivity and immaturity on the part of the applicant so that the need for rehabilitation should be given paramount consideration. Rather, this is the very sort of offence that McClellan CJ at CL had in mind when qualifying his initial statement of principle in paras [24] and [25] of KT v Regina .  This is the sort of case where general deterrence and retribution cannot be ignored. The bashing of a 14 year old child into insensibility during the course of a prolonged attack by two significantly older youths is very much the sort of crime of violence and considerable gravity which his Honour had in mind. ...  Similar observations were made by Dunford J in R v MA [2004] NSWCCA 92 where his Honour said:  ""28 ... There comes a point at which the seriousness of the crime committed by a young offender, particularly if a crime of violence, is so great that the special attention normally given to rehabilitation in the case of young offenders must give way, and greater emphasis given to punishment and deterrence. The relevant principle was summarised in the joint judgment of this Court in R v AEM Snr and Ors [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [97] - [98] as follows:  ""It is well accepted that in the case of youth, general deterrence and public denunciation usually play a subordinate role to the need to have regard to individual treatment aimed at rehabilitation.... However, important as that principle is, it cannot defeat the primary purpose of punishment nor, in circumstances where young offenders conduct themselves in a way which an adult does, can it stand in the way of the need to protect society.""""  In R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128, Lee CJ at CL said at p 135:  ""It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison unless that course is necessary. But the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal courts' function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes.""   [at paras 34-7]  35That reasoning, in my view, is equally apposite to the present case even allowing for the fact, as his Honour noted, that JT had an extensive criminal history.  36I would reject this Ground of Appeal.  Ground 3  37It appeared to be common ground that her Honour's starting point, before allowing the applicant a discount fo 15% for his plea of guilty, was a sentence of 7 years imprisonment.  In advancing the submission that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, counsel for the applicant relied upon this Court's decision in MW v R [2010] NSWCCA 324, a case in which a young offender, aged 17 years and 8 months, had committed an offence of aggravated robbery with wounding.  Simpson J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, observed that:  As I have mentioned above, the sentence ultimately imposed incorporated a reduction of 35 per cent in recognition of the plea of guilty and assistance to authorities.  That translates to a starting point, therefore, of 5 years with a non-parole period of about 2 years and 8 months.  For an older offender, with a lengthier criminal record, that sentence would be well within the range.  I have come to the view that, having regard to the applicant's youth, his relatively benign criminal record, and his personal circumstances, the sentence was manifeslty excessive.  [at para 56-7]  38In written submissions, counsel for the applicant contended that:  It is submitted that the objective criminality of the offending behaviour in that case is comparable with this matter.  Given that the age and antecedents of the applicant entitle him to more favourable consideration than the successful applicant in that matter we submit that despite the differences in the cases and the limitations on how useful comparison with any individual case may be that this decision supports the submission that the applicant's sentence is manifestly excessive.  39I am not persuaded that the submission should be accepted.  First, Simpson J was not purporting to establish a range for all offences that fall within the category of aggravated robbery with wounding.  Her Honour's remarks were confined to the facts of that particular case which were quite different to the present case.    Secondly, the applicant's contention falls to be considered in the light of a consistent line of authority to the effect that ""care must be taken...in using what has been done in other cases"".  See Hili and Jones v R (2010) 272 ALR 465 [at para 53]; R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368.  40This was, on any view, a most serious offence of its kind.  It was committed late at night upon a vulnerable young victim in the presence of his 11 year old brother, by a very powerfully built young man who, at the time, was in the company of another young offender.  Notwithstanding the applicant's youth, his lack of prior convictions and his plea of guilty, I am not persuaded that this ground of appeal should be upheld.  41I propose that the time within which to seek leave to appeal should be extended, that leave should be granted but that the appeal should be dismissed.  42BATHURST CJ : I agree with the orders proposed by Buddin J and with his reasons.  43HARRISON J : I also agree.  44BATHURST CJ : The orders of the court accordingly will be:  1 Extend the time for seeking leave to appeal up to and including 6 May 2011.  2 Grant leave to appeal.  3 Dismiss the appeal.  **********

2415194,Martin v R [2011] NSWCCA 188,"Judgment  1McCLELLAN CJ at CL :  I agree with Fullerton J.  2SIMPSON J :  I agree with Fullerton J.  3FULLERTON J :  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court on 22 April 2010 after pleading guilty to breaking and entering the home of his former partner on 28 April 2009 and causing her actual bodily harm by kicking her and causing severe bruising to her legs.  The photographs tendered on sentence attest to the severity of her injuries.  4The offence is laid contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.  It carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and attracts a standard non-parole period of 5 years.  After allowing a 15 per cent discount for the plea of guilty the sentencing judge imposed a term of imprisonment of 6 years which resulted in a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 3 years after a finding of special circumstances.  5In the same sentencing hearing but by reference to a separate indictment her Honour sentenced the applicant for an additional breach of s 112(2) of the Crimes Act , but on this occasion by his breaking and entering commercial premises where a larceny was committed in company.  The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years comprised of a non-parole period of 2 years for that offence.  A concurrent fixed term of 12 months was also imposed for a take and drive offence.  There is no challenge to either sentence.  6The sentence under challenge was however partially accumulated on that effective sentence.  In the result, the applicant will serve a period of 2 years in custody solely referable to the breach of s 112(2) which was committed by his breaking and entering a private dwelling and which involved the infliction of violence on his former partner.  7The applicant identified three errors in the sentence her Honour imposed for that offence.  The first is constituted by her failure to assess objective seriousness relative to mid range offending in accordance with R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575 and the second her failure to record her reason for departing from the standard non-parole period as required by s 54B(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  The third error concerns her finding that the objective seriousness of the offending was aggravated by being committed while the applicant was on bail for the earlier offences, contrary to R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 163 A Crim R 381.  8The Crown submitted, and the applicant accepted, that the failure to provide reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period did not of itself invalidate the sentence.  The Crown conceded that the errors identified in the remaining grounds of appeal were established but invoked s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in support of the ultimate submission that despite error the appeal should be dismissed since no lesser sentence than the effective 2 years imprisonment her Honour imposed is warranted in law.  9The applicant's counsel focused on the term of imprisonment of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years before the order for partial accumulation, a sentence which he submitted was excessive for offending which should be assessed by this Court as falling significantly below the mid range for offences of its kind and excessive when comparable cases are considered.  10An agreed statement of facts was tendered on sentence together with a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report from Justice Health.  A victim impact statement was also received.  The applicant gave evidence.  For the purposes of the appeal no issue was taken with her Honour's summary of the facts or the consideration she gave to the applicant's subjective circumstances.  11The applicant had been in a de facto relationship with the victim for about nine years.  They had been separated for 18 months before the offence was committed.  There had been frequent arguments about custody and access to their two daughters, aged six and eight, throughout that time.  After the separation the applicant resumed his consumption of significant quantities of illegal drugs and alcohol from which he was largely abstinent during the course of the relationship.  Her Honour accepted that he used both drugs and alcohol as a means of coping with his relationship breakdown and the separation from his children which in turn precipitated a relapse into criminal offending in company with his former criminal associates.  This offending was the subject of the offences on the second indictment.  12On the day of the offence the applicant drank copious quantities of whisky in company with another man such that by 9.30pm he was heavily intoxicated.  In this state he decided he wanted to see his children and went to the home of his former partner where his daughters lived.  When she opened the door in response to the applicant's shouting and swearing she realised he was drunk and told him to leave or she would call the police.  He continued to shout.  He threatened to kick the door in if she did not open it.  While she was on the phone to 000 he kicked the front door off its hinges, entered the premises, grabbed the victim by the T-shirt and began to pull her outside.  There he verbally abused her and again demanded to see the children.  She grabbed him by the throat to try to force him to release his grip on her whereupon he then grabbed hold of her arm and proceeded to kick the upper part of her legs several times before she managed to struggle free and run back inside the house.  A neighbour appeared and told the applicant to leave.  He left before the police arrived.  The police observed that the victim was limping and was having difficulty bearing weight.  She declined the offer of an ambulance.  They photographed extensive bruising on both legs and marks on her upper arms.  13In emphasising the objective seriousness of the offending and the need for the sentence to reflect general deterrence, her Honour noted the offence was committed in the victim's home where children resided and in the context of a fractured domestic relationship.  In Shaw v R [2008] NSWCCA 58, a case not dissimilar from the present case, I regarded these features as bearing relevantly upon an assessment of objective seriousness.  In Hiron v R [2007] NSWCCA 336 at [32] Price J acknowledged the force of authority in this Court denouncing violent attacks in domestic settings and the need for sentences to reflect the importance of general deterrence and the protection of the vulnerable and, where appropriate, specific deterrence.  14The sentencing judge paid due regard to these factors.  Although she accepted that the applicant did not attend at his former partner's home with the intention of breaking in and assaulting her but because he wanted to see his children, that decision was made under the influence of alcohol which fueled a belief (whether genuine or mistaken) that he was being denied access to his children and which erupted into uncontrolled aggression when, given his state of intoxication and his abusive conduct, the victim refused him access to her home.  Her Honour's description of the offence as ""committed very violently by a man who was very drunk"" was accurate.  15Her Honour considered the applicant's subjective circumstances noting that he was aged 30 at the time of sentence and that he had been treated by community-based mental health services in Victoria and New South Wales for a variety of conditions over many years in relation to his long standing poly substance abuse.  His first contact with the criminal justice system was at age 15.  His criminal record as an adult includes offences of violence which attracted sentences of imprisonment in 2001.  There was however no suggestion that his psychological problems per se were causally related to his offending although, as her Honour noted, he was self-medicating with alcohol at the time.  The report from Professor Greenberg not surprisingly recommended abstinence from drugs of addiction and alcohol and adherence to such treatment programs as are offered by Justice Health whilst in custody and which should be the subject of follow up in the community upon his release.  The report noted that he had been compliant with medication to treat what was diagnosed as a drug induced psychosis (in remission) whilst in custody and, according to the author of the pre-sentence report, has insight into the ramifications of his past behaviour and the need to seek support from community-based services upon his release to avoid any repetition of that behaviour.  16Her Honour accepted that the applicant's remorse and contrition were genuine and that since being in custody he had taken significant steps towards his own rehabilitation, in particular by his determination to address his drug and alcohol abuse.  17Although her Honour did not assess the objective seriousness of the offending relative to mid range offending of its kind and thereby fell into error, and despite erroneously regarding the fact that the offence was committed whilst on bail as a factor aggravating the level of objective seriousness for a standard non-parole period offence, she otherwise correctly identified those features of the offending relevant to such an assessment which in my view would have placed it at or just below mid range.  I do not accept the applicant's submission that it was significantly below mid range.  Were the breaking to have been effected by a weapon and were the children to have witnessed the violence (both matters which featured in Shaw to which I have already referred) the offending would have been liable to have placed within the mid range consistent with my finding in that case.  18Her Honour also considered the applicant's subjective circumstances giving them appropriate weight.  19In the result, and despite the errors which the Crown conceded infected the sentencing exercise, I am not persuaded that an effective sentence of 2 years imprisonment was unwarranted or that another sentence is warranted in law.  In addition, I am not persuaded that the authorities to which counsel referred dictate a different outcome (see Shaw, Terkmani v R [2009] NSWCCA 142; 195 A Crim R 298 , Ngati v R [2008] NSWCCA 3; 180 A Crim R 384 and Zammit v R [2010] NSWCCA 29).  20Without expressing any final view, the outcome of the application for leave to appeal may have been different were the head sentence of 6 years and a non-parole period of 3 years not moderated by the order for partial accumulation in application of the principle of totality.  21The orders I propose are as follows:  1.Leave to appeal is granted.  2.The appeal is dismissed.  **********

The subject premises in question is at 2/489 Valery Road, Valery in the State of New South Wales and the defendants are the owners of these premises. Liability is admitted and the contested issues for determination include causation and the quantum of damages. 

2In the statement of claim as filed on 18 December 2009, the plaintiff pleaded that she suffered the following injuries:

(m)General bodily lacerations; 

(n)Nerve damage in the right leg; 

(o)Shock; and, 

(p)General bodily and psychological trauma. 

4There are significant differences between the plaintiff's account of the nature and extent of her injuries and those noted in the contemporaneous hospital documents. 

The circumstances of the plaintiff's injury 

5The plaintiff went onto the veranda on 28 May 2008 at 10:00pm after it began to rain, in order to bring in the washing. Two of the floorboards on the verandah, which had rotted in the part she trod on, gave way, causing her to fall into the gap, which was sufficiently narrow to prevent her falling right through. 

6The plaintiff was not able to obtain medical assistance at that hour of the night as there was flooding along the roads, but the next morning her partner drove her to the emergency department of the Coffs Harbour Health Campus, the local hospital, which had an emergency section. The plaintiff was seen, after some delay, and the hospital file entry of 29 May 2008 records, in the Triage entry: 

""INJURY LEFT LOWER LEG AND FOOT, FELL THRU VERANDAH"". 

7The medical entry states that the plaintiff: 

""presents with sore left leg and ankle post falling through rotten verandah. Was apparently hanging by leg. Not weight bearing. Tender all toes, foot, ankle and leg. No skin tear or laceration"". 

8An x-ray was taken of the left foot and foreleg. The x-ray results were normal. 

9However in May 2010, two years later, the plaintiff's doctors provided medico-legal reports stating that her right leg, not her left leg, had gone through the hole, and that her right leg had suffered an injury of considerable severity. She told Dr P F Teychenne (exhibit A, page 54), she had fallen into the hole to the level of her right hip and injured her right leg. A similar description was given to Dr Bentivoglio and Dr Buckley. The plaintiff also told Professor G D Champion (31 May 2010) that as a result of her right leg falling into the hole, her left knee was bent so that her left lower leg was bent up behind her. 

10Other injuries, not referred to in the hospital report, were also described to these doctors. The plaintiff told Dr Champion she had reached out in a protective action with her left hand, and experienced forcible extension of her left wrist on the floor, causing an abrasion with a small laceration at the left wrist. There was immediate pain in her right ankle and heel and in her right knee and she also felt some low back pain as she was endeavouring to extricate herself from the hole. 

11The difficulty with these descriptions of the accident and subsequent injuries, given two years after the event, is that it is inconsistent not only with the treating records of the hospital, but with her subsequent treatment in 2008 by her general practitioners. 

12The plaintiff first saw her local GP, Dr A Heslop, on 6 June 2008, about a week after the accident. His entry reads: 

"" Friday June 6 2008 17:23:12 Dr. Andrew Heslop 1. On 27 th May 2008 she fell through rotten floor boards in 2 nd story [sic] house she is renting, and finished up at armpit level suspended. Seen at CHBH A&E the next morning and had XR done then. Said to have chipped bone in the heel. Bruised shin and is for re Xray. Leg is not getting better, and remove bandage as DVT risk. Examination: Swollen lower leg Needs Aspirin 100mgm daily Actions: Diagnostic Imaging requested: X-ray - Fore Leg (L) - 10 days Injury to L Foreleg and is XR to see is [sic] there is periosteal reaction 2.

She is unable to lift R Shoulder and is limited with abduction laterally Diagnostic Imaging requested: X-ray - Shoulder , US - R Shoulder - Slipped on the mossy stairs and injured R shoulder. She is unable to lift R Shoulder and is limited with abduction laterally."" 

13The plaintiff next consulted another doctor in the same practice on Wednesday 16 July 2008, when she saw Dr T Cheney. The entry reads: 

"" Wednesday July 16 2008 16:26:55 Dr. Trevor Cheney asthma playimg [sic] up and family unwell Reasons for contact: Asthma Actions: Prescription added: VENTOLIN CFC-FREE INHALER 100mcg/dose 2 puffs q.4.h. Prescriptions printed: VENTOLIN CFC-FREE INHALER 100mcg/dose 2 puffs q.4.h."" 

14There are no further entries for 2008. There is no evidence the plaintiff received any further medical treatment, although she told the court that she was going to yoga classes and at some stage in 2008 to 2010 had acupuncture and moxibustion. No reports or other information are available. 

15The plaintiff next sought medical assistance from the same medical practice in January 2009, but no complaint was made about her legs. She was more than five months pregnant, but with an ectopic pregnancy. She is noted as having been transferred to hospital by Dr Heslop on Friday 2 January 2009 and an entry appears for 28 January 2009 as follows: 

"" Wednesday January 28 2009 14:07:59 Dr. S Espinosa-Cassanellii 2 weeks post op recovering well occasional pain talking of suing gynescologist [sic] upset re being placed in maternity ward as well as bilat partial salpingectomy info sheet on ectopic pregnancy given encourage gentle exercise to return for PAP smear when next due Examination: scar healing well Abdomen bitmap changed. Reason for contact: Check up Review: p.r.n."" 

16On 29 July 2009, the plaintiff again consulted her local general practitioner. The entry reads: 

"" Wednesday July 29 2009 10:24:42 Dr. Gull Herzberg 1. script for Ventolin and seretide which she got at hospital 4 weeks for her asthma is going well with the seretide 2. has been going to weight watchers for 8 weeks walking 18 000 steps per day is jogging riding requesting sibutramine having done her own research discussed she will take it and Review: in a month Actions: Prescription added: SERETIDE ACCUHALER 250/50 POWDER INH 250mcg-50mcg/dose 2 b.d. m.d.u.

VENTOLIN CFC-FREE INHALER 100mcg/dose 1-2 puffs 4hrly as required Prescription added: SIBUTRAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE CAPSULE 10mg 1 daily m.d.u. Prescriptions printed: SIBUTRAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE CAPSULE 10mg 1 daily m.d.u."" 

17On 26 August 2009, a further entry from Dr Hertzberg reads: 

"" Wednesday August 26 2009 09:35:22 Dr. Gull Hertzberg started reductil after last visit lost 3.3kg in week 1 has dropped a dress size continues with weight watchers satiety comes earlier Plan: continue on 10mg reductil continue all her other weight loss measures Examination: General: BP(Sitting): 101/75 Pulse(Sitting): 76 Actions: Prescriptions printed: SIBUTRAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE CAPSULE 10mg 1 daily m.d.u."" 

18The plaintiff's evidence was that from August 2009 onwards, she no longer consulted her general practitioner and went to the hospital for treatment where she could used the ""GP Access"" accident and emergency system. She told the court that she had no general practitioner for her entire family, including the five children who were born to her and her partner between 11 June 2000 and 28 August 2007. She agreed that she never consulted any general practitioners or other treating doctors concerning back issues. She claimed that she did raise, both with the hospital and her local general practitioners, her problems with her left leg, shoulder, wrist and thumb. The plaintiff said that it was evident that her right knee had been injured, as there was a scar on her right knee which was still visible. She also said that a scar on her left wrist (see Dr Teychenne's report of 12 May 2010, page 2, exhibit A, page 55) was the result of accident. She told the court that there was ""a cut up above my knee"" and although she did not mention blood, I infer from the claims about scarring, that there must have been visual evidence of this kind. 

19Dr J O'Neill (exhibit 1) notes that he found two medical entries during this period, by a Dr Ashton, dated 10 November 2009, which were contained in the file provided to him for the Coffs Harbour Health Campus emergency department. The plaintiff went to the emergency centre complaining of left knee and leg pain, according to this entry. In the first entry, Dr Ashton stated that the plaintiff had ""left knee/leg pain likely secondary to bony contusion plus haematoma from blunt trauma. Abdominal pain likely viral gastroenteritis. Left flank/lower back pain secondary to pushing a car and increased exertion/effort - soft tissue injury"". A later entry for that day stated ""pain in leg much improved. Nausea not as significant now. Wants to go home"". An x-ray to the left knee was to have taken place the following day. 

20The plaintiff's evidence is that she not only injured her right (not left) leg, back and wrist, but that she had complained to hospital staff about injury to her right leg, and asked for the right leg (although not, apparently, her back or wrist) to be x-rayed. The plaintiff said that the x-ray technician told her an x-ray of her right leg could not be performed by him, as he had only been told to x-ray her left leg. 

21The plaintiff, throughout her evidence, paints a picture of substantial and serious injuries to her back, shoulder, wrist, thumb and right leg being not only not recorded but ignored by the hospital staff for the duration of the time that she was in the emergency department, and when she returned the next day. She made similar claims in relation to her visits to her general practitioners, although an alternative explanation was given in relation to the latter, in that she was lucky to have five minutes with the doctor when she saw him, as he only had time to deal with one issue, otherwise she had to pay for a longer consultation. 

22It is not in dispute that the plaintiff never sought any prescription for pain medication at any time. She told the court she was opposed to taking such medication, as the potential to make her drowsy was a risk since she had five children to care for. 

23In order to reconcile these inconsistencies in the plaintiff's evidence, it is necessary to examine with care her evidence, demeanour and consistency of answers in cross-examination. 
The plaintiff's evidence
24In his opening to me, Counsel for the plaintiff told me that I would find the plaintiff an unusual witness, and that the question was whether I accepted her evidence. In his closing submissions, he put to me that the central issue was the plaintiff's credibility. He asked me to take into account that the plaintiff had ""grandiose"" ideas about herself, including unrealistic opinions that she could not only qualify as a nurse, but eventually become an obstetrician, despite leaving school at the age of 15, having a baby at 16 and having five children to care for. He drew my attention to findings set out in the report of Mr P Defina, clinical psychologist, of 4 July 2001 (exhibit 1) as indicating that the plaintiff's intellectual capacity was at best above average. 

25Ultimately the question of whether or not I accept the plaintiff's evidence depends not upon her credibility or demeanour, but upon how I reconcile her version of events as told to the court in these proceedings with the contemporaneous records of the time. The manner in which a trial judge should approach this task is set out by the Court of Appeal in The Nominal Defendant v Kostic [2007] NSWCA 14; Whalan v Kogarah Municipal Council [2007] NSWCA 5; and The Honourable Justice Ipp, ""Problems with Fact-finding"" (2 September 2006) Lawlink, Supreme Court of New South Wales < http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Supreme_Court/ll_sc.nsf/pages/SCO_ipp020906 >. 

26The plaintiff, who was born in 1983, attended Forster Primary School and Forster High School, leaving school (according to the chronology) before attaining her schools certificate. She gave birth to her first child on 11 June 2000, at the age of 16. At the time, she was living with her partner, Nathan, in Nathan's parents' home. Nathan, although 8 years her senior, has effectively never been employed. The plaintiff learned in 2000, the year she gave birth to their first child, that Nathan was schizophrenic and suffered from scoliosis. By reason of his physical disabilities and schizophrenia, he was on a disability pension and that has been the case for the whole of their relationship, which ended earlier this year. 

27Examples of the difference between the plaintiff's description of events and the objective facts can be seen from her statements to Professor Champion (exhibit A, pages 62-63) that at school she was an elite athlete and that she did exceptionally well in the schools certificate but did not proceed to the higher school certificate because of her adolescent pregnancy and childbirth. She told Professor Champion that she sat for her general entrance examination with a view of becoming a registered nurse and that she achieved 98.5%. She said her mother, a sole parent, was a registered nurse. She said at the time of the accident, she was working as a casual nurse from 32 to 65 hours a week, as well as working as a part time receptionist two days a week with a printing business. Her response to an ""incredulous"" reaction (page 63) from Professor Champion was that she went on to explain that she worked on night shifts and she had in fact ceased her assistant nursing role in the nursing home to study full time for one year in an enrolled nursing course through TAFE NSW, as it was not affordable for her to commence course work to become a registered nurse. Although she said she had been an elite athlete, and she still exercised about two hours a day, there was no history of any disorder with her right leg, which Professor Champion described as ""the principal site of her injury"". 

28She also told Professor Champion there was no history of psychological disorder and she had not required any counselling or psychotropic medication despite stresses along the way. (However, Mr Defina, in his report for the defendants, notes the plaintiff was referred to a psychiatrist by the school when she was 10, as the school thought she suffered from ADHD. She saw a psychiatrist once a month until Year 7 and was prescribed dexamphetamine, which she took as prescribed ""until they realised I didn't have a problem"".) 

29The plaintiff was not in fact enrolled in a nursing course through TAFE. She had left school before sitting for her school certificate, and gave birth to her first child, Damien on 11 June 2000, at the age of sixteen. Between 2002 and 2005, the plaintiff attended Tuncurry TAFE in between giving birth to three further children, Sarah (14 June 2001), Kiara (29 September 2002) and Kayla (27 November 2005). Commendably, over this period she also succeeded in obtaining a Certificate III Aged Care worker qualification and undertook a correspondence course for medical receptionist work, which she told the court was a 12-month course. She performed some part time and voluntary work, apparently as part of her TAFE course, according to the chronology with which I was provided. 

30The plaintiff described herself to Dr Champion as working very long hours in two jobs over a number of years. Her evidence to the court was along the same lines. According to both the chronology handed up and to the plaintiff's evidence, after she gave birth to Kayla on 27 November 2005, she went back to work ""the next day"". However, apart from the voluntary work she was doing (whether or not this was part of her TAFE course), she was not employed at all until May 2006, when she commenced work part time for two days a week at Midcoast Printing, a printing firm, for which she was paid approximately $150 per week. 

31Apart from the two weeks leave she had following the accident, on 27 May 2008, she worked for Midcoast Printing until July 2009, when she was retrenched after Midcoast lost a large contract. This is one of a number of inconsistencies between the plaintiff's oral evidence and contemporaneous records. In relation to the plaintiff's employment at Midcoast Printing, the date of May 2006 is given in the plaintiff's further amended statement of particulars. As to the date at which the plaintiff ceased working for Midcoast Printing, I note she told Mr Defina (exhibit 1, page 12) that she ""did not return to her pre-accident employment and had not worked in any capacity other than self-employment since that time"", the self-employment being a reference to a home business she started briefly in November 2010. Mr Defina was ""repeatedly"" advised by the plaintiff that she had not worked in any capacity other than this self-employment. She said she was made redundant in late May 2008 (page 12). This would of course be highly relevant to any psychologist assessing the plaintiff for vocational assessment. In fact, as the claim for past economic loss makes clear, the plaintiff was absent from work for two weeks and returned to her previous duties after the accident. 

32For nine months, while working two days a week at Midcoast Printing, the plaintiff also did part-time (usually on a Saturday and Sunday) shift work two days a week as a Care and Service Employee (CSE) at Bellorana Nursing Home from 23 August 2006 until 21 March 2007 (Exhibit C), a period of nine months. There was a dispute about her work in March 2007 which led to the nursing home telling her that she would not be offered any more work unless she completed a patient lifting course in April 2007. The plaintiff did not do so. She did not return to Bellorana, and at the time of her accident was working two days a week at Midcoast Printing. 

The plaintiff's credibility as a witness 

33Counsel for the plaintiff opened his final submissions by stating that the issue in this case was my assessment of the plaintiff's credibility. However, the issue for determination is the nature and extent of injury arising from the plaintiff's fall through the rotten floor boards of the veranda, and whether the injuries for which she complains are causally related to this accident. 

34The correct approach to a determination of causation, in circumstances where the plaintiff's credibility is an issue, is explained by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Whalan v Kogarah Municipal Council [2007] NSWCA 5 at [41] where the Court noted: 

""[41] To disbelieve a party (or any witness for that matter) who swears his or her oath is a serious finding and not to be undertaken lightly without good and sufficient reasons."" 

35The Court went on to note at [42] that ""inadequacy of reasons is not an infrequent issue in this Court with respect to appeals from the District Court"" and I have accordingly set out at some length the basis upon which I have not accepted the evidence of the plaintiff that she did in fact suffer injuries contrary or different to those described in the contemporaneous hospital and general practitioners' notes and my further finding that her problems with her right leg and shoulder, on the balance of the evidence, are not causally related to her fall through the floor boards. 

36In the The Nominal Defendant v Kostic [2007] NSWCA 14 an issue of causation arose by reason of a delay by the plaintiff in complaining about her lower back pain several weeks after the accident. The issue in dispute between the parties' respective medical experts concerned the delayed onset of lower back pain which the plaintiff experienced; the doctors expressed differing views as to the implications arising from that delay. In relation to the plaintiff's doctors, there was a serious issue as to whether they had been told that there was a delay before the plaintiff reported her lower back pain, and they assumed she had experienced this pain immediately or very shortly after the accident and had reported this fact (at 11). 

37The Court of Appeal explained (at [13]) that, in order to resolve this issue, the trial judge needed to determine a number of critical factual issues. Firstly, there was the question of when the plaintiff first experienced lower back pain; secondly, there is the question of the degree and extent of the back pain she first experienced and how that pain progressed; and thirdly, when the plaintiff first reported this back pain to a medical practitioner. The judge then had to resolve the difference in opinion between the doctors concerning these matters (at [14]). This was not a credibility issue, but a medical question, and one which was clearly defined by the differing opinions of the doctors in their reports. 

38At [43]-[44], Ipp JA warned: 

""[43] In these circumstances, that is, where two medical specialists have expressed the opinion that, from their observation of a patient's behaviour and their examination of the patient, the patient is pretending to have injuries that she does not have, it is not open to the judge to reject that evidence simply on the view - formed from the demeanour of the patient in the witness box - that she was a reliable witness. The judge's belief as to the credibility of a witness, based merely on the witness's demeanour in the witness box, is not a complete answer to a medical opinion based on observation of the witness in the waiting room and on clinical examination. 

[44] Of course, it is open to a judge to reject such medical opinion, but such rejection must be based on other grounds (for example, the unreliability of the doctor's observations, or the credibility of the doctor as a witness, or non-acceptance of the expert views expressed). But the judge cannot reject those views simply because the judge thinks, by reason of the patient's demeanour in the witness box, that the patient is a truthful witness. Indeed, if the doctor's opinion cannot be rejected on appropriate grounds, that opinion may speak volumes about the credibility of the witness. I have elsewhere expressed the inherent unreliability of credibility findings based on demeanour alone: Goodrich Aerospace Pty Ltd v Arsic [2006] NSWCA 187."" 

39The first difficulty is the extent of the delay in reporting the symptoms. The delay in The Nominal Defendant v Kostic which concerned the Court of Appeal was a delay of a matter of weeks or perhaps months; the delay in Tchen v The Nominal Defendant [2010] NSWCA 45 was two months. Unless I accept that the plaintiff told either the hospital or her general practitioners (or both) about her back, right leg and wrist problems during her visits in 2008 and 2009, the delay in complaint and in seeking treatment is one of two years. 

40The second problem is the lack of information about the plaintiff's medical problems in the two years following the accident. I am conscious of the dangers of attaching ""excessive significance"" ( Tchen v The Nominal Defendant [2010] NSWCA 45 at [69]) to medical notes of considerable brevity, prepared for purposes other than litigation. Medical practitioners can, and do, make mistakes about the site of injury; in Tchen , one of the reasons for the Court of Appeal's conclusions that a doctor's report was unreliable was a mistake about which knee was the subject of an ossified lesion (at [84]). However, in Tchen, there were reports to treating doctors two months after the accident, and the mistake about the knee was made by this doctor ""alone"", whereas in these proceedings the treating records all refer to the left knee, there are no reports of any treating doctors served to explain these apparent errors, and there was a delay far in excess of the two months in Tchen in reporting problems which were never recorded as the subject of complaint. In addition, the plaintiff's explanation for not consulting any doctors over this period (financial concerns) is inconsistent with her concession that the general practitioners' practice consulted by her did in fact bulk bill; she said in her evidence that these doctors were friends, and she referred to them by their first names. Mr Defina, the psychologist who prepared a medico-legal report for the defendants, notes the practice provided bulk-billing. 

41This brings me to the question of my assessment of the plaintiff's evidence. The task of a judge considering the credibility of a witness has helpfully been the subject of recent review by Tugendhat J in Thornton v Telegraph Media Group Ltd [2011] EWHC 1884 (QB) at [73]-[74] as follows: 

""[73] There is great assistance to be obtained from extra-judicial writing of Lord Bingham in a chapter headed ""The Judge as Juror: The Judicial Determination of Factual Issues"" (""The Business of Judging"", Oxford 2000, pages 3ff; Current Legal Problems, vol 38 Stevens & Sons Ltd 1985 page 1-27). Lord Bingham cited Sir Richard Eggleston QC Evidence, Proof and Probability (1978), 155 who set out the main tests to be used by a judge to determine whether a witness is lying or not. 

(1) the consistency of the witness's evidence with what is agreed, or clearly shown by other evidence, to have occurred; 

(2) the internal consistency of the witness's evidence; 

(3) consistency with what the witness has said or deposed on other occasions; 

(4) the credit of the witness in relation to matters not germane to the litigation; 

(5) the demeanour of the witness. 

[74] Lord Bingham then added these observations: 

""In choosing between witnesses on the basis of probability, a judge must of course bear in mind that the improbable account may nonetheless be the true one. The improbable is, by definition, as I think Lord Devlin once observed, that which may happen, and obvious injustice could result if a story told in evidence were too readily rejected simply because it was bizarre, surprising or unprecedented.... 

... so long as there is any realistic chance of a witness being honestly mistaken rather than deliberately dishonest a judge will no doubt hold him to be so, not so much out of charity as out of a cautious reluctance to brand anyone a liar (and perjurer) unless he is plainly shown to be such."""" 

42Issues relevant to the plaintiff's credibility are: 

(a)The inconsistency between the plaintiff's account of what she told the hospital on the day and the reports, including the investigations carried out, which were prepared contemporaneously by the hospital staff. This is not a case where the plaintiff tells the court that she did not realise on the day that she had suffered other injuries; her explanation is that she reported these injuries, which were obvious to the naked eye, and that nothing was done; 

(b)Similarly, the discrepancy between the plaintiff's account of her reports concerning her injury (or lack thereof) to the doctors in the general practice which she consulted, over the period from the accident until the time she ceased to consult these doctors. Again, it is not the case that the plaintiff said she was unaware of suffering these injuries; her explanation was that when she referred to these injuries, she was told she just needed to lose weight; 

(c)The plaintiff's failure to provide medical reports or other doctors in relation to other treatment she sought, such as acupuncture and moxibustion; 

(d)The period of delay between the plaintiff's injury and her first report of these injuries to medico-legal experts in May 2010; 

(e)Inconsistencies in the information provided to these medico-legal experts by the plaintiff in relation to the circumstances of her accident, including such other matters as her work history; 

(f)Inconsistencies in the information provided by the plaintiff to experts retained by the defendants to provide medico-legal reports; 

(g)The impact of the surveillance film on the plaintiff's credibility. 

Inconsistencies in the plaintiff's evidence, and their relevance to her credibility 

43In Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [35], Heydon JA states: 

""It is common enough in litigation for witnesses with a truthful story to succumb to the temptation of gilding the lily or over-egging the pudding. The test for the trier of fact is to separate the truthful parts from the rest."" 

44In other words, the fact that a witness tells a lie, or a series of lies, or exaggerates, is not a basis for a rejection of her evidence without careful investigation. I have borne this in mind when considering inconsistencies in the plaintiff's evidence. 

45The evidence given by the plaintiff that was unsatisfactory falls within the following categories: 

(a)Her claims to have suffered injuries which must have been noticeable to the emergency department at the time of the accident which are not noted, such as the scars on her knees and wrists and the injuries to her right leg and shoulder; 

(b)Her explanation for her continuing failure to seek medical assistance in relation to her injuries and disabilities; 

(c)Her explanation for the two year gap before telling medico-legal experts (rather than treating doctors) about her condition; and, 

(d)Her description of her pain levels and what she can and cannot do, and over what period of time. 

46The plaintiff was insistent that she had told the hospital the full extent of her injuries. She said these were obvious, and that she still had the scars. Her explanation for failing to seek medical assistance or advice about her ongoing pain or to obtain pain medication was her distrust of doctors, whom she feared would report her as an unfit mother; she preferred to go to the local hospital emergency department, and this is confirmed by the November 2009 entry found by Mr Defina (this entry also, I note, refers to the left leg). 

47The plaintiff's description of her pain level was that it was constant, despite her taking a packet of 12 Panadol Rapid a day. The pain has been constant since the accident. Surveillance footage was taken of the plaintiff and I have dealt with this evidence in more detail below. 

48The causative relation between the plaintiff's injuries and the disabilities about which she complains requires careful examination of each of the reports tendered on her behalf. 

The evidence of the plaintiff's experts 

49I commence by noting that, in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles at [67], Heydon JA refers to the statement in Ramsay v Watson (1961) 108 CLR 642 that for a medical witness to give evidence ""only that in his opinion something is more probable than not does not conclude the case"". The tribunal of fact must look at the whole of the evidence in order to be satisfied on a balance of probabilities of fact. Heydon JA goes on to explain that the tribunal of fact cannot determine these issues unless the expert fully exposes not only the reasoning relied upon (at [67]), but also by reason of identification of the assumed facts (at [70]). 

50Expert evidence is no better than the facts upon which it is based: R v Kotzmann [1999] 2 VR 123 at 135 per Callaway JA, referred to in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles at [80]. 

51More recently, in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar (2011) 277 ALR 611; (2011) 85 ALJR 694; [2011] HCA 21 Heydon J (as His Honour now is) has reviewed and refined these observations, and noted at [133]: 

""[133] In short, the utility of receiving expert opinions rests in what the trier of fact can make of them. If the assumed facts are not stated, no reasoning process can be stated and the opinion will lack utility; if there is no evidence, called or to be called, capable of supporting the assumed facts, no reasoning process, even if stated, will have utility; and even if there are facts both assumed and capable of being supported by the evidence, they will lack utility if no reasoning process is stated. In each instance, a lack of utility results in irrelevance and inadmissibility."" 

52Analysis of each of the plaintiff's expert reports demonstrates some of these problems. 

Dr Teychenne 

53Dr Teychenne was told by the plaintiff as a result of her injury she was ""unable to continue work as a receptionist"" and that after an initial absence of two weeks ""it was suggested that she work in a commercial premises, but she was unable to do this as this required lifting, standing and doing deliveries"". He therefore considered that the plaintiff was ""partially unfit for duties from the time of the injury"". He was also under the impression that she was working as a nurse and doing studies and he goes on to note that ""she was unable to continue TAFE or university due to the weakness in her right leg"" (page 2, report 9 June 2010). 

54If Dr Teychenne was provided with any medical records, he has certainly not identified them in any of his reports. He does appear to have had at least information about an x-ray of the plaintiff's left foot and left lower leg (page 2, report 9 June 2010) but it is unclear whether he actually saw the report or simply accepted a description of this either in a letter of instruction or from the plaintiff. This is all the more particular since he considers that the plaintiff needs ""repeated assessment by orthopaedic surgeon"". 

55Dr Teychenne clearly has no idea at all as to the contents of the hospital emergency department's notes, or indeed any information about what prior treatment the plaintiff had been having. He certainly makes no reference to either of these matters in his reports. 

56Although Dr Teychenne commences his reports by referring to the code of conduct, and would therefore be aware of his obligation to provide an independent report, he appears simply to have accepted everything the plaintiff said at face value. The concerns expressed by Heydon J in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar at [56] about the partiality of expert witnesses and the dangers of such experts dominating proceedings (at [58]). Dr Teychenne should have been alerted, by the total absence of any prior medical history in support of these injuries, as well as the fact that the only medical evidence he had related to the left leg, showing a normal result. 

57An additional problem with Dr Teychenne's report is the manner in which he has expressed opinions at page 3 of his 9 June 2010 report concerning the plaintiff's loss of earning capacity and need for domestic assistance. 

58Another problem with Dr Teychenne's report relates to the findings he makes as to the EMG performed on the plaintiff's ""lower limbs"". These showed normal results, as did the check of the tarsal tunnel. Although the results are described as ""normal"", he found ""reduced recruitment pattern"" in the muscles. Dr O'Neill comments ""No credence can be given to the EMG findings of Dr Teychenne. Reduced recruitment of EMG pattern on muscle sampling can simply occur because of poor patient effort, often because of pain. Here today, for instance, she could not make an effort on testing power of the right ankle because of apparent pain. No competent neurophysiologist would draw any conclusions based solely on a finding of reduced recruitment pattern"". 

59Dr O'Neill goes on to point out that his own neurological examination was ""essentially normal"" (report 3 November 2010, exhibit 1). 

60An EMG showing essentially normal results but followed with warning references to problems with the ""recruitment pattern"" is precisely the kind of report, as Heydon J warned in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles and more recently in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar at [56]-[59], which is likely to cause a risk of injustice (at [59]). For an expert to advise, in a report designed to be read by a judge where there is no cross-examination, that there is a ""decrease in recruitment pattern"" suggests that although the results are normal, there is a significant problem. He does not expose his reasons for making this claim. Dr O'Neill by comparison has exposed his reasons for explaining why no competent neurophysiologist would pay attention to such a reading. 

61Finally, I note that Dr Teychenne has accepted, without any qualification, all of the plaintiff's claims about her injury and disabilities, however inconsistent. This was not the case with Professor Champion, who did challenge the plaintiff's account of events, and now I turn to a consideration of Professor Champion's reports. 

Professor Champion 

62Professor Champion did have information as to the emergency department Triage record, but says: 

""There is a problem in that the recorded information repeatedly refer to the left side whereas Ms McGlen-McLeod is adamant that this is wrong and that the injury was to her right leg (pointing to the scar over her right kneecap). The presenting problem was stated to be ""Injury left lower leg and foot, fell thru verandah"". The nursing assessment data referred to ""pain mid foot on palpation, pain mid shaft lower leg. Unable to weightbear. Panadol 1200."" The handwritten notes stated that she presented with sore L leg and ankle, post falling through rotten verandah. She was not weightbearing. There were no neurological signs, no obvious deformity. She was tender in all toes of her foot and I think at the ankle (difficult to interpret). There were no stated cutaneous lesion."" 

63I have set out the above paragraph in full because it would appear to be likely to have been dictated by Professor Champion as he read from this report and it includes some interpolations of his own. 

64The plaintiff told Professor Champion that she could not tell which foot and foreleg was actually x-rayed. Professor Champion asked her whether there was any possibility that the early injury had been to her left leg and ""she was emphatic that this was not the case"". 

65Professor Champion comes to the view that it was possible that the hospital staff picked up on the left-sided symptoms and ""presumably ignored the right-sided symptoms"". However, the plaintiff ""emphasised that compression bandages were definitely applied to her right leg, covering the knee and heel/ankle region"". This causes Professor Champion to take the view that the notes where ""clearly inadequate"" as there was no description of what actually happened except for ""falling through rotten verandah"" and ""was apparently hanging by leg"", in circumstances where the examination findings did not refer to whether the left or right side was involved. 

66Professor Champion also asked about subsequent visits and was told: 

""She did not see any doctor after the initial hospital visit, explaining that the doctors in Bellingen do not bulk bill (Medicare only) and it was not affordable."" 

67The plaintiff told Professor Champion that she returned to her receptionist job but on restricted activities, but that she was not able to commence an enrolled nursing course because of requirements to work in a ward (report 31 May 2010, page 4). When she did commence seeing her local general practitioner in early 2009, according to Professor Champion ""the main concern expressed to him was about her right foot and ankle and her knee. It was interfering with her capacity to power walk or to run, and thus with her weight control regimen"". 

68In fact, the plaintiff's medical records showed she was visiting her general practitioner as early as June 2008 and that there is no complaint of this nature. Further, Dr Heslop, when he saw her on 6 June 2008, not only removed the bandage on her left leg because of a DVT risk (noting ""swollen lower left leg"") but arranged for diagnostic imaging ""to see is [sic] there is periosteal reaction"". He also requested an x-ray of her right shoulder after she slipped on the mossy stairs at the hospital on her first day on crutches and ""rehurt sore L leg and R shoulder"". 

69As to the prescription of sibutramine hydrochloride, Dr Hertzberg notes that she requested this having done her own research. The plaintiff was someone capable of giving a clear description of any medical problems she had, and of having opinions about her treatment. 

70Professor Champion felt ""somewhat incredulous about the pre-accident history as recorded and wondered to what extent it was believable"" and, in particular, said he was ""not sure what to make of the left-right problem"". What convinced him to accept the plaintiff consisted of three factors. The first was that he considered the medical notes at the emergency ward as ""markedly deficient"". The second was the scar on her knee. The third was that the plaintiff ""considered it unaffordable to seek medical care after two initial weeks off work"" when in fact she was seeing Dr Heslop on Friday 6 June, Dr Cheney on Wednesday 16 July 2008. 

71Professor Champion's conclusion (page 9, report 31 May 2010) that the plaintiff had not been fit for work since the accident, and that she was unfit in the foreseeable future for her pre-accident employment or similar work, is presumably based on the information he was given in his report, namely that the plaintiff had been unable to return to her pre-accident employment, although she had returned to her receptionist job (by inference, for some short period on restricted duties) when in fact her employment after the accident consisted of returning to the same employment as she had before. The plaintiff's nursing activities had ceased in March of the same year by reason of the complaints process having been initiated against her. 

72Professor Champion's second report of 8 August 2010 consists of comments concerning the MRI lumbar spine, right knee report and right ankle report. I shall deal with each of these in turn: 

(a)MRI lumbar spine - Professor Champion helpfully describes the pathology in this report as ""relatively modest"", although noting there was frequently a poor match between findings on imaging and clinical findings in relation to pain. In other words, spinal damage could be non-symptomatic, or there could be pain complaints where the imaging reports showed little or no difficult problems. His conclusion is that if he was the plaintiff's treating doctor he would require re-examination to be sure of the physical signs with a follow up report in a few months. He considers that the L4/5 disc lesion, while consistent with the accident and the injury claimed, reveals only a minor part of a substantial regional pain problem. He suggested a pain rehabilitation service and conservative treatment. 

This is a cautious summary of the findings where essentially what he is saying is that if he was managing the plaintiff's care, he would request a re-examination, but that a problem of some kind which is capable of being referrable to the accident exists. 

(b)MRI right knee - Professor Champion notes a mix of pre-existed disorder with post-traumatic influence, which ""strongly supports her report of pain-related disability"" but recommends orthopaedic consultation by an orthopaedic surgeon specialising in arthroscopy of knees. 

(c)MRI right ankle - Professor Champion complains that there is ""a lot of jargon in this report and some of it is rather difficult to interpret without matching the report to the films"", suggesting that he may not have been able to see the films. Some of the findings, such as oedema, ""may well reflect recent injury as in the subject accident"". Again he suggests referral to an orthopaedic surgeon specialising in foot and ankle surgery. 

73Professor Champion has addressed many of the obvious inconsistencies in the plaintiff's description of events. However, he has not been given accurate information as to the plaintiff's history of seeking treatment, nor has he been given an accurate work history. 

74I cannot speculate as to what would Professor Champion's response have been if he had been made aware of the follow up reports of Dr Heslop or Dr Cheney. I accept Professor Champion's conclusions that these injuries, by their nature, are consistent with the circumstances of the plaintiff's fall. I also note the failure of the defendants to serve its orthopaedic report. 

75While I accept Professor Champion's opinion that the plaintiff's injuries to her knee and back are injuries of the kind capable of being caused by the circumstances of her accident, I do not accept that they were in fact so caused. I have the benefit of additional objective evidence, including an accurate picture of the plaintiff's work history and the notes, however brief, of her treating doctors. 

Report of Dr S Buckley of 9 June 2010 

76Dr Buckley was told that the plaintiff injured her right leg when the floor boards collapsed with the result that her ""whole leg right up to the hip went through"". He was told she had ""lacerations of her leg and serious pain"". He was told she was investigated by the hospital which gave x-rays which was said to be normal, but not told that these related to the left leg and not the right. He was told that she was given crutches but slipped over the next day using them ""and thus suffered further injury to the right leg"". I note the inconsistency between this and the notes of Dr Heslop. 

77As to the plaintiff's work history, the description given to Dr Buckley bears little relation to reality. The description he gives is: 

"" WORK BEFORE ACCIDENT She has usually worked as a Nurse and at the time of the accident, however, was working at Midcoast Printing as a Receptionist some 12 to 32 hours a week on a casual basis and at the Bellorana Nursing Home up to 65 hours a week doing many double shifts. WORK SINCE ACCIDENT She was off work for two weeks from the printing [sic] and ceased work at the Nursing Home to undertake the Enrolled Nurse Course but was never able to actually commence it because of the accident. After about 6 months she returned to work at the Printers but had difficulty with sitting and typing. As a result she has had no work in the last 18 months and has not been studying."" 

78As to the injuries, the plaintiff told him that she had complained of back pain ""when first seen after the accident"". 

79As was the case with Dr Teychenne, there is no reference to what documents, if any, Dr Buckley saw. He has no information at all about the confusion about the left and right leg. He did examine both legs, noting that left knee was ""unremarkable"" and the left hip revealed ""a full range of movement with negative sacroiliac joint stress tests"", but noted that ""no images or scans were available for my review"" (page 5). 

80Given the completely inaccurate work history with which he was provided, and the failure to provide Dr Buckley with any medical information, his report is of little or no assistance. 

Dr J Bentivoglio 

81Dr Bentivoglio notes (at page 6) that the plaintiff ""did not have any investigations with her today. Indeed, except for the first lot of x-rays she had taken of her person which excluded any fractures, she has not had any investigations at all"". His report of 2 August 2010 notes the small annular tear at the L4/5 level in the lumbar spine region with a mild discal abnormality at that level, but considers that surgery is not indicated. He recommends an exercise-based program to build up her core strength. In his report of 10 August 2010, Dr Bentivoglio notes that at the time of consultation, the plaintiff had not advised of any ankle injury and he considered she had only a ""relatively minor injury to the ankle region, nothing that would require any specific modalities of treatment and nothing that would leave her with any long term disability"". He does, however, expressed concerns about the MRI scan of her right knee, noting that this ""may well have developed from the specific incident she described in May 2008"". 

82Dr Bentivoglio has clearly not been informed there is any challenge to the form of notes or treatment provided by the hospital she attended. In fact, he notes that when she went to the hospital ""appropriate x-rays were taken and she was supplied with crutches"" (page 2, 29 June 2010 report). His report is therefore based on a significant gap in the information. 

83In addition, the information he had about the impact of the injury on her working history was based on erroneous facts. He recorded her work history as follows: 

""At the time of her injury she was working in reception at a nursing home. She worked on a permanent casual basis averaging approximately 35 hours per week. She lost about two weeks off work. She then had a graduated return to the workforce. Although she is currently unemployed she is due to start back working in the near future. The only active treatment she is having at this stage is talking pain-relieving medications and using heat treatment."" 

84Dr Bentivoglio's report is similarly of limited assistance to me by reasons of these omissions in the factual material made available to him. 

The surveillance video 

85For many years there was a practice of showing surveillance film in cross-examination without prior indication that such film had been taken ( McGuiness v Kellogg Co of Great Britain Ltd [1988] 1 WLR 913; Halpan v Lumley General Insurance Ltd [2009] NSWCA 372). The practice of producing the surveillance film at the trial has increasingly come into conflict with changing concepts of case management and procedural fairness. The introduction of rules in similar form to Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) Pt 31 r 31.10 resulted in courts in England and in Western Australia refusing to permit withholding disclosure until trial ( Brown v Metro Meat International Ltd [2000] WASCA 123 at [24] ( obiter ); Boyes v Colins [2000] 23 WAR 123; [2000] WASCA 344; Digby v Essex County Council [1994] PIQR P 53; Khan v Armaguard Ltd [1994] 1 WLR 1204). In Jaber v Rockdale City Council [2008] NSWCA 98 at [56], Tobias JA cautioned: 

""[56] A number of other issues were canvassed during the course of the hearing, including the use made by the primary judge of surveillance footage of the appellant, transferred onto DVD, relating to his post injury activities. In my view his Honour's use of the DVD was not relevant to either of the two issues of liability which I have canvassed above. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for me to deal with it. However, I would wish to make it clear that, had it been necessary, I would have upheld the appellant's submission that his Honour erred in permitting the appellant, during the course of cross-examination, to be shown the DVD, thereby allowing evidence concerning its contents to be elicited in circumstances where ultimately, when it was sought to tender the DVD, his Honour excluded it pursuant to s 135(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). In my view his Honour ought not to have permitted the DVD to be utilised at all."" 

86The issue of whether such film should be disclosed before trial has been dealt with in a series of decisions of this court. McLoughlin DCJ held in Grace v Shad (District Court of New South Wales, McLoughlin DCJ, 6 August 2010) that the notification provisions in UCPR Pt 31 r 31.10 did not apply to surveillance film. In Oraha v The Nominal Defendant (District Court of New South Wales, 1 October 2010); Beard v North Coast Area Health Service (District Court of New South Wales, 11 November 2010) and Annetts v State of New South Wales (District Court of New South Wales, 19 November 2010) Letherbarrow SC DCJ held that these notification provisions did apply. 

87The defendants in these proceedings, shortly before trial, sought a ruling from this court to be permitted to rely upon surveillance film of the plaintiff shot over several days in November 2010 and March 2011. The order sought was granted. That means that the plaintiff was aware, prior to giving evidence, that surveillance film would be relied upon in relation to her claims of ongoing disability. 

88Where a plaintiff has advance notice of such film ( Ralston v Bell & Smith t/a Xentex Patch & Grout [2010] NSWSC 245 at [160]) there is an opportunity to deal with this by evidence in reply or explanation. In Ralston v Bell & Smith t/a Xentex Patch & Grout the film was made available to medico-legal experts, but that was not done in these proceedings. Nevertheless, the plaintiff has been made aware that the claims she made to doctors about the extent of her disabilities would be the subject of challenge based on the surveillance film. However, the plaintiff responded to the film with angry and at times tearful statements that she was in fact in constant pain throughout. 

89The films show the plaintiff walking energetically to and from the children's school, a distance of several kilometres, in a vigorous fashion, pushing a child in a stroller, covering a variety of surfaces such as grassy and uneven surfaces, hills and concrete barriers over which she has to push the pram. She is also seen going up and down stairs, shopping and sitting. The plaintiff agreed she walked to the children's school every day, saying this was part of her weight reduction programme. (The plaintiff, whose weight has ranged between 90 and 137 kilos, said in her evidence that she has had a significant concern about her weight for about ten years, and relies upon regular daily exercise to lose weight.) 

90Although the plaintiff can be seen walking briskly (without a limp) for some hours on each of these days, that was not how she presented to Ms Warner, an occupational therapist who prepared a report on 10 May 2010. Ms Warner noted the plaintiff's ""mobility was restricted"", walked with a ""noticeable limp"" and ""was unable to fully bend the right knee"" (Exhibit A, report 10 May 2010, p. 5). Although the plaintiff is seen stooping quickly and in an unguarded fashion to pick up dropped items several times in the surveillance film, she told Ms Warner (p. 5) that ""any bending or stooping causes aggravation of her low back pain."" A list of her continuing problems, as reported to Ms Warner (p. 6), include: 

""* Difficulty walking long distances; 

*Difficulty negotiating sloping or uneven surfaces; 

*Pain in her right knee and heel aggravated by prolonged standing and walking, negotiating uneven ground, working at low levels and stair climbing; 

*Difficulty in prolonged sitting or standing; 

* Difficulty with repetitive or heavy manual handling; 

* Difficulty with stair climbing 

* Constant and severe pain in the right leg and knee."" 

91The plaintiff told Ms Warner she could only walk for 20 minutes on a level surface and that she had not driven her car since the injury. Ms Warner adds that travelling in a motor vehicle ""even as a passenger"" causes ""a significant increase in her low back pain and her right knee pain and stiffness"" (p. 18). The plaintiff is observed, in the surveillance video, to get into and out of the passenger seat of the motor vehicle without difficulty when travelling with her family. 

92The plaintiff also told Ms Warner that since the accident ""she is unable to perform the household shopping with assistance from her family, as she is unable to push a fully laden trolley, carry heavy bags of groceries or reach low shelves."" (p. 20). The plaintiff is observed in the surveillance video, to spend several hours shopping with her partner, during the whole of which time she is seen pushing a pram containing their youngest child. When they leave the shopping centre a shopping bag is hanging from one handle of this pram. Ms Warner recommended professional assistance with shopping, at the rate of $77 per week, for the rest of the plaintiff's life, on the basis that her partner's psychiatric condition may prevent him from providing this assistance in future. 

93Ms Warner's recommendations are made on the basis of these instructions. Her recommendations include an assertion that the plaintiff may deteriorate ""significantly"" (p. 12) in later life and that she was likely to require mobility aids such as a wheel chair. 

94The plaintiff said that she had to walk the children to school, despite being in constant pain, because she needed the exercise to lose weight, as well as to look after her children, but that to do so she had to take three or four Panadol each morning. She said she took a packet of 12 Panadol a day. 

95The surveillance film shows the plaintiff walking briskly for several hours and, from concessions she made in her evidence, it would appear that she walks this much on a daily basis. Her claim that she was in constant pain when she did so is hard to reconcile with her unguarded gait and brisk pace, her ability to stoop down quickly and being able to push a pram containing a child for long periods. 

96While the plaintiff does have knee and back findings indicating she has problems, the surveillance video shows she is able to go about her daily activities without any obvious restrictions. The surveillance video also shows that the plaintiff's claims to Ms Warner about the extent of her ongoing disabilities were grossly exaggerated. 

Failure to call the plaintiff's former partner 

97The plaintiff's partner, Nathan, witnessed the plaintiff having to extricate herself from the veranda floor boards hole and drove her to the hospital the following day. The report of Ms Warner refers to the substantial additional household tasks he is called upon to perform because of the plaintiff's inability to perform them since the accident. He is also observed in the surveillance film, the most recent being March 24, 2011. 

98The plaintiff told the court that she had decided to terminate her relationship with Nathan and had told him to leave their home. He has been returning for access to the children, but when he stays overnight the parties occupy separate rooms. He is currently staying in the plaintiff's home to care for the children while she is in Sydney giving evidence. 

99The defendants asks me to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference ( Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298; [1959] ALR 367; (1959) 32 ALJR 395; (1959) 76 WN (NSW) 278) concerning the plaintiff's failure to call her former partner. Mr Quinlivan, for the plaintiff, while noting that the separation had been unpleasant and involved complaints to the police, conceded that such an inference should be drawn. 

100I accordingly draw a Jones v Dunkel inference. 

Failure of the defendants to serve an orthopaedic medico-legal report 

101After the plaintiff attended the offices of an orthopaedic surgeon for the purposes of a medico-legal report for the defendants, the defendants did not serve this report. 

102I consider this a significant omission. Neither of the other medico-legal reports served by the defendants are orthopaedic reports. 

103The report of Dr O'Neill, a neurologist (Exhibit 1) answers many of the issues raised by Dr Teychenne. The report of Mr Defina, a psychologist, provides some valuable insights into the plaintiff's medical history, but cannot assist in relation to the plaintiff's orthopaedic injuries. 

Conclusions as to the cause of the injuries complained of by the plaintiff 

104The plaintiff does not complain about injuries to her left leg. If I accept the description of her injuries as set out in the hospital and treating general practitioners' records, the plaintiff has suffered minor injuries which resolved after her being on crutches for about 6 weeks. 

105Mr Quinlivan submits that, while there ""certainly"" is a deficit of corroboration of the plaintiff's claim, it is clear from Professor Champion's report that the plaintiff has significant problems in both her back and her knee. The plaintiff's medical records before the accident show she did not have any pre-existing condition. Accordingly, if no other explanation is on offer as to how she has suffered these injuries, if there is objective evidence of an injury and, at a later time, of a disability that medical evidence suggests could be causally related, then I should, according to Mr Quinlivan, accept the plaintiff's evidence that she did in fact suffer these injuries in the accident the subject of this claim for damages. 

106The problem of inconsistency between a plaintiff's account of injuries and the description (or omission) of such injuries in contemporaneous medical records, is not uncommon. Doctors, especially treating doctors, do not write down information from a patient in a comprehensive fashion. Sometimes their records may fall well short of what should be noted. 

107The issue of reconciliation of inconsistent contemporaneous medical records when compared to the plaintiff's evidence of complaints and injuries has been considered and explained by the NSW Court of Appeal in Container Terminals Australia Ltd v Huseyin [2008] NSWCA 320 and Mason v Demasi [2009] NSWCA 27, and I have taken account of their Honours' warnings to trial judges about the correct methods of assessment of evidence where such inconsistencies occur. Such cases, however, turn on their facts. In the present case, even if I were to accept Professor Champion's complaint about the inadequacy of the hospital notes, the evidence of the general practitioner who saw her to remove the bandage is persuasive, as are the other factual issues upon which I have made findings, including the lengthy period of delay before the disabilities were raised, and the exaggerations as to their degree. 

108Taking all of the above into account, I am satisfied that the plaintiff's injuries were those set out in the medical records, namely the injury to her leg, which she ""rehurt"" the day after bandaging by the hospital staff, when she slipped on the mossy steps at the hospital, and for which she sought treatment from her general practitioner, who removed the bandage for DVT reasons. 

Quantum of damages 

109Having made these findings of fact I now consider the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiff. 

Non-economic loss 

110The defendants submit that if I accept the plaintiff's injuries conformably with the medical records, she has suffered only a soft tissue injury which has resolved. This falls well short of the threshold. Mr Quinlivan, for the plaintiff, urged me not to make this finding, but did not make any submissions to the effect that any such injury could exceed the threshold. I accordingly assess non-economic loss at zero. 

111In the event that I have erred in this finding, I note that if I were to accept the plaintiff's injuries to her back, right knee and right foot, the plaintiff submits that these injuries will persist (Professor Champion, pages 68-69). It is submitted that the plaintiff will require specialist and general practitioner review, physiotherapy and analgesia. Her capacity for exercise, housework, childcare and employment will be compromised ""indefinitely"" and it is estimated that she is between 30-32% of the most extreme case. I consider this to be excessive, given the degree of activity she is capable of, and if I had accepted this evidence would have assessed this as 25%. 

Past and future economic loss 

112The plaintiff had two weeks away from work from Midcoast Printing which would amount to $300 in terms of loss wages. She returned to work at Midcoast Printing, working in the same job for the same hours, until she was retrenched in July 2009 following loss of a large contract by her employers. She was provided with a reference which spoke of her willingness to work in glowing terms. The defendants submit that this is the total of her past economic loss, although a figure of $600 rather than $300 was agreed to be reasonable. I consider that is an appropriate figure which allows for the plaintiff being uncomfortable during the period that she returned to work while on crutches. 

113Mr Quinlivan, in his submissions on behalf of the plaintiff, acknowledged that she was not employed as an aged-care worker at the time of the accident, nor was she in the market for such work until about August or September 2008, after her youngest son was weaned. However, she had not been fit for such work since the accident on 28 May 2008. Mr Quinlivan noted the plaintiff gave evidence that over the past three years she has looked for nursing work. She eventually gave up looking, accepting that she is not fit for the work (reliant upon the medical evidence tendered on her behalf indicating she has been unfit from the time of her accident). He submitted that the plaintiff's income earning capacity from approximately August 2008 would be at least $500 per week, in reliance upon the job match report of Mr Defina, if she had been working full time. He sought a cushion of $25,000 for past economic loss. 

114I note the plaintiff became pregnant in 2008 and most distressingly lost the child following an emergency operation in January 2009. The plaintiff did not in fact apply for any work, nor did she complete the patient lifting course which would have enabled her to seek work with the nursing home at which she had previously worked. Accordingly, even if I had accepted the evidence of the plaintiff concerning her injuries, I would not have awarded her past economic loss in relation to those injuries and ongoing disabilities. She continued to breastfeed her youngest child until he was three years old, planned an addition to her family and was the prime carer for her five children. These activities indicate she was not considering a return to work and her stated future ambition appears to be a return to studies in nursing, not employment. 

Future economic loss 

115As I have accepted the evidence that the plaintiff suffered soft tissue injuries only, which have completely resolved, I consider she is not entitled to any claim for future economic loss. 

116Mr Quinlivan submitted that the plaintiff will never be able to return to nursing type work and that occupations requiring lengthy periods of standing, sitting, bending, kneeling or squatting are beyond her capabilities. She retains a capacity for undertaking some clerical duties in the 40 years of working life in front of her. It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that a reasonable ""cushion"" is reached by allowing an assumed loss of $150 per week for 37 years, discounted in the usual way for contingencies ($150 x 893.6 x 75% = $100,530). 

117I presume that the cushion figure proposed includes superannuation, for both past and future economic loss. 

118The defendants submit that even if the plaintiff's injuries were related, the plaintiff's future plans include a number of years of study and then work as a nurse or obstetrician. No return to the work force, even in the form of part time work of the kind she performed at Midcoast Printing, is planned for some years. 

119The plaintiff's future economic loss, if her injuries are accepted as being what she claims, are difficult to assess. Doing the best I can, she would be entitled to a cushion of the kind proposed by Mr Quinlivan. I have taken into account, in this regard, the defendant's failure to serve its orthopaedic report, prepared after a consultation arranged for the plaintiff for the purpose of this litigation. 

Past and future domestic assistance 

120The plaintiff submits that from the time of the accident she has required additional assistance for seven hours a week since the accident, which is 170 weeks ago, which would total $28,560. The plaintiff appears to have abandoned reliance upon the many items set out in Ms Warner's report. 

121As to future domestic assistance, it is submitted that future domestic assistance in the sum of three hours per week at commercial rates of $38.50 per hour for 40 years would result in the figure of $106,000 (917.5 x $38.50). 

122The defendants submit that whatever my findings as to injury, the plaintiff has not, and will not, require any assistance in the home of any compensable kind capable of reaching the threshold, and draws my attention to the plaintiff's fitness as shown on the surveillance video. The defendants also submit that the plaintiff fails to reach the threshold for both past and future home assistance and draws my attention to Miller v Galderisi [2009] NSWCA 353. 

123I agree with this submission. The plaintiff is not entitled to any award for past or future homecare. The plaintiff's physical abilities, as demonstrated in the surveillance film are such that she would not have difficulty performing most normal household chores. 

Past and future out-of-pocket expenses 

124Past out-of-pocket expenses are agreed at $100. 

125Future out-of-pocket expenses are the subject of substantial compromise by the plaintiff. What is sought is a cushion of $10,000 to allow for analgesia, physiotherapy, general practitioner, specialist consultations and ""a possibility of more sophisticated and invasive and expensive therapies and procedures"". 

126As to future out-of-pocket expenses, the defendants submit that the plaintiff is seeing no doctors and taking no medication referable to injuries arising from her accident. 

127I accept the defendants' submissions. In the event that I have erred in so finding, the cushion proposed by Mr Quinlivan is both realistic and appropriate. 

128Accordingly the amount for past and future out of pockets is $100. 

Costs 

129I have not received any submissions as to why I should make any order other than that costs follow the event. Notwithstanding the very small sum involved, that is the order that I propose to make, as liability was not admitted until after proceedings were commenced and the subject of case management. I have granted liberty to restore in relation to any costs applications. 

Orders 

(1)Judgment for the plaintiff for $700. 
(2)Defendants pay plaintiff's costs. 
(3)Liberty to restore in relation to costs. 
(4)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

		28 October 2011",2011-10-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2415603,Stevens - Application pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 by [2011] NSWSC 1252,"DECISION 

1The applicant, Gary John Stevens, applies under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the Act) for a referral of his case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

2It is not altogether clear from the applicant's handwritten application whether he challenges the sentences that were imposed and his conviction following pleas of guilty to 11 counts of offences of dishonesty, contained on two indictments. In substance, the applicant contends that ""the sentence was vitiated by error"" and that ""the offences charged in counts 6 to 10 of the second indictment are bad for duplicity and/or latently ambiguous"". In so far as this latter contention raises the prospect that the applicant was wrongly convicted of those counts, I propose to treat the application as one against his overall sentence and his conviction in respect of those counts. 

3The history of the proceedings and the basis upon which the applicant came to be sentenced are conveniently set out by the Chief Judge at Common Law in Stevens v R [2009] NSWCCA 260 at [10] and [14] to [32], when the Court of Criminal Appeal (Spigelman CJ and Grove J agreeing) dismissed the applicant's appeal against sentence. The applicant originally pleaded guilty on 6 December 2007 and was sentenced on 25 February 2008. His appeal against sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed on 28 October 2009. :- 

10 First Indictment: 
This indictment contained only one count being: Use false instrument with intent contrary to s 300(2) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment. Second indictment: Counts 1, 2 and 3: Possession of a false travel document contrary to s 22 of the Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act 2005 (Cth) for which the maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment. Counts 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10: Obtain a benefit by deception contrary to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is 5 years imprisonment. 


14 The total non-parole period imposed was 6 years and 3 months imprisonment commencing 29 November 2006 and expiring 28 February 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months expiring on 28 May 2015. 
15 A statement of the relevant facts was agreed and tendered to the sentencing judge. It is unnecessary to restate the facts in full and I gratefully adopt the summary provided by the respondent in its written submissions to this Court. 
First indictment 
16 The applicant entered a Westpac Bank branch in Sydney on 30 January 1990 and asked to cash a cheque for $6,700. It was dated 20 January 1990, was made out to ""cash"" and signed (apparently by a J Nealer""). The applicant said he was ""Gary Anderson"" and explained that he needed to pay overdue wages to employees of a pool company. Earlier, the bank manager had received a call from a man who said he was ""John Nealer of F J Hawkes & Co"" and that he had given a cheque to someone and asked if that person could come into the branch to cash the cheque. He explained that he had been asked to make a payment for a swimming pool (on behalf of Doug Sayer who was apparently overseas) and that his account only had $700 in it but that he would cover the payment first thing the next morning from an expected bonus payment. At the branch, the applicant gave the bank manager a business card in the name of ""John L Nealer"". The manager checked the account balance (which was $1,200) and subsequently gave the applicant $6,700 in cash. The manager being suspicious caused the security camera to be activated as the applicant left the branch. 
17 On 1 February 1990 Douglas Sayer (who worked at F J Hawkes & Co) discovered that a cheque was missing from his cheque book. He went to the Westpac branch and identified the missing cheque as being the one which the applicant had cashed on 30 January. Apparently the signature on the cheque was a poor imitation of Mr Nealer's signature. 
18 When the applicant was questioned by the police on 20 August 1990 he said he had cashed the cheque at the behest of a person (whom he had met at the races) after explaining that he was broke. He said that the person gave him $500 for cashing the cheque - $200 for his efforts, and $300 as a loan. 
19 After his arrest, the applicant was admitted to bail. He pleaded not guilty on the date of committal for trial (25 February 1991), which was set down for 26 August 1992. He failed to appear. He had left Australia on a flight bound for the UK on 14 June 1992. A bench warrant was issued and executed. He was arrested on 29 November 2006 for the offences in the 2 nd indictment. He pleaded guilty on 6 December 2007 in the District Court. 
20 During the proceedings on sentence the Crown provided written submissions to his Honour which disclosed that the applicant, after returning to Australia, had moved in and out of the country several times between 1998 and 2006. However, there was no suggestion that he had used a fraudulent passport to facilitate his travel. 
Second indictment - counts 1, 2 and 3 
21 On 29 November 2006 a search warrant was executed at the applicant's home, during which three United Kingdom passports were found, each in different names, but with the applicant's photo on them. 
22 The sentencing judge noted that he had no information about how the applicant came to possess the passports, except that he would have participated in their creation by providing his photo. He noted that they could have readily been used to facilitate fraudulent behaviour, that it was of ""substantial significance that there were three passports capable of providing evidence of three separate false identifies"", and his Honour had ""no doubt that they were intended to be utilised for multiple frauds."" 
Second indictment - count 4 
23 On 31 occasions between 9 may and 4 October 2003 the applicant was photographed making cash withdrawals (averaging $1,000) from ATMs in the eastern suburbs. He withdraw a total of $29,920 from a Westpac Bank account in the name of ""Chad Thorpe"". The funds in this account had been sourced from unauthorised internet transfers (by a person unknown) from a joint account held in Westpac. These unauthorised transfers (conducted between April and November 2003) totalled $504,120 from which a total of $290,950 was deposited via the internet into the account of ""Chad Thorp"". 
Second indictment - count 5 
24 On 17 occasions between 23 July and 1 October 2003 the applicant was photographed making cash withdrawals (averaging $1,000) from ATMs in the eastern suburbs. He withdraw a total of $16,480 from a Westpac Bank account in the name of ""Chad Munce"". The funds in this account had been sourced from unauthorised internet transfers (by a person unknown) from a joint account held in Westpac. These unauthorised transfers (conducted between April and November 2003) totalled $504,120 from which a total of $90,170 was deposited via the internet into the account of ""Chad Munce"". 
Second indictment - counts 6 and 7 
25 On 31 October 2006 the applicant used the internet to transfer $36,650 and $222,000 from an ING Bank account (held by Dr Jeffrey Ichilcik) into a Commonwealth Bank account which had been opened in the name of ""Brendan Urquart-Eastwood"" on 30 August 2006. On 1 and 2 November 2006 Mr Urquart-Eastwood withdrew money from that account via ATMs. On 23 October 2006 the applicant had called the ING Bank (giving his name as ""Jeffrey Ichilcik"") and re-set ""his"" internet banking password after answering personal information. Using internet banking, the mailing and residential addresses held for the ING Bank account were changed (to a Potts Point address linked to a hostel at which both the applicant and Mr Urquart-Eastwood had been seen by police); the contact email address was changed, as were the contact phone numbers - the subscribers were neither the appellant nor Dr Ichilcik, and a mobile phone (with the same new number that had been registered on the account) was found during a search of the applicant's home. On a number of occasions a male person also rang the bank in relation to the account and his voice was recorded (and identified as being the voice of the applicant). During the search of the applicant's home a number of personal, business and financial documents of Dr Ichilcik were found, in addition to handwritten notes relating to Dr Ichilcik. The Crown case was that the applicant obtained access to Dr Ichilcik's personal information through theft of his mail. 
Second indictment - counts 8 and 9 
26 On 7 August 2006 a customer of Westpac Bank paid off her and her husband's Visa card and cancelled that account. On 28 August an unknown person rang the bank (stating he was Mr Willmore, one of the joint account holders) and changed the contact address to the same Potts Point hostel address as in counts 7 and 8. Internet banking facilities for the bank account and credit card held by Mr and Mrs Willmore were re-activated. 
27 Between 31 August and 23 September 2006 12 unauthorised transfers (from various internet cafes) totalling $32,620 were made from Mr and Mrs Willmore's bank account to another Westpac Bank account in the name of ""Elaine Barbara Paul"". This account was opened on 25 August 2006. Identification was provided in the form of Commonwealth Bank, St George Bank, Medicare and Pensioner Concession cards. The address associated with the Potts Point Hostel was given. Between 4 and 25 September 2006, the $32,260 was withdrawn from this account from a number of ATMs. 
28 Over the same period, four unauthorised transfers totalling $10,590 were made from Mr and Mrs Willmore's bank account to a St George Bank account in the name of ""Timothy Joel Russell"". This account was opened on 28 August 2006. Identification was provided in the form of a Queensland driver's licence, as well as Medicare and Pensioner Concession cards. The address given was the same as the mailing address for Ms Paul's account. Between 13 and 18 September 2006, the $10,590 was withdrawn from this account from a number of ATMs. 
29 When the applicant's house was searched, the police found two ATM cards in his wallet in the names of ""Elaine B Paul"" and ""T J Russell"". Other papers found by the police in his home included an account statement for Mr Willmore from the Westpac Bank. The Crown case was that the applicant obtained access to Mr Willmore's personal information through theft of his mail. 
Second indictment - count 10 
30 On 5 April 2006 an unknown person accessed Westpac Bank's internet banking and changed the password and address (to the same Potts Point address as above) for an account held by Emery Eric Korda. On 26 April another Westpac Bank account was opened via telephone in the name of Emery Eric Korda. Due to the telephone operator's error, the account was opened immediately without a 100-point check being conducted in a branch. 
31 Between 26 April and 23 May 2006 15 unauthorised internet transfers totalling $54,675 were made from Emery Eric Korda's bank account into the new bank account which had been opened in his name. Between these dates a total of $54,335 was transferred from the new account opened in Emery Eric Korda's name to a Commonwealth Bank account in the name of ""Elaine Barbara Paul"". This account had been opened on 14 February 2005 with a Medicare card, Energy bill, Pensioner Concession card and passbook account produced as identification. Between 27 April and 25 May 2006, $54,301.41 was withdrawn from Elaine Barbara Paul's account from a number of ATMs (including in Auckland, New Zealand, where the applicant was identified by a witness as being at the time). 
32 When the applicant's house was searched, the police found documents in relation to the opening of the second Westpac Bank account in Emery Eric Korda's name. The Crown case was that the applicant obtained access to Mr Korda's personal information through theft of his mail. 

4It should be observed that the offences described above were in the nature of identity theft, and that the sentencing proceedings were conducted on the basis of an agreed statement of facts. The applicant's senior counsel on the hearing of the appeal (who was not his counsel on sentence) at no stage took issue with the facts summarised for the purposes of the appeal and at no stage took the point now taken by the applicant, namely that counts 6 to 10 were bad for duplicity or latently ambiguous. 

5The error said by the applicant to vitiate the sentence can only, if established, affect the sentences imposed in respect of counts 4 to 10 inclusive on the second indictment. When delivering remarks on sentence in relation to those counts, the sentencing judge stated ""in all, he engaged in some 139 separate instances of dishonest conduct in the offences charged in counts 4 to 10 inclusive."" The applicant maintains that this statement, which derived from submissions made by the Crown's representative on the sentencing proceedings on 6 December 2007, necessarily leads to the conclusion that he was sentenced on the basis of 139 offences. 

6The applicant states that ""the total offences for which I took responsibility and thus pleaded guilty to was 53"". Whilst it appears that the applicant arrives at this figure by reference to court attendance notices that subsequently became the subject of the counts in the second indictment, the applicant has overlooked the fact that at least three charges that were the subject of court attendance notices were themselves rolled up charges encapsulating other offences. When one factors those offences into the total number of offences underlying counts 4 to 10 on the second indictment, there were in fact 81 offences underlying counts 4 to 10 of that indictment. 

7The confusion arises partly because each count on the second indictment comprehended a number of transactions, each of which were capable of constituting offences in themselves. It is clear from the summary of facts in the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment that each count on the indictment therefore represented a rolled up count encapsulating a number of offences of a like kind. 

8The Crown's submission to the judge was erroneous. It appears from the transcript of 6 December 2007 that the Crown's representative construed each paragraph of a very lengthy statement of facts as referable to a separate offence, thus producing a total of 139 episodes of dishonest conduct which became the subject of counts 4 to 10. This error was not discovered by the applicant's counsel on sentence, nor by his senior counsel on the hearing of the appeal. 

9Following a consideration of the sentences which were passed in respect of those counts, and having regard to the factors taken into account on sentence, I am of the view that these matters do not give rise to any sense of unease or disquiet that would justify the referral of the applicant's sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal for a second time. 

10The applicant received a sentence of three years imprisonment on each of counts 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, including a non-parole period of two years, to be served entirely concurrently with each other . On count 10, the applicant received a non-parole period of 1 year with a period on parole of 2 years and 3 months, also entirely concurrent with the previous sentences. On any view, these sentences are extremely lenient, having regard to the maximum penalty for each offence (five years imprisonment) and the extensive nature of the applicant's offending constituted by those counts. 

11The offences were committed against a number of victims, some of whom were vulnerable, in that they were elderly and unsophisticated, over an extended period of time. The criminality comprehended by counts 4 to 10 on the second indictment extended from 9 May 2003 through to 1 November 2006. The total amount of funds obtained by deception in respect of these counts was $402,935:00. As noted by the Chief Judge at Common Law, the offences involve the creation of bogus bank accounts and fraudulent access to Internet banking facilities in order to transfer funds into the bogus accounts. The applicant used the stolen personal records of a number of people to carry out the scheme. 

12Notwithstanding the fact that there were some offences that were committed in concert with other unknown persons (namely, those who had stolen the necessary identity records), the applicant himself was ""a central player"" in the setting up of the bogus accounts. The nature of the offences required a significant element of general deterrence. Moreover, the applicant committed these offences whilst at large, having failed to answer bail in respect of an offence of dishonesty in 1992. The conduct which was the subject of count 10 on the second indictment occurred while the applicant was subject to a recognizance following the imposition of a suspended sentence. 

13Leaving to one side the sentences imposed in respect of these counts, there can be no complaint with respect to the overall sentence received by the applicant. An aggregate non parole period of 6 years and three months with a balance of term of two years and three months barely represents the totality of the criminality represented by the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty. 

14The applicant's second ground for the application may be briefly dealt with. 

15The charges constituted by counts 6 to 10 on the second indictment were preferred under s 178 BA of the Crimes Act 1900. In each case, the applicant was charged that he did ""by a deception, namely, by causing a computer system to electronically transfer funds without being authorised to do so, .. dishonestly obtain for himself a financial advantage"". Each of those offences referred to deposits, being the financial advantage, in discrete amounts, namely, $36,650 in respect of count 6, $222,000 in respect of count 7, $32,620 in respect of count 8, $10,590 in respect of count 9 and $54,675 in respect of count 10. 

16The applicant's contention is that there were two separate offences contained within the one offence that was the subject of each of counts 6 to 10 in the second indictment and that those two separate offences were so vague that they could not constitute one transaction. According to the applicant, those two separate offences are ""obtain benefit by deception"" and ""causing a computer system to transfer funds without being authorised"". 

17The expression of counts 6 to 10 on the second indictment was entirely in conformity with the ingredients of the charge under s 178 BA of the Crimes Act. The act of causing the computer system to transfer funds to another account in the absence of authorisation constitutes the deception for the purposes of the offence. 

18Further, the applicant's complaint that these counts were ambiguous and lacking in detail stems from the absence in the statement of facts of any demonstration of who ultimately received the sums of money the subject of those counts. This argument is misconstrued. The benefit to the applicant was constituted by the deposit of the funds into the bogus accounts which were operated and controlled by the applicant or his accomplices. It has never been a necessary ingredient of the charge under s 178 BA that the offender physically received the cash that has been withdrawn. Putting that matter to one side, there was evidence within the statement of facts that supported the conclusion that the applicant did receive cash on occasions. 

19The applicants further complaint, namely that the prosecution was unable to prove that the applicant himself had physically authorised the transfers to the bogus accounts, was the subject of argument in the Court of Criminal Appeal. In the course of his Honour's judgment, the Chief Judge at Common Law said at [67] :- 

The applicant submitted that it had been alleged by the respondent that he was the principal only in relation to counts 6 and 7 and that his Honour failed to take this into account. However, when the applicant pleaded guilty he accepted that he was guilty of offences by which he deceptively caused the electronic transfers and obtained a financial benefit for himself. The applicant was a central player in all of the offences. The applicant's counsel accepted, during the sentence hearing, that the applicant ""has to have been involved with those who organised the scheme."" His Honour found that the applicant acted in concert with accomplices. Whatever was the applicant's actual degree of involvement in setting up the bogus accounts and theft of the personal records it was he who made the relevant withdrawals and otherwise completed the offences. The findings which his Honour made as to his involvement were clearly open. 

20Next, the applicant complains that the terminology of parts of counts 6 to 10 on the second indictment provides ""textbook examples of duplicity and/or ambiguity"". The suspect terminology to which the applicant refers is the reference to ""at a place unknown"" and ""at other places"". Again, this complaint is misconstrued. That form of expression is entirely consistent with the way in which charges are often expressed in conventional indictments and does not run foul of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

21To similar effect is the applicant's complaint with respect to the expression of counts 6 and 7 over a span of dates. 

22Such other inconsequential errors in the course of the remarks on sentence upon which the applicant relies are not capable of producing any different result in the sentence ultimately imposed. A number of minor errors in the remarks on sentence were identified in the Court of Criminal Appeal and, to the extent that they were the subject of grounds of the application in that Court, they were dealt with to finality. 

23To the extent that the applicant now argues that his pleas of guilty to counts 6 to 10 on the second indictment were entered in ignorance of the true state of affairs, the applicant does not advance the application for the purposes of withdrawing his pleas of guilty. As was noted in the Court of Criminal Appeal, the applicant's pleas of guilty necessarily admitted the necessary legal ingredients of all of the offences. There is no basis apparent on the face of the application for a grant of leave to allow the applicant to withdraw those pleas of guilty. 

24I have largely dealt with the merits of the application. However, there are cogent reasons for refusing to consider or otherwise deal with the application in so far as it relies on assertions of duplicity and ambiguity. Section 79(3) of the Act allows the Court to refuse to deal with the application if it appears that the matter raised by the convicted person is the subject of a right of appeal, yet no such appeal or application has been made and the Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or circumstances that justify further dealing with the application. There is no explanation advanced by the applicant for his failure to appeal his conviction in relation to counts 6 to 10 on the second indictment, nor have any special facts or circumstances been demonstrated by him. 

25In all of these circumstances, I refuse the application.

		24 October 2011",2011-10-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2415779,R v PERREAU [2011] NSWDC 234,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: Ian Perreau has pleaded guilty to one offence that between 6 February 2003 and 8 September 2004 he disposed of money which was it reasonable to suspect was the proceeds of crime. In fact what he did was on eighty-five separate occasions receive cash, sometimes in quite large amounts, and deposit that cash into nominated bank accounts, sometimes using a false name.

2He was working in the finance industry when he was spoken to by his father's cousin. He was then contacted by a man he knew as ""Dean"" who arranged for these transactions to take place, saying that he had been referred to the offender by his cousin. The offender trusted his cousin and, thus, at least initially, trusted Dean. 

3The offender gave evidence that whilst he initially believed that things were above board and that handling large sums of cash was consistent with the behaviour he had seen other parts of Asia, eventually he realised that things were not above board. The amounts of money had increased and he was being contacted by strangers. Despite that, for a time he continued to accept cash and deposit it into nominated bank accounts. Eventually however he and his wife, his wife being aware of what had been happening, spoke about the position they had got themselves in and decided that they would voluntarily cease this activity. 

4It is apparent that the offender and his wife kept meticulous records of what they had done and, indeed, the police were able to access those records when they eventually searched the offender's premises. I gather that there is no dispute between the parties that those records demonstrate that Mr Perreau did voluntarily cease his illegal activity. Although the records show that there used to be transactions many times a month, in the month before the police arrived there were no transactions at all.

5The offender was born in Singapore. He came to Australia some time ago. He had a good upbringing in Singapore and has a good relationship with his parents and his siblings. They did not know about this offence until relatively recently. Mr Perreau completed the HSC in Australia and has since then worked in various aspects of finance. He is currently working for Westpac. His resume was tendered today which shows that he has done well for himself and his employers over the years. He needs a licence to conduct his current work and I have no doubt that it is a condition of his employment with Westpac that he not have criminal convictions. The conviction which must inevitably follow his plea of guilty to this offence will therefore necessarily have a significant impact upon his ability to work in his chosen field. 

6I will note that the offender has pleaded guilty at a late stage and so his willingness to facilitate the course of justice is to be rewarded by a discounted sentence of a relatively modest amount in the order of ten per cent. The plea of guilty is also one other fact which has led to me imposing a different form of penalty from that which might otherwise have been imposed.

7The offender is of otherwise good character. There is evidence of this aspect in both a negative and positive sense, negative in the sense that he has no other criminal convictions and positive in the sense that he has done good work as the references attest. The offender told police, and there is nothing to contradict him in this area, that he received a relatively modest amount, in the order of half a per cent to one per cent of each transaction. Given that there was something in the order of $3million in total over the period of his offending he received something between $15,000 and $30,000. In terms of his moral culpability I do find as the offender said, that whilst initially he thought that these transactions were above board he later came to realise that they were not.

8The Crown referred to the offender using the name ""John Jacobsen"". The offender explained that he wished to use a false name when depositing the money in order to prevent perhaps corrupt bank tellers accessing his records, he banking at the same bank, in order to protect himself from robbery or other offences because of the large amounts of cash which the tellers would know he was carrying. It is not a case where he created a false bank account or anything of that kind, he simply put on the deposit slip the name ""John Jacobsen"" rather than the name Ian Perreau. 

9So in terms of moral culpability the offender has continued to engage in these transactions even after he became suspicious and, indeed, probably confident, that things were not above board. But as I have found and as there is no real challenge to this from the Crown, he did voluntarily cease his illegal activity about a month before the police turned up on his door. 

10He gave evidence that he is now ashamed and embarrassed for what he has done and that he knows that he has let people down. I watched him in the witness box and I am satisfied that he is remorseful for what he has done, and in particular he is very conscious of the affect that his offending has had on his family. 

11I now wish to speak about, as the cliché suggests, ""the elephant in the room"". That is, the delay which has been apparent in the prosecution of this matter by the authorities. These offences ended in September 2004 and the police turned up on Mr Perreau's doorstep in late 2004. He was not charged until five years later. Indeed, in the meantime he had contacted the police when he needed to go overseas on a conference and got his passport back. So over that five years the offender has been left in a state of great suspense. Initially of course he would have expected that this day would come fairly soon, but as time went on, and given that his passport was returned, it appears to be the case that he began to believe that this might be behind him. He gave evidence that he and his wife had just decided, for example, to put in a pool, shortly before the police again turned up on his doorstep telling him he had been charged and presenting him with the Court Attendance Notice. 

12Over the five years the offender did not do things easily either. The stress of what might one day occur was part of what led to the breakdown of the relationship with his wife, although they reconciled. After the Court Attendance Notices were served (on his wife's birthday) their relationship has deteriorated again. It is not going too far to say that the offender has paid a high price already for his offending behaviour. Part of that has come about because of the delay, and he will continue to pay an even higher price once he discloses to Westpac that he has been convicted of this offence. 

13Of course the delay has also been relevant in this sense. It has enabled Mr Perreau to demonstrate that he is not going to re-offend, that this is very much an isolated breach of the criminal law on his part. The authorities speak about the need for understanding and flexibility of approach where delay of this kind is a feature of matters that come for sentence. I am not sure what I would have done to Mr Perreau if I was dealing with him soon after these offences had been committed, but I am sure that the delay in this case is a very significant matter which has had a large impact on the sentence that I am going to impose on Mr Perreau.

14The Crown refers to general deterrence. Of course general deterrence is important in cases of this kind. It is one of the weapons that the authorities have in an effort to deter crime by reducing the opportunities for criminals to have access to their ill-gotten gains. But it is at least ironic that the Crown now seeks to suggest the seriousness of this conduct when the matter does not appear to have been treated at all seriously by the authorities for five years. 

15The prosecution referred to three comparative cases, two of which led to comparatively short periods of imprisonment. While such sentences may, and I say only may, have been appropriate in this case if I was sentencing Mr Perreau five years ago, the impact of the delay on the sentence that I will now impose is such that I propose to accede to Mr Brady's submission and impose upon Mr Perreau a suspended sentence of imprisonment of twelve months.

16I impose a sentence of imprisonment of twelve months, I order that it be suspended under 20(1)(b) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act on condition the offender giving self security without a surety in the sum of $1000. It is a condition of the bond that thereby results that the offender is to be of good behaviour for the period of the bond. He is to appear before this Court if called upon to do so at any time. He is to advise the Registrar of this Court of any change in his residential address.

		20 July 2012",2011-11-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2415824,R v BRADY [2011] NSWDC 235,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: At a human level the story of Matthew Thomas Brady that I am about to relate is a story of immense sadness. The manner in which he has ended up before me today facing sentences for five very serious offences is one which is impossible to describe without feeling a great deal of emotion. As a human being it is terribly sad to send this young man to gaol but as a judge it is my duty to do so. 

2The offender is the second eldest in a family of five siblings. He went to Jannali High School until he was seventeen, completing Year 11. But when he was eighteen an unimaginable tragedy occurred. His father committed suicide by shooting himself whilst at home. His sister, the offender's aunt, Joanne Brady and his children rushed into the room where the father had taken his own life. He was transported to hospital with the offender remaining by his side for hours after he had been pronounced dead. 

3That was bad enough, but soon after that the offender's mother deserted the family. Mr Brady and his younger siblings had nowhere to go. They were taken in at great financial and emotional cost by his aunt, his late father's sister. She, a single mother with one child at home and one child living away from home, took in Mr Brady and his three younger siblings. Space was tight and emotions were raw. Ms Brady had a full time job and the need for her to keep working to support her suddenly enlarged family was obvious.

4Living next door to her was a man named Billy Illievski. He had recently been released from gaol and, not surprisingly, Ms Brady had her concerns about him. These concerns increased when her nephew began spending time with Mr Illievski. She remonstrated with Mr Illievski demanding that he stop associating with Mr Brady but she was ignored. At this time Mr Brady, who had lost both his parents in different circumstances, was vulnerable in the extreme. His aunt described extremely disturbing behaviour which manifested itself while the offender was asleep. He was unemployed, isolated from friends, drinking to excess and experiencing ongoing grief.

5It was in these circumstances that he was recruited by Mr Illievski to join an extremely serious criminal enterprise involving Illievski and two others from the Macedonian community, Velko Kostovski and Blagoya Nikolovski. The three of them had developed a highly organised and planned procedure for committing large scale thefts from retail premises after breaking into them.

6The offender now stands to be sentenced for five offences of aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence namely stealing, the circumstance of aggravation being that on each occasion he was in company with others. When I sentence him for one of those matters he asked that I take into account a further five broadly similar offences.

7The first of the offences involving the offender occurred on 26 July 2009. On that occasion the offender and Illievski went to the South Strathfield Officeworks store. They cut their way through a fence to get to the rear fire exit door where Illievski cut a large circular hole with a cordless drill. He was thus able to put his hand through the hole and open the door. The offender and Illievski then removed twenty-three laptops with a total retail value of more than $23,000.

8The next offence appears on the Form 1. On that occasion the offender was in company with Kostovski when they went to a different Officeworks store, broke in and again stole numerous laptop computers. 

9The next offence is count 2 on the indictment. It was committed on 2 December 2009 when the offender, Illievski and Kostovski went to the Domayne complex in Parramatta Road, Auburn. Kostovski cut through the barbed wire fence of the rear of the complex. Illievski then drilled holes in an external fire door and used a cordless sabre saw to cut between the four points he had drilled. This created a hole large enough to put his hand through and open the door from the inside. The three offenders then went inside and stole iPods, iPhones, laptop computers and portable GPS systems. The total value of the property taken on this occasion was in the order of $48,000.

10The next offence is on the Form 1. On 19 January 2010 the offender, Kostovski and Illievski broke and entered the Orange Grove Officeworks store with intent to commit a serious indictable offence. The next day the three of them went to a shop in O'Riordan Street, Alexandria, broke in and stole numerous electric drills, drill bits and a sum of cash. That offence also appears on the Form 1. 

11A few days later they committed the third offence to appear on the indictment. It was on 31 January when all four offenders, that is this offender, Illievski, Kostovski and Nikolovski, together with a fifth person, went to the Domayne/Harvey Norman complex in O'Riordan Street, Alexandria. Illievski and Kostovski cut through the barbed wire fence. Illievski cut a hole through the wooden door at the rear allowing him to put his hand through and open the door, then Illievski and Kostovski used a crowbar to open an internal fire door allowing entry into the store.

12Once inside each of the offenders ran to predetermined sections inside the store and stole property that they had been allocated to steal. External CCTV footage reveal that one of the motor vehicles used to transport the offenders and the loot was registered to this offender. No doubt because there were five people involved, the total retail value of the property taken on this occasion was larger than any of the other offences involving this offender. In total the offenders managed to take property with a retail value of $54,680. It is this offence that has the Form 1 matters attached to it.

13The next offence is count 4 on the indictment. On 7 March 2010 the offender, Nikolovski and Kostovski went to The Good Guys store in Banksia. Some time around 10pm that night Kostovski cut a hole in an external fire door using a cordless drill and a sabre saw. Once inside the offenders targeted those sections in the store that contained the iPods, mobile phones and GPS systems. As they did on other occasions they had to smash a number of glass display cabinets to get to the property they were after. What was stolen was then taken to the offender's house. The retail value of the property taken on this occasion totalled $25,000.

14The next matter is the final offence appearing on the indictment, an offence committed on 10 March 2010. This time the target of this offender, Nikolovski and Kostovski was Uniden Australia in Banksia. The offenders cut a hole in a perimeter fence security fence and then used a crowbar to break the locking mechanism on a rear entry door. Inside the premises, which was a warehouse, was a locked security cage. The offenders broke into that cage and then stole a number of GPS navigation systems, cordless phones and two-way radios. The total amount of that property was almost $55,000. 

15However a garbage collector disturbed the offenders so they all ran away. The came back to move the offender's motor vehicle with the stolen property inside it. Police stopped the vehicle with the offender and Nikolovski in it and saw incriminating items. The offenders then drove to Nikolovski's premises where the stolen property was stored. 

16The final two offences appear on the Form 1. On 30 March the offenders attempted to break and enter into the Domayne store on Parramatta Road but were foiled before they could succeed. The following night this offender and Illievski broke and entered the Domayne store in O'Riordan Street, Alexandria intending to steal from those premises but were stopped by police before they could do so. The offender was arrested with items relevant to these offences being found in his car. In an interview with police he denied committing any of these offences. He was later charged and spent eight days in custody before being granted bail.

17As is obvious the offences I have just described reveal criminality at a significant level. There was a high degree of planning and organisation that went into each of these offences which caused substantial loss. Each of the offences on the indictment carries a maximum penalty of twenty years and a standard non parole period of five years. I have taken both of those guideposts into account. My reasons for not imposing the standard non parole period for any of these offences appear in these remarks on sentence.

18It is often said in these courts that an offender has been led astray after getting mixed up with the wrong crowd. Although it is often said, it is rarely so clearly the case as in this matter. The offender, who had shown no antisocial tendencies, was befriended by a much older man at a time that he was extremely vulnerable. He was thereby introduced to other older criminals. The three of them were all significant criminals, each of whom had served time in prison for various offences. 

19Before 26 July 2009 no-one had any concerns about the offender's behaviour. But things changed when in tragic circumstances well beyond his control he found himself living next to Billy Illievski. Since being released on bail he has turned out to be quite a different young man to the person he was when he was committing these offences. He no longer drinks to excess and he found work as a truck driver for a demolition company working nine to ten hours each day, six days a week. 

20The offender was described by his employer as an asset to the company who had never missed a day's work and was always on time. He has been receiving counselling which is of substantial benefit to him. There is therefore much to be said for the proposition that these offences were out of the offender's usual character. Perhaps the one qualification for that was the period over which these offences occurred, eight months, and the number of offences committed. Nevertheless I am prepared to make a finding in the offender's favour that he is now a very different person to the person he as when he committed this serious series of offences.

21It is suggested in the pre-sentence report as well as the two psychological reports tendered on the offender's behalf that he is remorseful and has accepted responsibility for his actions. The offender did not give evidence before me so I was unable to judge for myself the validity of those statements. I note also that the offender's plea of guilty came late indeed which suggested if the offender is truly remorseful that feeling has only come upon him recently. However once more I am prepared to make a finding in the offender's favour based on the opinions of the two psychologists who have seen the offender and heard what he has to say about his wrongdoing. 

22Notwithstanding the lateness of the offender's plea it still had a utilitarian value and so I will impose upon him a sentence which is about ten per cent less than it would otherwise have been. 

23I am also prepared to find that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and in a real sense has been rehabilitated already. He has never had a problem with drugs or gambling and has put his time of excessive drinking behind him. It is unfortunate in the extreme that his prospects of rehabilitation will be adversely affected by the sentence I must necessarily impose upon him.

24On his release from custody he will find it much harder to get a job because of his criminal history and will have spent a significant period of time mixing in gaol with hardened criminals, being exposed to their morals or lack of them and their way of life. 

25Kostovski and Nikolovski were sentenced by me in December last year. Issues of parity loom large. The offender should not have a sense of grievance when he compares the sentence I impose upon him with the sentences that I earlier imposed upon two of his three co-offenders.

26I note that Illievski has pleaded not guilty and is facing trial early next year. At that trial evidence will be given against him by Kostovski and Nikolovski. Because of the assistance that they have given and have promised to give the authorities, in particular by giving evidence for the prosecution against this offender and Illievski, I discounted the sentence I would otherwise have imposed upon them by fifty per cent. That is of course a significant matter to be borne in mind when a comparison is made between the sentences I will impose upon this offender with the sentences I imposed upon the co-offenders last year.

27This offender of course is not to be punished for deciding that he would not give evidence against Illievski. It remains the case however that he does not get the substantial discount that would be available to him had he offered to give evidence and assist the authorities in that way.

28Other factors affecting parity include that this offender was very much the junior partner in the criminal enterprise. As I have mentioned his co-offenders were older, much more deeply involved and the prime movers in the criminal enterprise. They both had serious and numerous offences on their criminal history. 

29Mr Ainsworth who appeared for the offender suggested, albeit somewhat tentatively, that a sentence which would not see his client return to full time custody could be imposed. Mr Ainsworth suggested a suspended sentence. I need not consider that matter further because the length of the sentences I decided to impose is such that no alternative to full time custody is possible.

30Notwithstanding the absolutely awful experience the offender suffered at the age of eighteen which was exacerbated by the behaviour of his mother it is a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence needs to reflect the objective gravity of an offender's conduct. Here, where there are a numerous series of offences involving a total loss of property in offences involving this offender approaching a quarter of a million dollars there is unfortunately no alternative but that the offender serve a significant period in gaol.

31It is terribly sad at the way both his parents have treated him with serious and lasting consequences, but as I began these remarks on sentence it is necessary for me to perform the role of a judge and take into account matters other than the personal situation of the offender. The principles of general deterrence for example while perhaps having less relevance because of the offender's youth and the circumstances in which he was drawn into the series of offences nevertheless require the imposition of a sentence which will have some effect in deterring others who may be tempted to also get themselves involved in serious criminal conduct of this kind.

32There are special circumstances in this case. As I mentioned the offender's prospects of rehabilitation will be diminished by him having to serve a period of full time custody and the ongoing psychological consequences for him of both his parents' actions have suggested a need for a significant variation from the statutory ratio between the non parole period and head sentence. 

33For counts 1 and 2 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of one year four months and a head sentence of two years eight months to date from 3 November 2011. 

34For counts 4 and 5 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non parole period of one year four months and a head sentence of two years eight months to date from 3 May 2012.

35For count 3 taking into account the matters on the Form 1 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years and a head sentence of four years to date from 3 November 2012. 

36Thus the effective sentence consists of a non parole period of three years with a period of eligibility for parole of two years. The offender's non-parole period will expire on 2 November 2014 on which date he is eligible to be released to parole.

		01 August 2012",2011-11-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2416204,Lawson v Dunlevy [2012] NSWSC 48,"Judgment  1On 17 August 2011, Magistrate Dunlevy, the first defendant, continued a grant of conditional bail to Jeremy Lawson, the plaintiff, during a hearing at the Local Court at Wilcannia.  2One of the bail conditions imposed was that Mr Lawson was  ""...not to consume alcohol for any reason, and is to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer.""  3On 14 November 2011, Mr Lawson commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court seeking, pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970, to have orders made which have the effect of:  (a)declaring so much of the condition as required submission to a breath test as unlawful; and  (b)quashing that part of the condition.  4No challenge was made to that part of the Condition that required Mr Lawson to refrain from consuming alcohol for any reason.  5For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that the imposition of a bail condition which required Mr Lawson to submit to a breath test is unlawful and relief ought be granted.  Accepted Facts  6The following facts were not challenged before me, and were accepted by both Mr Lawson and Constable Monique Gowans, the second defendant, who was the active contradictor in the proceedings.  Magistrate Dunlevy took no active part in the proceedings and filed a submitting appearance.  7On 18 June 2011, police officers arrested Mr Lawson for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.  The victim of the assault was alleged to be Stephanie Hunter, with whom Mr Lawson was living with in a domestic relationship.  They have five children aged between 1 and 10 years.  8Mr Lawson was, after his arrest, taken by Constable Gowans to the Wilcannia Police Station.  There he was granted bail by an appropriately authorised police officer, which was conditional upon Mr Lawson entering into an agreement  ""...to observe specified requirements as to my conduct whilst at liberty on bail ...""  9There were three specified requirements:  (a)that Mr Lawson reside at a nominated address;  (b)that Mr Lawson was ""... not to consume alcohol for any reason, and is to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer ""; and  (c)that Mr Lawson was to abide by the conditions set out in the Apprehended Violence Order which had been made that day.  10Mr Lawson was bailed to appear in the Local Court at Wilcannia on 21 September 2011.  11On 17 August 2011, the Local Court was sitting in Wilcannia.  Application was made to Magistrate Dunlevy to vary Mr Lawson's bail conditions so as to delete from them the words ""... and is to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer ... "" which I will, for convenience, refer to as the "" impugned condition "".  12Magistrate Dunlevy, in an ex tempore judgment, which was, if I may say so with respect, most pellucid, declined to vary the bail conditions and continued Mr Lawson's conditional bail on the same terms and conditions which the police had imposed.  13In this Court, Ms Felicity Graham, a solicitor with the Aboriginal Legal Service, affirmed an affidavit on 11 November 2011 which included the following matters, which were neither objected to nor challenged by cross-examination:  (a)the Local Court Magistrate who presides in Broken Hill, Wentworth, Wilcannia and Balranald, regularly imposes a bail condition requiring submission to breath testing by police;  (b)authorised police officers in the Barrier and Deniliquin Local Area Commands also regularly impose such a condition when granting bail; and  (c)the condition is routinely re-imposed by the authorised justice or magistrate who presides at the first and subsequent court appearances.  14In the Police Facts Sheet, created by one of the arresting police officers Senior Constable Michael Scharf, a request was made that Mr Lawson be placed on ""alcohol bail"", an expression used to describe the condition imposed, part of which is challenged.  The use of this shorthand expression, confirms the evidence of Ms Graham that this condition is imposed regularly, as a matter of routine and in a standard form.  Bail Act 1978  15Bail is a statutory concept, the basis of which is to be found in the Bail Act 1978.  Whether or not the impugned condition is permissible, can only be determined by a consideration of the legislation and the established principles by which the legislation is interpreted.  16Before identifying the relevant provision of the Bail Act , it is appropriate to restate the central principles of statutory interpretation which are engaged in this case:  (a)the starting point for statutory interpretation is to engage in a purposive construction, that is, to prefer a construction which promotes the purpose and/or object underlying an Act: Carr v Western Australia [2007] HCA 47; 232 CLR 138 at [5]-[6] per Gleeson CJ;  (b)the primary object of legislative interpretation is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all of the provisions of the statute: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355 at [69] and [71] per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ; and  (c)it is well established that a statute should not be assumed to abrogate existing fundamental rights in the absence of clear language: Gifford v Strang Patrick Stevedoring Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 33; 214 CLR 269 at [36] per McHugh J; Harrison v Melhem [2008] 72 NSWLR 380 at [209]-[221] per Basten JA, Spigelman CJ agreeing at [2].  17It is appropriate now to identify the relevant provisions of the legislation.  Bail is to be granted in accordance with the Bail Act but only with respect to certain identified periods: s 6.  If bail is granted, then the person is entitled to be released from custody (if appropriate) and is entitled to remain at liberty until required to appear before a court: s 7.  18When bail is conditional, then the right to remain at liberty is subject to compliance with the conditions which are imposed, because where a condition is apparently breached, then the person may be arrested: s 50.  19The authority for police to grant bail, and the procedures to be followed are set forth in Part 3 of the Bail Act .  An authorised police officer may only grant bail in accordance with the Bail Act : s 17(1).  The authority for a court to grant bail is found in Part 4 of the Bail Act .  20Part 5 of the Bail Act contains provisions that apply to bail whether granted by police or by a court.  Of importance to a grant of bail, are the terms of s 32(1) which provide for the criteria and matters to be considered in granting bail.  Shortly put these criteria are:  (a)the probability that the person will appear in court when next required: s 32(1)(a);  (b)the interests of the person: s 32(1)(b); and  (c)protection of a particular person, or the community generally: s 32(1)(b1); s 32(1)(c).  21In considering the protection of the community, the likelihood of a person committing any serious offence whilst on bail, can only be considered if the court reaches the view that the person is likely to commit one or more serious offences, and that likelihood is sufficiently serious, when considered with the likely consequences, as to outweigh: ""...the person's general right to be at liberty "": s 32(2).  This is a statutory confirmation (if one were needed) of the general right of an individual to be at liberty.  However, as a matter of the common law, there was no such general right once a person had been arrested.  Hence the need for the Bail Act .  22It is to be observed that these matters as set out in s 32 constitute the entirety of the matters that a court (or an authorised police officer) is entitled to take into account in determining whether to grant bail.  23Division 3 of Part 5 of the Bail Act deals with conditions which may be imposed.  Sections 36, 36A and 36B list the only conditions that can be imposed when conditional bail is granted.  24Importantly for the issues raised in this case, s 37 provides:  "" 37 Restrictions on imposing bail conditions  (1) Bail shall be granted unconditionally unless the authorised officer or court is of the opinion that one or more conditions should be imposed for the purpose of:  (a) promoting effective law enforcement, or  (b) the protection and welfare of any specially affected person, or  (c) the protection and welfare of the community, or  (d) reducing the likelihood of future offences being committed by promoting the treatment or rehabilitation of an accused person.  (2) Conditions shall not be imposed that are any more onerous for the accused person than appear to the authorised officer or court to be required:  (a) by the nature of the offence, or  (b) for the protection and welfare of any specially affected person, or  (c) by the circumstances of the accused person.""  25In the circumstances of this case, the final purpose listed in s 37(1)(d) is not said by either party to be relevant.  No question arises about the promotion of treatment or rehabilitation of the plaintiff by reference to the terms of the impugned condition.  It can be put to one side.  26The central issue for determination is whether it can be said that the impugned condition is imposed for, and is capable of, fulfilling any one or more of the first three listed purposes.  27Before further considering that issue, it is appropriate to notice part of the Second Reading Speech of the Honourable Frank Walker MLA, the then Attorney-General, when on 14 December 1978, he said that the Bill which became the Bail Act, was being introduced as a result of a decision to "" codify the law as to bail "".  28He said (at page 2016) that:  ""The basic object of setting bail is to ensure that an unconvicted accused person appears in court in respect of the offence for which bail is being considered.  As such, it is the primary and most important factor to be considered in any bail application.""  29The Attorney-General noted that non-compliance with bail conditions was dealt with in Part 7 of the Bill.  He said:  ""Part VII is concerned with non-compliance with undertakings and conditions.  In order to ensure that accused persons released on non-financial bail conditions will appear and that legitimate community interests are otherwise protected, the Bill contains a number of important provisions in clauses 50 to 53.""  30He concludes the Second Reading Speech with the following remarks:  ""These bail provisions are important measures which will substantially improve the administration of criminal justice in New South Wales.  They attempt to strike the necessary delicate balance between the right of an unconvicted accused person to be at liberty while awaiting determination of the charge on the one hand, and the protection and welfare of the community on the other...  Although it is perfectly true that the community must be protected against dangerous offenders, one must not lose sight of the circumstances, first that when bail is being considered, one is confronted with an alleged crime and an unconvicted accused person, and second, the liberty of the subject is one of the most fundamental and treasured concepts in our society.""  Is the Impugned Condition authorised by the Bail Act?  31It is convenient to restate here two matters:  (a)It is accepted by both parties that it is a valid condition of bail to restrict a person from consuming any alcohol;  (b)The impugned condition is restricted to the following words:  ""...and is to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer.""  32In this and many like cases, as the consumption of alcohol has been directly connected with the commission of the offences with which the plaintiff was charged, the imposition of a ban on the consumption of alcohol can be said to fulfil the purpose of the protection and welfare of either the specially affected person or the community.  33Considering the three purposes, it is to be observed that they have been expressed separately.  It is appropriate therefore, to give them separate consideration and meaning.  A condition can fulfil more than one purpose, but each purpose should be understood as being addressed to different circumstances.  34In submission, the second defendant contended that the purpose of the impugned condition was two-fold, namely:  (a)to provide a ready means for the detection of the breach of the condition of bail requiring the plaintiff to refrain from consuming any alcohol; and  (b)to provide a deterrent to the plaintiff so as to ensure that he complied with the bail condition, by refraining from drinking alcohol.  35A question arises as to whether either or both of these purposes fall within any of the three purposes contemplated by s 37.  Law Enforcement  36I accept that the purpose of "" promoting effective law enforcement "" is a concept that is rather more elastic than concise, rather more ambulatory than fixed and generally protean like.  In addition to the well known concept of preventing the commission of crime and the arrest of offenders, or else those suspected of committing crimes, it would also include ensuring that a person attends court when required and preventing the person from fleeing the jurisdiction, thereby attempting to avoid prosecution and sentence.  It may also include conditions of bail, such as designated residence and compliance with supervision by a nominated person, because such conditions are designed to achieve these ends, and these ends promote law enforcement.  37I observe that the Bail Act does not make a breach of a condition of bail an offence except in one clearly defined circumstance.  A person may be arrested for breaching a condition of bail and be brought before a court, but they are then to be dealt with by being released on original bail or by the original bail being revoked: s 50 of the Bail Act .  It is only an offence if a person fails to appear, and then only without reasonable excuse: s 51 of the Bail Act .  38In the context of the impugned condition, which is one as to the conduct of an individual whilst on bail, the mechanism envisaged by the Bail Act is that the person seeking bail ""... enter[s] into an agreement to observe specified requirements as to his or her conduct while at liberty on bail ... "": s 36(2)(a) Bail Act .  39The agreement does not create any obligation which is enforced by the criminal law.  A breach of it is addressed by a revocation of bail, or else a continuation of bail.  No question arises, at least directly, as to the enforcement of any specific law or the law generally.  40A condition which is designed to enable a more ready proof of a breach of the agreement, or else to deter a breach of this agreement does not either directly or indirectly address any issue of law enforcement.  41In those circumstances, it does not seem to me that either of the two purposes stated by the second defendant to justify the impugned condition fall within the purpose of "" promoting effective law enforcement "": s 37(1)(a) Bail Act .  Protection and Welfare  42A condition that restricts the consumption of alcohol can fulfil either of the legislated purposes dealing with the protection and welfare of either a specially affected person or of the community generally.  43The context in which it is necessary to consider these purposes is that although a person is charged with the commission of a criminal offence, it is likely that they will appear when required and so they should not remain in custody pending their next court appearance, but rather should be released on bail.  44A determination then needs to be made as to whether a particular specially affected person may need protection or else whether the community generally is in need of protection, and hence the person's bail ought be subject to a conduct requirement.  45It seems to me that the concept of protection as it is used in s 37, is protection from the conduct which involves the commission of further offences, or else which may involve a threat, a potential threat to the physical and mental well-being of an identified individual, but which may fall short of the commission of an offence.  46The impugned condition cannot fulfil these objectives.  Nor could a condition such as an obligation to wear a specified type or colour of clothing that would enable ready detection of, or deterrence from breach of bail conditions fall within such a purpose.  47Likewise, the impugned condition, the purpose of which is to deter a breach of a condition of bail, or else to make the detection of a breach more readily established, does not fall within either of those purposes.  48For those reasons, I am not satisfied that that impugned condition is one which is permitted by s 37 as it does not comply with any of the purposes dictated by the legislation.  Further Difficulties with the Impugned Condition  49There are three further reasons why I am satisfied that the condition is unlawful.  50Part 7 of the Bail Act deals with non-compliance with undertakings and conditions.  As I have identified earlier, where a person is in breach of a condition of bail, the Bail Act provides that they may be arrested, their original bail revoked or else they may be released on their original bail.  If their original bail is revoked then new bail can be set.  51It is quite clear that the terms of s 50 are intended by the Legislature to deal with the course of action that would follow in the event of a breach of an undertaking or agreement that has been entered into.  The method by which the Bail Act achieves its intention is to require an individual to enter into an agreement, with or without conditions to comply with the bail undertaking.  52The penalty envisaged by a failure to comply with the bail agreement, or any condition of it, is that the person is brought before the Court and the question of bail is reconsidered, as would be the question of the imposition of any conditions.  In other words, the Legislature places the responsibility of compliance with the bail undertaking on the individual, with the sanction that if they do not comply, the Court would reconsider the question of bail and any conditions.  The ultimate sanction would be that the person has their liberty on bail terminated and they are remanded in custody.  53Section 50, which is contained within Part 7 of the Bail Act , does not contemplate the imposition of any deterrent upon a person subject to the bail undertaking or agreement other than that undertaking and the consequences of breach of that undertaking or any condition contemplated by s 50.  54It is not for the courts to fill a void left by the legislation and to impose a condition that deters a person from breaching their bail agreement.  As I have said, the Bail Act contemplates that the agreement will be adhered to or else the release of the person on bail will be put in jeopardy.  55The second reason which leads me to conclude that the impugned condition is unlawful, is that the terms of it are not capable of any enforcement because they are vague and, in a legal sense, meaningless.  56Central to the impugned condition, is the concept of a ""breath test"".  But what is meant by the phrase a breath test?  The phrase is not one known to the common law.  It is only to be found in a defined way in a number of different statutes, none of which have any application in the context of the Bail Act .  57It seems to me that those statutes fall within readily identifiable categories:  (a)those which affect the safety of the public, namely to test the alcohol consumption of:  (i)drivers of motor vehicles: Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999;  (ii)rail safety staff; Rail Safety (Drug and Alcohol Testing) Regulation 2008 ;  (iii)operators of marine craft: Marine Safety Act 1998;  (iv)drivers of passenger transport: Passenger Transport (Drug and Alcohol Testing) Regulation 2010; and  (b)those which affect the fitness for work of certain employees, namely:  (i)juvenile detention centre staff: Children (Detention Centres) Act 1987, Children (Detention Centres) Regulation 2010;  (ii)correctional centre staff: Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999, Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008; and  (iii)police officers: Police Act 1990, Police Regulation 2008.  58The term ""breath test"" is defined in each of these pieces of legislation.  There is considerable similarity, although not precise identity, between these statutory definitions.  Common to the statutory definitions is a definition of the device being used.  The device is typically defined by reference to:  ""... a type approved by the Governor for the conduct of breath tests under the Road Transport (Safety and Management) Act "".  59In that particular legislation, the breath test is defined as one involving the use of a device which is of "" ... a type approved by the Governor by order published in the Gazette"" .  In other legislation, the device is defined as including a device of a type ""... that complies with the requirements of AS 3547 - 1997, Breath alcohol testing devices for personal use ... "".  60In these various pieces of legislation, the test is used for the detection, by way of a preliminary analysis at least, of the presence of alcohol in the blood of an individual.  However, the breath test alone in each of these statutes is insufficient to determine that question with any finality or specificity.  In order to determine the question of the actual amount of alcohol in a person's blood, generally the procedure required is that the person to whom a breath test has been administered is obliged to undertake a breath analysis test, administered by the use of a different device, often in a different location.  Again, this is a statutorily defined test that includes provision for the certification of types of devices and operators, in order to comply with the statute.  61Of particular importance, where this is necessary for the purpose of the statute, the statutes also include provisions that give effect to the readings of the breath analysis machine and certificates that constitute admissible evidence and proof of the relevant reading.  The detail of these statutory provisions is unnecessary to be recounted here, but such provisions as are typical can be found in Part 2, Division 7 of the Road Transport (Safety and Management) Act .  62It seems to me that without any form of definition, the words ""breath test"" as they are contained in the impugned condition, are meaningless.  The test that can be undertaken by a police officer is not defined by the impugned condition itself, nor is it defined by reference to any piece of legislation.  The concept is at large and could mean many different things to different people.  63There is a further final reason that the impugned condition is not valid.  It is more onerous than required for the plaintiff, and thereby contrary to s 37(2) of the Bail Act .  64The impugned condition does not call for any of the following:  (a)the police officer making the request to have a reasonable suspicion that the person has consumed alcohol;  (b)the specification of the location for, or the method of testing to which a person may be subject;  (c)the number of times in any one hour or on one day that a person can be requested to undergo a breath test;  (d)any connection between the result of a breath test and proof of the consumption of alcohol by the person subject to the bail condition.  65The second defendant accepted that upon a proper interpretation of the impugned condition, an individual could be tested every 15 minutes for the entirety of a day.  While this is an example that may be unlikely to be replicated in practice, it serves to demonstrate the onerous nature of the impugned condition, because there is no additional qualification or restriction contained within it which address any of the matters noted in the preceding paragraph.  66As well, arguably, the police requesting the person to undergo a breath test are not obliged to administer the test at the time when, and at the location where, the request is made, but rather are able to ask the person to whom they wish to administer the breath test to go to a different location, perhaps a police station, where the test would be administered.  Yet there is no distance or location fixed by way of any words in the impugned condition, which would limit the police officer making the request.  67There is nothing in the impugned condition that would prevent a police officer requesting an individual to attend at a police station which is some kilometres from where that individual lives, in order to undergo the test.  An individual without means of transport required to attend for the purpose specified, may be unable to do so, but may yet be in breach of the bail agreement, if they fail to comply with such a request.  68The example in the preceding three paragraphs may be highly unlikely to occur in everyday practice.  And, it may be open to a person who does not comply with a request of the kind identified to contend that there has not been any breach of the impugned condition either, because the request was an unreasonable one, or else that they used their best endeavours to comply with the request.  But this serves only to highlight that the impugned condition as stated:  (a)is far too broad, and  (b)is far more onerous than could possibly be required in the circumstances prevailing in the matter before Magistrate Dunlevy.  69The impugned condition as framed, because of the reasons to which I have just referred is more onerous than the circumstances required and does not accord with the requirements of the Bail Act .  Conclusion  70The impugned condition is unlawful and appropriate relief ought be granted.  Orders  (1)The Court declares that insofar as the grant of conditional bail to the plaintiff required him to enter into an agreement in accordance with the Bail Act 1978 to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer, such obligation is unlawful.  (2)The Court orders that insofar as, and to the extent that, the grant of conditional bail obliges the plaintiff to enter into an agreement in accordance with the Bail Act 1978, to submit to a breath test when requested by a police officer, the grant of conditional bail is quashed.  (3)The Court orders that the second defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings.  **********

		13 February 2012",2012-02-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2416208,R v Millwood [2012] NSWCCA 2,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ: For the reasons given by Simpson J, I agree that the appeal should be dismissed. 

2SIMPSON J: Pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Director of Public Prosecutions (""the DPP"") appeals against the asserted inadequacy of sentences imposed upon the respondent in District Court at Lismore, following his pleas of guilty to one count of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death, and one count of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. Both offences were committed in the early hours of 18 July 2010 as part of the same event. In each count the single circumstance of aggravation alleged in the indictment was that the respondent's ability to drive was very substantially impaired by the fact that he was under the influence of a combination of drugs (they being alcohol and cannabis): see Crimes Act 1900 s 52A(7). 

3Pursuant to s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act , the first count carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. Pursuant to s 52A(4) the second count carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 11 years. 

4On the first count, Black DCJ sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 4 years, commencing on 8 September 2011, and expiring on 7 September 2015, with a non-parole period of 3 years, expiring on 7 September 2014. On the second count he sentenced the respondent to imprisonment for 2 years, commencing on 7 September 2014 (it should have been 8 September 2014), and therefore wholly accumulated upon the non-parole period of the previously-imposed sentence, expiring on 6 September 2016 (it should have been 7 September), with a non-parole period of 9 months, expiring on 6 (7) June 2015. 

5His Honour imposed successive licence disqualifications of 4 years and 2 years, expiring on 16 July 2016. 

6Also before the court was a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 on which were listed four ""back up"" charges, two of which were ultimately withdrawn and dismissed. The remaining two (of driving whilst there was present in the respondent's blood the prescribed concentration of alcohol, and failing to comply with high performance vehicle restriction) resulted in, respectively, a fixed term of imprisonment for 9 months, commencing on 8 September 2011 and expiring on 7 June 2012 (and therefore wholly subsumed in the two previously-imposed sentences) and a further disqualification of 12 months, from 18 July 2010 to 17 July 2011, (and therefore also wholly subsumed). 

7The aggregate term of imprisonment is 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months. The DPP complains that that sentence is manifestly inadequate. 

The facts 

8The facts are undoubtedly very serious indeed. They were put before the court by way of an agreed statement. 

9On the day before the offences, 17 July 2010, the respondent attended a memorial service marking the first anniversary of the death of a friend. He then attended a hotel, from which he was, at 1.45 am the following day, removed because of intoxication and aggressive behaviour. At 3.15 am, he was driving a turbocharged Volvo station wagon on a road in Byron Bay. He stopped to pick up two hitchhikers, Dylan Garft and Ben Donohoe. Ben Donohoe sat in the rear seat behind the respondent. Dylan Garft sat in the front passenger seat. The respondent told the two passengers to ""buckle up"" and pressed his foot on the accelerator. The speed limit on that part of the road was 50 kph, but the respondent travelled at a speed well in excess of that. Mr Garft formed the view that the respondent was showing off. The acceleration was such that Mr Garft felt himself being pushed back in the passenger seat. 

10The respondent approached a moderate left bend in the roadway and crossed to the incorrect side of the road, in the path of a Commodore travelling in the opposite direction. The driver of the Commodore swerved to avoid collision with the respondent; the respondent also swerved and began to rotate on the roadway. His vehicle left the roadway and collided heavily with a tree. The area was residential. The impact of the vehicle was of sufficient severity to dislodge the engine, and throw it a considerable distance, into the middle of an intersection, where it narrowly missed a taxi travelling on the roadway. The force also caused the right wheel of the Volvo to break off and travel a distance of 80 metres. These events give some idea of the force of the impact, and therefore the speed at which the vehicle was travelling. 

11Ben Donohoe was thrown through the back window of the Volvo. He sustained multiple injuries which were fatal. 

12Dylan Garft sustained an injury to his eye (which subsequently required surgery), fractured ribs, pneumothorax, lung contusions, a fracture of the left scapula and a fracture of the right ankle. 

13The respondent also suffered fractures to his neck and ribs. 

14Blood testing (at some later time) disclosed a blood alcohol reading of 0.132 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood (which, it was agreed, would, at the time of collision, have been not less than 0.150 mg and not more than 0.176 mg, with a most likely level of 0.158 mg). There were also present in the respondent's blood various other drugs, ecstasy, cannabis and diazepam. At the time, the respondent's capacity to drive was very substantially impaired. So much is acknowledged by the respondent's pleas of guilty to the counts on the indictment. 

15The respondent was the holder of a provisional driving licence. He was therefore not permitted to drive with any concentration of alcohol in his bloodstream at all. Moreover, he was not permitted to drive high performance vehicles such as the turbocharged station wagon. 

16The respondent told ambulance officers at the scene that he had not been in the vehicle. He was subsequently interviewed, and agreed that he had been driving, and had been travelling at about 90 kph at the time of the collision. This was consistent with expert evidence, which was that the minimum speed of the vehicle would have been 91 kph, and the maximum 109 kph. 

The proceedings on sentence 

17Before the court, beside the statement of facts, was a ""Collision Reconstruction and Analysis Report"" with photographs both of the vehicle and the location of the collision. There was also a statement of facts of a previous offence committed by the respondent, on 30 November 2003, when he was found, by a random breath test unit, to have been driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.120 gm per 100 ml. The respondent hand, at that time, never held a driving licence. Three passengers were in the vehicle. 

18Also in evidence were a Pre-Sentence Report, some medical evidence concerning the respondent, and a number of reports and testimonials. A significant document was a letter from the respondent's sister, Letechia Lucas. Dylan Garft and Ms Yvonne Donohoe (Ben Donohoe's mother) read Victim Impact Statements to the court. Mr Garft described both the physical and emotional effects upon him. He said that the accident had left him ""emotionally ruined""; he suffers nightmares of the crash, and finds it very difficult to travel in a car, which makes him anxious and nervous. He has feelings of guilt because he survived and his friend did not. He finds media reports of events relating to speed, drink driving or crashes confronting and difficult to cope with. His normal life has been ""totally overwhelmed"". He said that all of his symptoms left him with ""chronic emotional dis-regulation"". 

19He also said that it had been ""financially straining"", had impeded him in his career goals, and affected his relationships. 

20Ms Donohoe's statement was lengthy, extending to over six pages of typescript. It is impossible to read it without a consciousness of the severity of the repercussions of the respondent's behaviour. 

21Although the respondent did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings, he read a statement to the court. It is as follows: 

""To the families that I've hurt so badly: I don't know how to start a letter to the families that I am the cause of their son to pass away; one to be hospitalised. I feel sorry every day for my actions and now I have to pay the price. I just hope you can get some kind of relief from this letter and I hope you know that I didn't mean to hurt anyone let alone kill someone that night. 

I just think every day why couldn't I keep driving at not pick anyone up but it all comes back to I shouldn't have been drink driving in the first place. It is the worst choice I have ever made in my life. If I make it out of gaol I want youse to know I will move away from Byron Bay so you don't have see my face and be reminded of what happened that night. 

If there is anything else I can do to help please let me know. 

Yours sincerely with great remorse 

Shane Millwood"" 

22Both the Crown Prosecutor and the respondent's legal representative put detailed and carefully considered submissions to the sentencing judge. The Crown Prosecutor expressly submitted that the offences were: 

""very substantially above the mid-range of objective seriousness, indeed above what might be regarded as the mid-point between the mid-range and the worst category.:."" 

The respondent's personal circumstances 

23Evidence of the respondent's personal circumstances was provided in the form of the reports which I have already mentioned. He was born in March 1984 and was 26 years of age at the time of the offences. He had some criminal record, to which I will come, including the previous drink driving offence mentioned above. 

24The Pre-Sentence Report shows that he had a severely dysfunctional childhood. He was the third of four siblings; his mother and stepfather were heroin addicts who neglected the family. His stepfather was physically abusive and often intolerant of the children's needs. At the age of 16 the respondent witnessed the death of his mother from a heroin overdose, having failed in attempts to resuscitate her. He did not receive any counselling following this traumatic event. His sister's letter expanded on the circumstances of his childhood and youth, and his consequent behaviour. She also spoke of the respondent's deep regret for what he had done. 

25Unsurprisingly, given the circumstances of his family life, his behaviour degenerated from an early age, and he began to use alcohol as well as a variety of illicit drugs. 

26He has convictions for offensive behaviour and associated offences, shoplifting, motor vehicle offences (driving unregistered and uninsured motor vehicles, driving without a licence, and the drink driving offence in 2003), assault (at least eight counts), and damage to property. In April 2006, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 8 months, but the sentence was, pursuant to s 12 of the Sentencing Procedure Act , suspended. In October 2006, in respect of offences of assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 8 months. 

27The respondent entered a plea of guilty to the charges on 8 June 2011, and was then first taken into custody. On the same day, in respect of offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and trespass with intent to commit an indictable offence, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months, commencing on that date. No details of those offences were provided. 

28The sentencing judge had available to him a brief psychological report dated 14 January 2011. The psychologist had begun treatment of the respondent on 3 January, but had had only one consultation. On the basis of that consultation, he considered the respondent to be showing symptoms of anxiety, depression, guilt and trauma, much of it directly related to the offences. He also expressed the view that the respondent: 

""... had and continues to have unresolved emotional issues that were existent prior to the 18 th of August."" 

He considered that the events had affected the respondent deeply. He proposed to continue treatment. 

29There was also a report of a ""credentialed mental health nurse"", dated 25 May 2011, saying, inter alia , that because the respondent's bail conditions required him to live in the Byron Bay area, he had become reclusive, leading to ""a significant level of depression and anxiety"", and predicting ""long-term psychological distress."" He said that: 

""Since the accident, [the respondent] has lived in fear and under siege in a hostile environment, where he has attracted a high level of notoriety, including being assaulted and allegedly received death threats."" 

There was no direct evidence to substantiate these assertions. There was also evidence of the physical consequences of his injuries. 

30The respondent had also sought assistance from a local community health centre in October 2010. A youth drug and alcohol counsellor reported that he was ""working hard to get on with his life"", not drinking alcohol, and taking only prescription medication. 

The Remarks on Sentence 

31The Remarks on Sentence are very brief. His Honour recounted the facts of the offences, noting the expert evidence concerning the blood alcohol reading and the extrapolation to the higher figure that would have been the case at the time of the collision. His Honour said: 

""... and there were also significant traces of other illegal substances. The indictment I note limits itself to cannabis and I will limit myself to that in considering this matter."" 

That was a reference to the specific circumstances of aggravation alleged in the indictment, which charged that the respondent drove in a manner dangerous: 

"" ... when his ability to drive was very substantially impaired by the fact that he was under the influence of a combination of drugs, namely alcohol and cannabis ..."" 

Precisely what his Honour meant by the observation is not clear. Since it featured in the submissions advanced on behalf of the DPP on the appeal, it will have to be considered below. 

32By way of analysis of the objective gravity of the offences, his Honour said only this: 

""The Crown describes the situation here as a serious abandonment of responsibility. According to the authorities as I read them, that is another way of saying that the moral culpability of the offender was high. The Crown correctly refers to the fact that he was a P plate driver and should not have been drinking at all. It is a 50 kilometre speed limit and the material shows that the speed of the impact was nearly double the speed limit and there is reference in the material possibly to showing off. The facts on their own are serious enough and the case of White [sic - R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343, 55 NSWLR 252] gives significant guidance where moral culpability is high. The position here is that there are two offences, one death and one grievous bodily harm, there has to be in my view an overlapping of sentencing for that and in considering the appropriate sentence as I have already said I bear in mind the age of the offender."" 

33He proceeded to make equally brief mention of the evidence of the respondent's personal circumstances. 

34His Honour made reference to the Victim Impact Statements, particularly that of Ms Donohoe, and also the letter written by the respondent's sister. He determined that, in recognition of the pleas of guilty, and in accordance with the principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, he would reduce the sentences imposed by ""between 15 and 20%"". In this context he noted that, although the pleas were entered almost 12 months after the offences, it had been known before then that the respondent would plead guilty, and he said: 

""The Crown has indicated that they would concede 20% but I must say the circumstances of this accident, if I can call it that, mean that there was not much chance of avoiding conviction of this. I do give credit for the plea but it is more somewhere between 15 and 20% the credit that I give."" 

35He considered whether he should find, pursuant to s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, that there were special circumstances justifying departure from the proportions there stated between the non-parole period and the head sentence, but concluded that there were not. It can be seen that the first sentence imposed does conform with those proportions; the second does not, but that is clearly in order to restore the statutory proportions in the overall sentence, and that was achieved. 

36The judge noted the sentences of 6 months imposed on 8 June 2011 (expiring 7 December 2011). It is those sentences that explain the selection of commencement date of the current sentences; his Honour accumulated upon those sentences, by 3 months, the first of the sentences he imposed. 

The grounds of appeal 

37The DPP pleads four grounds of appeal. They are formulated as follows: 

""1. The sentencing judge failed to adequately assess the objective criminality of the offences leading to the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences. 

2. The sentencing judge failed to adequately assess the moral culpability of the respondent leading to the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences. 

3. The sentencing judge failed to have regard to the objectives of sentencing and in particular to considerations of deterrence leading to the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences. 

4. The sentencing judge gave excessive weight to the respondent's subjective case leading to the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences."" 

38Both parties argued grounds 1 and 2 together. I will deal with them in the same way. 

Ground 1: Objective Criminality 
Ground 2: Moral culpability 

39In written submissions filed behalf of the Crown it was (correctly) pointed out that: 

""Assessment of and the attribution of due weight to the objective gravity of an offence is fundamental to the sentencing process: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357; R v Khoury [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [71]."" 

40The submission went on to characterise the sentencing judge's consideration of the facts as ""cursory and incomplete"", involving: 

""... no meaningful analysis of how those matters affected the assessment of objective seriousness or the respondent's moral culpability ..."" 

In oral submissions it was said that the brevity of the Remarks on Sentence was indicative of a failure to give adequate reasons for the sentence imposed. 

41It was argued that, having regard to ""the multitude of serious aggravating factors"", it was necessary that his Honour accurately identify both the objective seriousness of the offences and the level of moral culpability of the respondent. Counsel for the DPP argued that it was ""difficult to imagine a more serious example of aggravated dangerous driving"". She pointed to: 


the level to which the respondent was affected by drugs and alcohol; 
that he was driving a high performance vehicle in breach of his licence restriction; 
that, knowing his level of intoxication, he picked up two hitchhikers, who were unaware of his ingestion of alcohol and drugs and his inexperience as a driver; 
that, within 500 metres, in a residential area, he accelerated to almost twice the legal speed; and 
that he was driving on the wrong side of the road and ""showing off"". Features that place the offences in the highest category of objective criminality include the number of victims, and the extent of their injuries. 

42The Crown also identified, separately, features of the offences relevant to the high level of moral culpability. These were: 

the level of alcohol intoxication; 
the level of multiple drug consumption; 
the excessive speed at which the respondent was travelling; 
the erratic driving prior to impact; 
the showing off; 
that the respondent was driving a high performance vehicle which he was licensed to drive; 
the fact that Mr Donohoe was not wearing a seat belt (see R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300; R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229); 
the fact that the respondent ""deliberately"" put the two victims in the gravest danger by picking them up when they were hitchhiking, where he knew of the amount of drugs and alcohol he had consumed and that he was a provisional licence driver, circumstances of which the two victims were ignorant. 

43By way of response, senior counsel for the respondent argued that there was no substance in either of these grounds. He pointed out, correctly, that his Honour succinctly and accurately recited the key facts (drawing on the agreed statement) and that he did make reference, although brief, to each of the matters mentioned by the Crown. He took issue with the proposition (in reliance on Berg and AB ) that the fact that Mr Donohoe was not wearing a seat belt was a highly aggravating feature. 

44In Whyte , to which the sentencing judge made brief reference, this Court, constituted by a bench of five, including the then Chief Justice and the President of the Court of Appeal, promulgated guideline sentences applicable to offences against s 52A. 

45At [229 -231] the following appears in the judgment of Spigelman CJ: 

229. The guideline for offences against s52A(1) and (3) for the typical case identified above should be: 

'Where the offender's moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate.' 

230 In the case of a low level of moral culpability, a lower sentence will, of course, be appropriate. 

231 In the case of the aggravated version of each offence under s52A [of the Crimes Act 1900], an appropriate increment to reflect the higher maximum penalty, and what will generally be a higher level of moral culpability, is required. Other factors, such as the number of victims, will also require an appropriate increment."" 

46Section 52A(1) creates an offence of dangerous driving causing death, where the driver of a vehicle was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug, or driving at a speed or in a manner dangerous to others. It prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. Section 52A(3) creates an equivalent offence, where grievous bodily harm is occasioned. It prescribes a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years. 

47Section 52A(2) and s 52A(4) provide for the aggravated versions of these offences, with the increased maximum penalties I have set out above (14 years and 11 years respectively). Circumstances that take the offences into the aggravated category are set out in subs (7) and are: 

""(a) the prescribed concentration of alcohol was present in the [driver's] breath or blood, 

(b) the [driver] was driving the vehicle ... at a speed that exceeded, by more than 45 kilometres per hour, the speed limited ... applicable ...; 

(c) the [driver] was driving the vehicle to escape pursuit by a police officer; 

(d) the [driver's] ability to drive was substantially impaired by the fact that [the driver] was under the influence of a drug (other than intoxicating liquor) or a combination of drugs (whether or not intoxicating liquor was part of that combination."" 

(The only aggravating circumstance pleaded in the indictment was that provided for by subs (7)(d).) 

48The ""typical case"" mentioned in [229] of the judgment of Spigelman CJ was described in [204] as having the following features: 

(i) Young offender. 
(ii) Of good character with no or limited prior convictions. 
(iii) Death or permanent injury to a single person. 
(iv) The victim is a stranger. 
(v) No or limited injury to the driver or the driver's intimates. 
(vi) Genuine remorse. 
(vii) Plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value."" 

49The Chief Justice also identified a series of aggravating factors relevant to the assessment of objective gravity of an offence against s 52A. ""Aggravating features"" nominated in this list are to be distinguished from those ""circumstances of aggravation"" in subs (7) which take an offence of dangerous driving either occasioning death, or occasioning grievous bodily harm, into a higher penalty scheme: The aggravating features specified in Whyte (at [216], most of which are adopted from R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 231 B-C) are: 

""(i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted. 
(ii) Number of people put at risk. 
(iii) Degree of speed. 
(iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse. 
(v) Erratic [or aggressive] driving. 
(vi) Competitive driving or showing off. 
(vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk. 
(viii) Ignoring of warnings. 
(ix) Escaping police pursuit. 
(x) Degree of sleep deprivation. 
(xi) Failing to stop."" 

These features, if present, aggravate the offence, whether it is of the unaggravated or aggravated form as provided in s 52A. 

50A number of them are here applicable. Two people were immediately put at risk; but others on the roadway (for example the driver of and any passengers, in the Commodore) were put at risk, as was the driver of, and any passengers in, the taxi (but in respect of most dangerous driving charges the possibility of the presence of other road users may be assumed); the speed at which the respondent was travelling was almost double the prescribed speed limit for the area; the driving was erratic and competitive, or ""showing off"". In my opinion, the extent and nature of the injuries inflicted is not applicable; death is an integral element of the offence of which Mr Donohoe was the victim, and, while it could not be said that the injuries to Mr Garft were minor, nor were they in the realm of gravity sometimes seen in such cases. The length of the journey from the hotel prior to the respondent picking up Mr Garft and Mr Donohoe is not apparent from the materials; the length of the journey during which Mr Donohoe and Mr Garft (as passengers) were put at risk was relatively short. But that was because the nature of the driving was such that the journey came to an abrupt and tragic end. 

51As was pointed out by senior counsel for the respondent, the focus of each of these grounds is asserted failure adequately ""to assess"" objective criminality and moral culpability. The criticism is of the extent to which his Honour's reasoning to the sentences he imposed explains those sentences. 

52I accept that the Remarks are economical. But, when pressed, counsel for the DPP was unable to identify any matter of objective criminality that was omitted. In the passage extracted, the judge mentioned: 

that the respondent was driving on a provisional licence and was permitted no level of blood alcohol; 
that the speed limit applicable was 50 kilometres per hour; 
that the respondent was travelling at almost double that speed; 
that the respondent was ""possibly showing off"". 

In other parts of the Remarks, he noted the presence of the ""other illegal substances"" in the respondent's bloodstream. 

The comment by the judge that he would ""limit [himself]"" to cannabis in considering the drug ingestion by the respondent brought particular criticism on behalf of the DPP. It was pointed out that diazepam and ecstasy were also present, and that this fact aggravated the offences even if not specified in the indictment. 

53There was no evidence as to the nature of diazepam; counsel described it as ""a sleeping tablet"" and submitted that it was unlawful to drive having ingested that drug. In the absence of any identified statutory authority for that proposition, I would reject it. It is, of course, true that ecstasy is a prohibited drug, but, while the statement of facts identified the quantity present, there is no explanation, in non-scientific terms, of what that quantity signifies, and no evidence as to what effect it might have had, alone or in combination with alcohol and ecstasy, on the respondent's driving capacity. 

54I accept, however, that there was no mention that the respondent was driving a high performance vehicle in breach of his licence restrictions and no mention of his previous conviction for drink driving. These are not insignificant matters. 

55I am unable to identify in the Remarks any undue emphasis on the respondent's personal circumstances. They were, in fact, given equally brief treatment. Some emphasis was placed by counsel for the DPP on the failure to take into account ""the number of victims"". That is erroneous. The reference in Whyte is to ""number of people put at risk."" Each of these offences involved a single victim; to have taken into account, on one offence, that there was a second victim, in circumstances where that second victim was the subject of a separate charge, would have involved serious error. 

56Nevertheless, it is apparent that this was a case in which both the objective gravity, and moral culpability, were very high, such as to call for sentences in excess, and well in excess, of those the subject of the guidelines in Whyte . 

57Of course, guideline judgments are precisely that: guidelines. They do not bind sentencing judges to any greater degree than as a guide. 

58In my opinion, it is clear that, in respect of the more serious charge, by imposing a head sentence of imprisonment for 4 years (against the guideline of 3 years) his Honour has taken into account both the fact that this was an aggravated offence, and the other circumstances of aggravation that are applicable. The sentence imposed is, in fact, 33% longer than that promulgated in Jurisic . 

59That is not the case in respect of the offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, which is precisely in alignment with the sentence promulgated in the guideline judgment, but with no apparent allowance for the fact that it was the aggravated form of the offence, or for the other aggravating features. 

60However, that has to be seen in the light of the total accumulation, and the resulting totality. When that is factored into the debate, I am not persuaded that inadequate attention was paid to objective criminality or to moral culpability. 

61A relevant circumstance in respect of moral culpability lies in the respondent's personal circumstances, which are plainly such as to invite some allowance to be made. I deal with this in more detail below. 

62Although the offences were indeed very serious, and notwithstanding the omission of mention of two circumstances relevant to objective gravity, I am not persuaded that the overall sentence was manifestly inadequate. It would have been open to the judge to have imposed a lengthier term, particularly in respect of the second offence, but that would have called for a degree of accumulation that would have resulted in an aggregate sentence much the same as that which was imposed. 

63I would reject Grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal. 

Ground 3: Objectives of sentencing/deterrence 

64Complaint was made on behalf of the DPP that the sentencing judge made no reference to the objectives of sentencing or to how the sentence imposed achieved those objectives. It was submitted that the omission to refer to these matters is demonstrative of error. 

65I do not accept that submission. There is no call for sentencing judges to recite, in every sentencing decision, the objectives of sentencing. Sentencing is a daily task undertaken in the District Court and the objectives are plainly well known to those who perform that function. 

66Particular complaint was made that his Honour failed to refer at all to the important sentencing considerations of general and specific deterrence. That is, I accept, an omission. It is, however, overcome by the reference to the guidance given by Whyte , and the sentences there promulgated, which have built into them a general and specific deterrence component. 

67I would reject this ground of appeal. 

Ground 4: ""Subjective case"" 

68The argument advanced under this ground was that a large proportion of the Remarks on Sentence was devoted to the respondent's personal circumstances. The submission was made that: 

"" ... it is evident that his Honour was greatly affected by the respondent's statement to the court, and his tragic and dysfunctional upbringing."" 

The submission went on: 

"" ... there is little in the circumstances of the respondent that assist him by way of mitigation. He is not young, being 27 years old at the time of sentencing. He has a lengthy criminal history ... the victims were strangers to him. His plea of guilty was not entered at the earliest opportunity."" 

69I would reject the proposition contained in the first sentence. I am not prepared to accept that an offender who has the start in life that the respondent had bears equal moral responsibility with one who has had what might be termed a ""normal"" or ""advantaged"" upbringing. Common sense and common humanity dictate that such a person will have fewer emotional resources to guide his (or her) behavioural decisions. I should not be taken as implying that such a person bears no moral responsibility; but I consider that the DPP's submission significantly underestimates the impact of a dysfunctional childhood. Indeed, it sits uneasily with the immediately preceding acknowledgement that his upbringing had been ""tragic and dysfunctional"". That his background is a relevant consideration affording some (although limited) mitigation is entirely consistent with the approach taken by Wood J (as he then was) in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58, a decision which has repeatedly been followed in this Court. If that were not so, there would be no purpose in sentencing courts receiving, as they invariably do, evidence concerning the personal background of offenders. 

70It was acknowledged on behalf of the DPP that the respondent suffered injury himself and that this is a relevant sentencing consideration. 

71The timing of the plea of guilty, in this case, is of no assistance; it is apparent that the respondent had signalled his intention of pleading guilty at an early stage, sufficient for the Crown Prosecutor at sentencing to accept that a reduction of 20% in sentence would be appropriate. 

72Moreover, while the complaint is that the sentencing judge devoted ""a large proportion"" of his Remarks to the respondent's personal circumstances, complaint was also made about the paucity of the remarks devoted to analysis of the objective circumstances. In fact, a fair reading of the Remarks on Sentence shows that both aspects of the sentencing task were treated with the same, considerable, economy. The Remarks do not suggest to me that undue attention was given to personal circumstances as distinct from objective gravity. 

73I would reject this ground of appeal. 

74I note also that, as was pointed out on behalf of the respondent, the reduction allowed by reason of the plea of guilty, stated as ""15 - 20%"" appears to have been influenced, at least in part, by the strength of the Crown case. While the strength of the Crown case might be relevant to whether a plea of guilty is indicative of remorse, it is not relevant to the utilitarian value of the plea, which is the determinant for the identified reductions. It may be that, by taking this approach, the judge allowed a lesser reduction than he otherwise would have. 

75Although it is plain, in my view, that lengthier individual sentences, and a lengthier overall sentence, could have been imposed without error, I am not satisfied that the aggregate sentence in this case is manifestly inadequate. 

76I would dismiss the Crown appeal. 

77ADAMSON J: I agree with Simpson J.

2416212,R v HAZELL [2012] NSWDC 34,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: One of the first guideline judgments issued by the Court of Criminal Appeal concerned the offence of armed robbery. That guideline judgment came in response to community and appellant court concern about the level of sentences being imposed for what was a prevalent, serious and frightening offence. 

2The court heard lengthy argument, and promulgated a guideline judgment ultimately suggesting that for a standard set of circumstances, which the court outlined, a sentence of four to five years full-time custody should ordinarily result.

3I have a couple of things to say about the applicability of that judgment to the sentencing task I have before me. Firstly, that sentencing range was for a late plea, not an early one. Secondly, at the time the decision was handed down the sentencing option of an intensive correction order was not available. Thirdly, and clearly most importantly, it is a guideline rather than a straightjacket.

4Since that judgment was handed down there have been many decisions, including of the Court of Criminal Appeal itself, where sentences other than of full-time custody have been imposed for offences of armed robbery. The court has repeatedly made the point that the primary purpose of sentencing is to protect the community and, whilst that is often achieved by imposing harsh sentences designed to deter others, on occasions that objective is best achieved by promoting the rehabilitation of a particular offender. This is one such case. 

5Although the offender's conduct was seriously criminal, despite the odd setback, we have reached the position now where the offender has demonstrated his potential to rehabilitate himself. He demonstrated the likelihood that he will put his offending behaviour behind him and with the assistance of further supervision I am satisfied that this is one case where it would be inappropriate not to give great weight to Mr Hazell's rehabilitation. That is not to of course ignore the other purposes of sentencing but it is to recognise that community safety is in this case best promoted if Mr Hazell's rehabilitation can continue and be set in concrete. 

6On 28 September 2010 the offender, under the influence of drugs, went to a supermarket. He was armed with a hammer. He held it up to the lady serving behind the counter and demanded money and cigarettes. She moved away after opening the cash register. The offender lent over the counter, removed money from the register and went to leave the store. As he was leaving however a milkman came in. The offender raised the hammer to head height and swung it towards that milkman. Fortunately the milkman was holding a milk crate and he was able to lift it and block the blow from the offender.

7The offender then ran away. He was ultimately found hiding nearby. He was interviewed and incriminating material was found which clearly indicated that he had committed those offences I have just described, an offence of armed robbery and common assault. He remained in custody, bail refused, for some time, three months and twenty-seven days and there was a further one day in custody in June last year. I will get to this later, but he has also served some periods of quasi custody.

8The offender was born in July 1991, so is still a relatively young man. His parents separated when he was seven. He lived with his mother and was provided with a stable and supportive environment. He finished Year 11, did a one year horticultural course and then started work. However he has had difficulties relating to his drug use, as well as excessive alcohol consumption. He started using both at the age of fifteen. He told the author of the presentence report that they became a problem when he turned seventeen and those problems continued until he committed these offences.

9He has expressed his remorse for his behaviour and told the author of the pre-sentence report that he had consumed not only alcohol but also that he had consumed drugs. When interviewed in June last year the probation and parole officer said this:

""Mr Hazell appears to have now come to the realisation of just how stupid and foolish his offending behaviour was and deeply regrets his actions for which he takes full responsibility. He has expressed remorse for the victims of his offences and has taken positive lifestyle changes to address his offending behaviour.""

10I mentioned before that the offender had spent some time in custody. He was granted bail in the Local Court, a condition of that bail being that he attended a drug rehabilitation centre. Unfortunately there was a lapse by the offender since his admission to the Glen Centre. He consumed alcohol to excess and also committed another offence, this one of dishonesty. Ordinarily of course that would suggest that the offender's rehabilitation was unlikely but the Glen Centre was willing to have him back after a period of time and I was persuaded last year to allow him a further chance to demonstrate his rehabilitation. 

11The information presented to me today suggests that Mr Hazell has taken advantage of that opportunity and has done very well indeed. The updated pre-sentence report tendered by the Crown today speaks of Mr Hazell in what I would describe as glowing terms. It is to be noted that he was subject to a toxicology test which returned a negative result for drugs and a breath analysis test returned a negative result for alcohol. There have been no indicators of relapse to alcohol or drug use during the offender's time on bail.

12He has completed now the Glen Rehabilitation Program and appears to be making an effort towards maintaining stability in his life. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous, he has enrolled in a TAFE course and obtained employment as a furniture removalist, working, depending on what work is available, about four days a week. His employer confirms that he is a good and reliable worker. He has been living with his mother and she reports also in positive terms about Mr Hazell's attitude and his behaviour. 

13It has been the Crown's position from the outset that nothing less than full-time custody was appropriate in Mr Hazell's case. The Crown maintains that position today. It says that given the guideline judgment I could not impose a sentence of less than two years imprisonment and, given that a community service order is right out of the question, it is the Crown's position that Mr Hazell must be returned to custody to serve a further period of incarceration.

14I would not want anyone to think that I have reasoned the wrong way in this matter. I am satisfied that given Mr Hazell's behaviour during the commission of those offences, and the effects those offences are likely to have had on the victims of them, that a period of imprisonment is required. I have determined the length of that sentence after considering, not only the matters that I have thus far mentioned, but also the matter I hinted at before of the offender's pre-sentence custody.

15As well as three months and twenty-seven days in prison, he has spent some time in quasi custody as a resident at the Glen Rehabilitation Centre. He pleaded guilty at an early stage to these offences. 

16The result is that having taken into account all those matters I do not consider that if I were to date a sentence from today the sentence would be more than two years.

17Accordingly, I consider it appropriate to refer Mr Hazell for consideration as to whether he is a suitable candidate to serve his sentence by way of an intensive corrections order. 

18Now, Mr Hazell, I have seen you many more times than most offenders. Most offenders come in once. I send them to gaol. They go out that door. I never see them again. I have spent a lot of time with you because I consider, as I have just said in that judgment, that it is best to focus on your rehabilitation. But that does not mean that you are out of the woods yet. Should there be an adverse report between now and 13 April when you come back before me there is still a chance you will be going to gaol for more time. Do you understand that? You have done well so far, do not let up your obvious positive efforts to keep out of trouble. Do you understand?

19OFFENDER: Yes, sir.

20HIS HONOUR: You are close to avoiding further gaol, but you haven't got there yet. Do you understand?

21OFFENDER: Yes, sir.

22HIS HONOUR: I will adjourn.

2416234,R v A; R v Hurst [2012] NSWDC 186,"Sentence

1The offenders Shane Hurst and A each adhered to their plea of guilty in relation to two offences:

(1)On 10 April 2010 at Cougal, wound Jarrod McShane with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum available penalty for a contravention of s 33(1)(a) is twenty-five years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of seven years. This offence is a serious children's indictable offence, which means that A (who, at the time of the offence, was a juvenile) is to be tried as an adult.

(2)On the same date and at the same place, in company recklessly cause grievous bodily harm to Mr McShane. The maximum available penalty for a contravention of s 35 of the Crimes Act 1900 is fourteen years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of five years.

2The wounding that is the subject of the s 33(1)(a) offence was caused by stabbing. The grievous bodily harm in relation to the offence against s 35 was a broken left jaw. The Crown relies upon joint criminal enterprise between the offenders and Lyndsey Pankhurst. In addition, the Crown relies upon individual stabbings by each of the three offenders in relation to the offence against s 33(1)(a). 

3The offenders were committed for trial in March 2011 and they pleaded guilty later in 2011. The Crown suggested that a discount of approximately twenty per cent for the pleas of guilty would be appropriate in the case of Mr Hurst. That is a generous suggestion, which I adopt. In the case of A, she provided significant assistance to the police by way of informing them as to the location of the knife that had been hidden after the incident and the location of clothing that had been disposed of (presumably by Mr Hurst) after the incident. Mr Harrison for A has submitted that a combined discount in the vicinity of thirty per cent would be appropriate. The Crown accepts that such a discount is not inappropriate. I agree with the proposed discount for A. 

4The facts in relation to the offences are contained in Exhibit B. In brief, Mr Hurst was in a relationship with A, who was seventeen years of age. Mr Hurst was twenty years old. They were acquainted with Ms Pankhurst. Mr Hurst planned to purchase ecstasy tablets in Brisbane and he borrowed funds for that purpose. The three offenders and the victim travelled to Brisbane in the victim's BMW vehicle. They waited in the Queen Street Mall for some hours for Mr Hurst's associates to arrive with the drugs. That did not occur. They left to return home to Casino. En route home, they took a detour to an area known as the Border Loop. This is an isolated location near the Queensland- New South Wales border, where trains pass through a tunnel or a loop. When they arrived at the Border Loop, they waited a while. They saw a train. Another vehicle pulled up containing two older couples, to whom the victim spoke. The victim was keen to leave. Mr Hurst suggested that he and the victim have a private talk. They walked a short distance from the vehicle for that purpose. 

5As they were returning to the vehicle, Mr Hurst was behind the victim. He stabbed the victim twice in the back and then kicked him to the ground. He started to kick the victim in the head. A and Ms Pankhurst came over to where the victim was on the ground. A willingly participated in kicking the victim in the head. She was then given the knife, which according to the victim, Mr Hurst generally carried. Ms Pankhurst was then handed the knife. She delivered a further stab to the victim's left side. At one stage, the victim was dragged to a slightly different location. He sustained a number of abrasions to various parts of the body. Throughout the incident, which took a considerable period of time, the assailants were taunting the victim. A delivered some very cruel taunts. She incited Ms Pankhurst to stab the victim, telling her that ""it's just like stabbing a chicken, just do it"". At one stage, A said to the others ""finish it"". She says that, she meant ""finish the assault"". The co-offenders apparently took it to mean something to the effect of ""finish him off"" or ""finish it off"". Mr Hurst and Ms Pankhurst proceeded to move the victim to an area where he could be rolled down a steep embankment. 

6During the attack, the victim was terrified. He felt himself going cold and he thought that he would die. After he was pushed down the embankment, he was terrified that the offenders were still at the Border Loop car park and he remained quietly part way down the embankment until he was certain that they had departed. He thinks that he was down the embankment for about half an hour. He was seriously injured and he feared that he might pass out and die. After he was sure that the car doors had slammed and the vehicle had left, he carefully and slowly made his way up the embankment. Because of the remote location, he was nowhere near assistance. He had to walk for a number of kilometres in an injured condition until he located someone who was able to drive him into town. 

7The victim was treated for his injuries. Ultimately, it was ascertained that he had suffered five stab wounds to the back, the most serious of which was three to five centimetres in depth. The remainder were point five to two centimetres deep. He also suffered a stab wound to the left side, which was point five to two centimetres in depth. All the wounds were one to two centimetres long. A total of twenty-one sutures were applied to seal the wounds. The victim suffered significant bruising and abrasions to various parts of his body, including his face and head. Soon after the incident, he discovered that he had suffered a fractured left jaw. He underwent surgery. Plates and screws were inserted. From a physical perspective, the victim has made a good recovery. 

8The victim provided a victim impact statement. The difficulties disclosed in that statement are the sort of difficulties that are almost inevitably associated with an incident of this nature. The victim has a great deal of difficulty working with sharp knives as they cause him to experience flashbacks to the incident. He has suffered a number of psychological symptoms, difficulty sleeping and problems socialising in any very public environment. This causes problems, both socially and in relation to work. He is trying to move on with his life but it is very difficult because of intrusive psychological thoughts. It is to be hoped that, when these proceedings have concluded, his psychological state will improve.

9Immediately after the incident, the offenders agreed to a version of events that they would tell to other people. It was a rather absurd story. It involved the BMW breaking down and the victim leaving to find help and then failing to return. For a period of time, the offenders adhered to the story. They arrived back in Casino at about 2.10am. A little later that morning, the BMW was located in Casino with its registration plates removed. On the same day, 10 April, Mr Hurst and A were interviewed. They gave the agreed version of events to the police. 

10Later that evening, A returned and said that she wanted to help the police. She told them where they could find the knife. The knife contained a blood sample belonging to the victim. She indicated that she was prepared to be re-interviewed, but the police were reluctant to proceed in that way because she was a juvenile. On 15 April, she provided further information concerning the whereabouts of clothing that Mr Hurst had disposed of and two latex gloves that he had attempted to burn (inferentially, because they could contain forensic evidence). On 27 April, A provided a statement implicating the others. At that stage, she was seeking to minimise her own involvement. Based on the assistance provided by A, which was early and quite substantial, the combined discount of 30% for the plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities is appropriate. 

11In relation to the objective seriousness of the offences, a number of things should be noted. A number of circumstances indicate the forethought and/or planning given to the offences. There was pre-existing antagonism between the victim and Mr Hurst, which was fuelled by the failed drug deal in Brisbane. Mr Hurst became very angry indeed. When the victim was on the ground, Mr Hurst and A repeatedly reminded the victim of the ""three Rs"", i.e. respect, revenge and reputation. Mr Hurst considered that the victim had ruined his reputation with drug vendors in Brisbane, and he was determined to exact revenge on the victim. When the group was at the lookout, the victim was ready to leave and was becoming a little uneasy. Mr Hurst said that they should stay and then suggested that the victim move away from the vehicle to have a discussion with him. Immediately after that discussion, he attacked the victim from behind. Generally, Mr Hurst carried the knife in question; it cannot be inferred that he armed himself for the purpose of stabbing the victim. When the attack by Mr Hurst commenced, A did not demonstrate any surprise or resistance, but almost immediately joined in the attack. A encouraged the disposal of the victim down the embankment. Ms Pankhurst and Mr Hurst pushed the victim down the bank. They all left in the victim's car and agreed to a version of events to which they adhered for a short period of time. 

12The Court concludes that there must have been some forethought that something untoward would or, at least, may well occur during the detour to the Border Loop. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offenders contemplated that something untoward may well occur during the detour to the Border Loop. However, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was any planning of serious violence or forethought given to the level of violence that was ultimately delivered at the Border Loop. There was a growing dissatisfaction on the part of Mr Hurst, which exploded in the angry outburst and sustained aggressive behaviour towards the victim following the initial stabbing. 

13There are two primary elements in relation to the objective seriousness of such offences. First, the conduct. That encompasses any pre-planning or forethought. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was pre-planning. It also encompasses the roles that each of the offenders played. The matter has been prosecuted on the basis of joint criminal enterprise. Each of the offenders is responsible for the acts of the others, but it is apparent that Mr Hurst's direct role was the greatest. He had the greatest hostility towards the victim. Ms Pankhurst harboured a different type of illfeeling towards him. As far as A is concerned, there is no evidence that she was involved in planning prior to the incident. Mr Hurst was the one who was carrying the knife and who brought it out. He was the one who was concerned about his reputation with undesirable elements in Brisbane. He was the instigator of the stabbing, and he delivered the first two stabs. He also kicked the victim to the ground, where the victim became an easy target for the others to continue the sustained assault. On the other hand, A joined in willingly. Not only did she participate in kicking and stabbing the victim at least twice, but she also delivered cruel insults and taunts to the victim. Combined with the physical assaults, this caused the victim to become absolutely terrified. The events occurred at an isolated location, one where the victim was very unlikely to find assistance. It is a tribute to the victim that he had the discipline to get himself to the top of the embankment and then walk a long distance for help. 

14Second, the level of grievous bodily harm and wounding. In relation to the injuries, the fracture to the left jaw is not one of the most serious types of grievous bodily harm. Plates and pins have been inserted and the victim has made a good recovery. In relation to the wounding, there were five stab wounds but only one was of significant depth, i.e. the wound that penetrated three to five centimetres. As far as the Court is aware, the victim made a very good physical recovery from the wounding. Inevitably, he has been left with significant psychological sequelae. 

15The Court does not look at the spectrum of offences to ascertain where the subjective offences lie in terms of mid range of objective seriousness. This was a serious offence for the reasons that I have articulated. The maximum available penalties and the standard non-parole period set by the legislature are guideposts. A very significant sentence of imprisonment must be imposed. In relation to A, Mr Harrison has submitted that, if a sentence at the very bottom end of the range of two years was imposed, then the Court could look at suspending the sentence. The Court's first task is to determine the appropriate sentence and then to look at the way in which it should be served. 

16I will turn to the subjective circumstances of the offenders. Mr Hurst is now twenty-two years of age. He was twenty years of age at the date of the offence. Mr Hurst has a prior juvenile history but it is not of any great significance. It pales in comparison to the conduct for which the Court is to sentence him. Offences of affray and being armed with intent to commit a serious indictable offence were committed in 2007. A nine month control order was made and suspended for nine months. There was an incident of offending behaviour in 2007, which resulted in twelve months probation. There is no significant prior criminal history on the part of Mr Hurst, although he is not a person without prior involvement with the criminal justice system. He has not reoffended while on bail. He was released to bail on 26 June 2010, having been held in detention in relation to these offences alone for a period of six-seven days, from his arrest to June 2010. For a period of more than eighteen months he has been crime free. He has been on stringent bail conditions, which have been like a form of detention since he has been unable to leave his residence unless he is in the company of his father or both of his grandparents. That has severely restricted his activities. The restriction of liberty needs to be taken into account in the sentences that I impose.

17Mr Hurst had a very difficult upbringing. His parents separated when he was approximately seven years of age. He resided with his mother and her then partner, where he was exposed to domestic violence and abuse that was very disturbing. He then moved to Casino to reside with his father. At some point during his early teens, he began to act in a delinquent fashion. From twelve years of age, he used tobacco, alcohol and cannabis, which helped him to relax and cope with the psychological stresses that he was under. Within a couple of years, he was using amphetamines, cocaine, LSD and ice. He left school in Year 11. At eighteen years of age, he moved to Brisbane. By that stage, he was using drugs daily, partying and using drugs such as ecstasy. His father and others observed that, during the latter part of his teens, the offender increasingly behaved in an aggressive and unpredictable fashion, often snapping and behaving violently, punching walls and the like. The offender was first admitted to Lismore Hospital for attempted suicide at sixteen years of age. There have been several overdoses and attempts at self-injury. 

18Since the incident, the offender's conduct has changed dramatically. He has sought and received extensive medical intervention. He was treated by Dr Petroff, a psychiatrist, on about eighteen occasions up to January 2011. Dr Lynette Arnoldus-Lewis has seen him since January 2011, initially once a week and then once a fortnight. She notes the offender's depression and remorse over the incident, and his commitment to changing and making something of his life. She refers to his extremely traumatic childhood and the need for intervention over a long period to address the issues arising from a dysfunctional childhood, including the drug and alcohol and anger issues. He needs intervention in relation to education and general coping skills. That is a general assessment with which Dr Allnutt, a psychiatrist, agrees. He says that the offender probably suffers from a mood disorder characterised by symptoms of depression and anxiety, complicated by a long history of substance abuse, against a background of a dysfunctional upbringing that predisposed the offender to depression. Dr Allnutt considers that the offender needs psychiatric and psychological treatment as well as drug and alcohol treatment and vocational assistance. I heard evidence from the offender's father, a truck driver, as to the dramatic changes that he has observed in the offender since the offence. The offender is much calmer. He has been able to behave himself, staying at home with the family and rarely going out at night except when the family goes to a family function. He has been getting on very well with the family, including his grandparents. 

19The offender's psychological situation and drug addiction was affecting him mentally at the time of the incident. He was also suffering ""paranoid thoughts"" about being threatened, particularly by Aboriginal people. He had a past association with skinheads and there had been racist behaviour by him in the past. Perhaps there were good reasons for him to feel ""paranoid"". His state of mind was not assisted by using ice and similar drugs. He said that he had imbibed some form of amphetamine (perhaps it was ice) within a matter of hours before the incident. After bail was refused, he experienced auditory hallucinations for some months, presumably as a consequence of drug withdrawal. The offender's judgment was very much clouded at the time of the incident. That is not an excuse, but it is something of an explanation for the bizarre behaviour and some of the remarks that were made to the victim during the course of the incident. 

20A has no prior criminal history. She has spent no time in detention in relation to this matter. A is now nineteen. She was seventeen years of age at the date of the offence. She was born in Lismore. She has one younger brother. She had a very difficult childhood. Her parents separated when she was a baby. Her mother formed a new relationship when A was very young. There were disputes over her custody. Her mother had several relationships, some of which involved physical and verbal abuse. A went to live with her father when she was about nine years of age. At fourteen years of age, she became involved in a violent and controlling relationship with a drug addict who was then eighteen years of age. Thereafter, he was periodically imprisoned. When not in prison, he managed to get her pregnant on two occasions. She has been the sole parent of her two children. They are now aged two and three and a half years. She completed Year 9 at school. In Year 10, she attempted distance education. That attempt was thwarted because she became pregnant. She saw a psychologist a number of times in 2010. When she was in the relationship, she engaged in significant drug abuse. She says that she has largely addressed that problem. 

21A has good personal resources. She has impressed persons who have reported on her as someone of reasonably high intelligence who has an interest in education. She wants to complete her schooling and attend university, possibly studying psychology at university. She genuinely wishes to make substantial changes in her life. According to the reporters, she has the capacity to do so. She does not have an anti-social personality. Rather, her offending behaviour was the product of situational factors. A's situation is neatly summarised in a report of Mr Nisbet dated 22 September 2011 (on the second last page):

""[A's] background contains numerous experiences of developmental adversity including parental separation, childhood abuse, domestic violence and early motherhood. These experiences are likely to have resulted in [A] seeing the world as a hostile and uncaring place and understanding relationships as being typically coercive and exploitative. The immediate precipitants to the offences were anger at the victim as a result of remarks he made to her and the opportunity to exploit his weakness resulting from the injuries he had already sustained. The reckless and callous nature of [A's] involvement in the offences is considered to be more the result of situational factors rather than the result of any severe antisocial personality traits.""

He concludes:
""She therefore has the ability to modify her behaviour, change her associates and remain within boundaries imposed on her by the court. She has both academic potential and a history of employment. Her potential for self development will be impeded by the legacy of her early adverse developmental experiences.""

She enjoys the support of the organisations in Lismore with whom she may continue to have contact. That will assist her rehabilitation.

22In sentencing both offenders, I take into account the relevant aggravating and mitigating features under s 21A. I also consider the sentencing objectives under s 3A. In relation to A, I consider the provisions of s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Most of those statements in s 6 are, in effect, motherhood statements. Of particular relevance to this case is s 6(c), which states that it is desirable wherever possible to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption. Section 6(d) talks about allowing a child to reside in his or her own home. Part (f) talks about the desirability of assisting children to reintegrate into the community so as to sustain family and community ties. As the Crown submitted, the conduct of A was like that of an adult, although as a seventeen year old, she would not have had the maturity and judgment of an adult. One cannot overlook the capacity of a seventeen year old to accept responsibility for their actions and their effect on the victim. Those matters are referred to in s 6(g) and (h). 

23Section 3(a) refers to the need to ensure that there is adequate punishment. Part (b) refers to general and specific deterrence. Part (c) refers to the protection of the community. In this case, this seems of lesser importance, given the demonstrated rehabilitation of the offenders. It is important to promote the rehabilitation of the offenders, particularly as each is a young adult. In the case of younger persons, considerations of rehabilitation and may be more important than considerations of general deterrence. However, in the case of serious offences of the type in question, general deterrence cannot be ignored. Accountability, denunciation and recognition of harm are very important considerations. 

24In relation to the s 21A aggravating features, the question of being in company is something that is an element of the s 35 offence. In relation to the s 33 offence, it is not an element but joint criminal enterprise is relied upon by the Crown. I take into account the fact that there were three persons involved and that made it more frightening for the victim. It is not entirely clear as to who inflicted what wounds. A weapon was used. That is an aggravating factor, although, in the case of wounding, it is very often the case that a weapon is used and very often that weapon is a knife. I do not know how I should take into account the factor in s 21A(2)(ea), which talks about the offence being committed in the presence of a child under eighteen years. A was a child, but she was also a participant. I do not think that that part is intended to address the present. 

25In relation to the relevant mitigating factors, I have referred to the lack of any substantial record on the part of Mr Hurst. A had no record and was, a person of good character. I am satisfied that, provided that they continue rehabilitation, it is unlikely that the offenders will reoffend, particularly in the case of A. Given her age at the time and the fact that she has very good prospects in relation to her future education and employment, I am satisfied that she is unlikely to reoffend in any significant way. As for Mr Hurst, I am optimistic that that is the case, although one cannot be certain. Given the various factors referred to in the reports, there are good prospects of rehabilitation for both of the offenders. One of the relevant considerations is their age and the increasing maturity that each is showing. Both offenders have expressed remorse on many occasions. Both entered a plea of guilty (which I have already discussed). I have referred to the assistance provided by A to law enforcement authorities. 

26In relation to A, as I propose imposing a custodial sentence, it is necessary to consider the submission of Mr Harrison that any sentence of imprisonment should be the subject of an order directing that the term and the non parole period be served as a juvenile offender. That requires the Court to consider whether there are special circumstances justifying the detention of A as a juvenile offender, as she has already attained eighteen years of age. Mr Harrison relies upon s 19(4)(c), which reads:
""If the person were committed to a correctional centre there would be an unacceptable risk of the person suffering physical or psychological harm whether due to the nature of the person's offence, any assistance given by the person in the prosecution of other persons or otherwise.""

In this case, it is submitted that A, would suffer an unacceptable risk of psychological harm by virtue of the diminished capacity that she would have for contact with her two children should she be incarcerated in an adult institution. For some time now, she has resided with her father. She has negotiated an arrangement with him whereby he is prepared to look after her children. That will provide the children with some continuity, but it will be very different from the current situation where their care is primarily her responsibility. There is no suggestion of her taking the children with her to prison and I would not advocate such a course. The Court has been advised by Ms Saville from Juvenile Justice of the different arrangements that could be made for the offender if she was incarcerated as a juvenile. The arrangements would reduce the risk of her suffering psychological harm by virtue of the separation from her children if she was placed in an adult prison. Whether she is placed in an adult or a juvenile institution, she will be housed somewhere in Sydney. That is a very long way from northern New South Wales. She has been through some very difficult times with the children, and she is going to suffer psychologically whatever happens. However, if she is kept in a juvenile institution, Juvenile Justice will assist her and the children to have access to each other by way of video link. If her father is able to make his way to Sydney with the children, there will be much greater flexibility in relation to extended access. I infer that the access arrangements will be much more congenial than would be the case in an adult institution. Disregarding for a moment the position from the children's perspective (because it is not referred to in the provision, rather remarkably), I am satisfied on the basis of the information provided by Ms Saville (and the Crown concedes) that there is an unacceptable risk of psychological harm if A is housed in an adult institution. That risk will be vastly diminished if she is housed in a juvenile institution. That argument is sustained. 

27I was referred to the sentencing statistics, which provide a yardstick but do not dictate an appropriate sentence. Recently, in Hili v R [2010] HCA 45, the High Court said that it is far more constructive to look at particular cases. I have looked at the cases of McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110 and SB [2011] NSW CCA 95. I have been referred to the Public Defender's Sentencing Table, but that contains little background information

28I will deal with Mr Hurst first. You are convicted of both matters. In relation to the offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, the starting point for the sentence is three years imprisonment. I have deducted twenty per cent resulting in a sentence of two years and five months. You are sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years and five months from 29 November 2011 to 28 April 2014. For the more serious offence under s 33, the starting point is six years imprisonment. I deduct twenty per cent to arrive at a sentence of four years and ten months. I have partly accumulated that sentence. That sentence will commence on 29 June 2012. The minimum period that you should spend in custody overall is a period of two years and eleven months. I fix a non-parole period of two years and four months for the s 33 offence. Your non-parole period will expire on 28 October 2014 and you will be eligible for release to parole on that date. The balance of the sentence will expire on 28 April 2017. You have been sentenced to an effective sentence of five years and five months with an effective non -parole period of two years and eleven months. In setting that non-parole period, I have taken into account special circumstances, being your youth, the lack of a prior significant criminal record, and first time imprisoned. I have also taken into account the period and nature of your bail and your demonstrated efforts towards rehabilitation and the fact that you will need a long period of support in the community once you are released. 

29A, you are convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for each of these matters. In relation to the s 35 offence, the starting point for the sentence is two years imprisonment. I have deducted thirty percent to arrive at a sentence of seventeen months imprisonment, which will start on 14 February 2012. Since there are some quite special circumstances pertaining to you, the minimum period that you should spend in custody is a period of twelve months. I am setting a non-parole period to expire on 13 February 2013. The balance of the term for the kicking offence will expire on 13 July 2013. For the s 33 offence, the more serious offence, the starting point is three years imprisonment, I have deducted thirty per cent to arrive at a sentence of twentyfive months imprisonment. I have accumulated that by a factor of four months, so the sentence will start on 14 June 2012. For that offence, I fix a non-parole period of eight months, which will expire on 13 February 2013. The balance of that sentence will expire on 13 July 2014. You have been sentenced to an effective term of imprisonment of two years and five months with a non-parole period of twelve months. In setting that non-parole period, I have taken into account the special circumstances of your youth and the fact that you were a juvenile at the time of commission of the offences. I have also taken into account the needs of your children, the fact that you have not previously been imprisoned and the fact that you need a long period of support in the community following your release. Pursuant to s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, I make an order directing that the non-parole period is to be served as a juvenile offender.

HER HONOUR: Is there anything further Mr Crown?

MCLENNAN: Yes unfortunately there is, there is a s 166 certificate in respect of each of the offenders and of course Ms Pankhurst, it deals with the offence of in the case of these two offenders being carried in a conveyance pursuant to s 154A of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is five years imprisonment on indictment. Subject to anything that your Honour may wish to say, a concurrent sentence for a fixed term would seem to be appropriate.

30Subject to anything that anyone wants to say, I am happy to proceed by way of imposing a concurrent sentence. In the case of Mr Hurst, I would be minded to sentence him to a fixed term of imprisonment of six months to run concurrent with the s 35 sentence. In the case of A, I sentence her to a fixed term of imprisonment of three months to run concurrent with the s 35 sentence. Unless anyone wants to be heard, I impose those sentences.

		09 October 2012",2012-02-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2416246,Roberts v R [2012] NSWCCA 232,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of remaining in a building with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely intimidation, contrary to s 114(1)(d) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment.

2When sentenced the applicant asked that the following matters be included on a Form 1:

i.intimated police officer in execution of duty (s 61 Crimes Act 1900);
ii.have custody of an offensive implement in a public place (s 11B Summary Offences Act 1988);
iiicommon assault (s 61 Crimes Act 1900);
ivcontravene apprehended domestic violence order (s 14(1) Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence Act) 2007).

3The applicant was sentence to a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months with a balance of term of 9 months. He seeks leave to appeal against his sentence and raises 2 grounds of appeal.

Ground 1:His Honour erred in finding that the offence was at least in the middle of any scale.

Ground 2:The starting point of 4 years imprisonment was manifestly excessive.

4The sentencing judge was provided with an agreed statement of facts. It indicates that the victim, Leanne Jones, and the applicant had been in an on-again, off-again defacto relationship for the past 23 years. Domestic violence against the victim featured in this relationship and the applicant has been convicted of a number of personal violence offences against the victim. As at 14 March 2010 the applicant was subject to an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (ADVO) imposed for the victim's protection with the following conditions:

1(a)Not to assault, molest, harass, threaten or otherwise interfere with the protected person or a person with whom she has a domestic relationship.
1(b)Not to engage in any other conduct that intimidates the protected person or a person with whom she has a domestic relationship.
1(c)Not to stalk the protected person or a person with whom she has a domestic relationship.
Not to approach the protected person or any such premises or place at which the protected person from time to time reside or work within twelve (12) hours of consuming intoxicating liquor or illicit drugs.
Not to destroy or deliberately damage or interfere with the property of the protected person.

5On 14 March 2010 the applicant and the victim attended the 21st birthday party of their daughter's partner. After the party they returned to their residence. At about 8 pm they became involved in a heated argument. The applicant produced a tomahawk approximately 30 cm in length with an axe head approximately 10 cm in length. He refused to leave the premises and the victim contacted triple-0 on a number of occasions.

6The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court and adhered to his plea in the District Court. The sentencing judge provided a 25 percent discount for the utilitarian value of his plea.

7The applicant has a significant criminal record for crimes of violence and threats of violence to the victim, police officers and others. It is apparent that much of his offending occurs at times when he is under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The applicant was subject to four bonds to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months. Three of those bonds were as a result of breaches of apprehended violence orders and one for intimidating the police. They were imposed only 3 weeks before the present offences were committed.

8The applicant was born in 1971 and was 39 years of age when sentenced. He was first convicted in 1986 in relation to an offence of break, enter and steal. In the following years he committed various offences until, in 1992, he was sentenced for a more serious offence of robbery and attempted robbery whilst armed. He has various driving offences and drug related offences. His driving offences include offences relating to alcohol.

9The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge. His Honour recorded that the applicant ""spoke of having seen the light and being avowed to give up alcohol."" The sentencing judge accepted the applicant as being genuine but doubted whether he would adhere to his vow of abstinence. Although his Honour was asked to consider making a finding of special circumstances, his Honour concluded that the statutory period of parole was appropriate in the circumstances. 

10The sentencing judge observed that the crimes for which the applicant was to be sentenced were:

""Prevalent and very serious indeed and carried out by the offender in continuation of similar criminality of violence and threats of violence to the victim, others and police officers being courses he has embarked upon over many years whilst under the influence of intoxicating liquor."" 

11His Honour also said: 

""I regard this offence at being at least in the middle of any scale constructed for such offences and this offence and the matters contained on the Form 1 schedule should all result in prison sentences.""

Ground 1

12In support of this ground it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that s 114(1) of the Crimes Act provides for a variety of offences. It was submitted that s 114(1)(d) encompasses conduct involving unlawful and/or forceful entry onto premises with intent to commit more serious offences against multiple victims and, accordingly, it was erroneous of his Honour to conclude that the offence was in the middle of any scale for such offences.

13Section 114(1)(d) provides that a person commits an offence if he or she ""enters or remains in or upon any part of the building or any land occupied or used in connection therewith with intent to commit an indictable offence in or upon the building."" 

14It is correct that the offence would encompass conduct more serious than that committed by the applicant but this would most likely involve offences marked out by aggravating circumstances. An offence is not mitigated by the absence of features that would give rise to a more serious offence and when considering the range of offences within s 114(1)(d) it is important to bear in mind the constraints upon any finding of the seriousness of the offence resulting from the principles discussed by the High Court in R v De Simoni (1981) HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383.

15The applicant further submitted that the indictable offence nominated for the s 114(1) charge was ""intimidation"" and submitted, that being an offence with a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment, it could never give rise to an offence under s 114(1)(d) falling within the middle of the range. In the course of oral submissions this submission, as made in writing, was withdrawn. It is not correct. The indictable offence nominated in the charge was the offence of intimidation contrary to s 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.

16With respect to the applicant's primary submission, the determination of the seriousness of an offence is an evaluative exercise which must be conducted by the sentencing judge. It is based on the circumstances of the offence, which require an evaluation by the sentencing judge having regard to the particular conduct of the offender being sentenced. This Court will only intervene in the assessment of the seriousness of the offence where there is identifiable error: Ayoub and El Mazri v R (2010) NSWCCA 196 at [25], and there are many other cases to similar effect.

17In the present case the applicant took possession of a tomahawk during the argument with the victim. He refused to leave the premises and prevented the victim from leaving. He punched her and held the blade of the tomahawk to her throat. When leaving the premises he called her a ""slut"" and a ""dog."" His Honour did not suggest that the offence was the worst of its type. I am in no doubt that it was open to his Honour to describe the offence as at least falling within the middle of any scale of seriousness.

Ground 2

18As I have previously indicated his Honour provided a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea with a consequence that he must have identified a head sentence of 4 years as appropriate but for that plea. It was submitted that this notional starting point was excessive having regard to the relevant statistics published by the Judicial Commission. 

19It was further submitted that his Honour erroneously had regard to the applicant's criminal history and his breach of conditional liberty when assessing the seriousness of the offence. In support of this contention the applicant referred to the following remark of the sentencing judge: 

""Only a sentence of imprisonment will satisfy the requirements for general and specific deterrence in this case. Taking into account the matters on the Form 1 schedule, conviction would in the view of this Court, result after trial, in a sentence of some 4 years imprisonment, bearing in mind the use of a weapon and the repetition with which these offences have been carried out against his partner.""

20I am not persuaded that in either of these respects advanced by the applicant his Honour fell into error. Although when regard is had to the statistics produced by the Judicial Commission the starting ponit for the sentence is apparently high, it is important to bear in mind the circumstances of the offence and of the applicant. As I have earlier indicated, the offence was serious. When sentencing the applicant his Honour was required to impose a sentence which adequately reflected the circumstances in which the offences were committed and recognised the applicant's (in the words of the High Court) ""manifestation of a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law"", Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 4 (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ). So much was made plain from his significant record for offences indicating an increasing seriousness of criminal activity.

21When determining the appropriate sentence his Honour correctly identified the seriousness of the offence but also recognised the matters on the Form 1 and the need for general and specific deterrence. I do not understand anything his Honour said to indicate that his Honour had regard to the applicant's criminal history or his breaches of conditional liberty when considering the objective seriousness of the offence as opposed to the appropriate sentence for the applicant having regard to all the circumstances.

22The applicant's counsel was critical of the fact that his Honour referred to the applicant's criminal record and breach of bonds before indicating that the offence was ""in the middle of any scale constructed for such offences."" I am satisfied that this is a misreading of his Honour's remarks. His Honour said after discussing the applicant's criminal record and previous behaviour that he regarded the offence as being in the middle of the scale in a manner clearly directed towards the objective circumstances. I am not persuaded that his Honour erroneously allowed the subjective matters to influence his finding in relation to the seriousness of the offending.

23Even if I was satisfied that an error had occurred, which I am not, I am of the view that the sentence which his Honour imposed was appropriate. The applicant's conduct was serious and the appropriate sentence required consideration to be given to the matters on the Form 1. The offence was committed in the context of a history of domestic violence. In that respect in R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; (2006) 164 CLR A Crim R 179 Johnson J said at [86]:

""In sentencing a domestic violence offender, and in particular a repeat domestic violence offender, specific and general deterrence are important factors, together with the requirement of powerful denunciation by the community of such conduct and the need for protection of the community. Recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community as a result of crimes of domestic violence is important.""

24The applicant has a serious criminal history. He was 39 years of age at the time of the offence, and although he promised to abstain from alcohol, his Honour was not confident that this would occur and, accordingly, his prosects of rehabilitation are uncertain. The offence was committed in breach of two forms of conditional liberty which were imposed for the victim's protection, which included the Apprehended Domestic Violence Order and 3 bonds to be of good behaviour. The applicant was also subject to a 12 month bond to be of good behaviour for intimidating a police officer in execution of his duty.

25In the circumstances I find that no lesser sentence is warranted. However, the applicant was in my opinion so devoid of merit that I refuse leave to appeal.

26HIDDEN J: I also see no error in his Honour's approach. Counsel for the applicant placed some emphasis on his evidence in which he expressed his determination to reform. It is apparent to me, however, that his Honour did have regard to that evidence and gave it the weight it deserved. I agree with the order proposed.

27ROTHMAN J: I agree with the Chief Judge at Common Law and the additional comments of Hidden J.

28McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The orders of the court are as I have indicated.

2416383,"Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water v November Foxtrot Sierra Pty Limited [2012] NSWLC 2","Judgment

1The Defendant Company owns a property called Wards Mistake Station through which flows Nowlands Creek. The Company is charged with an offence under the Water Act 1912 being that it failed to comply with a direction given by the Water Administration Ministerial Corporation to remove an earthen embankment across Nowlands Creek by 21 December 2008. The Court Attendance Notice states details of the offence as follows:





Description of Offence:


The Defendant failed to comply with a direction given to it by the Water Administration Ministerial Corporation to remove the whole of a work to which Part 2 of the Water Act 1912 extends (being a work in respect of which no right conferred by Part 2 or Part 10 of the Water Act 1912 exists and in respect of which no licence, group licence, irrigation corporation licence, authority or permit was in force) which is situated on land owned by the Defendant.



Date of offence:

On or about 21 December 2008


Place of offence:

Lots 5 and 29 in Deposited Plan 751483, Parish of Ward, County of Clarke, Guyra Local Government Area


Short particulars:

Particulars of the direction
The direction under section 21B(1)(b) of the Water Act 1912 dated 20 November 2008 given to the Defendant by the Water Administration Ministerial Corporation to remove the earthen embankment of a dam on Lots 5 and 29 in Deposited Plan 751483 (""the Dam"") by 21 December 2008. The geographic Cartesian coordinates of the Dam are Easting 404940 and Northing 6668701.
Particulars of work to which Part 2 of the Water Act 1912 extends (being a work in respect of which no right conferred by Part 2 or Part 10 of the Water Act 1912 exists and in respect of which no licence, group licence, irrigation corporation licence, authority or permit was in force)
The earthen embankment of the Dam and associated works
Particulars of the failure to comply
The Defendant did not remove the earthen embankment of the Dam (i.e. the dam wall) by 21 December 2008.
Particulars of land owned by the Defendant
The Defendant is the registered owner of Lots 5 and 29 in Deposited Plan 751483.



Statutory Provision Describing Offence:

Section 21B(1)(b) Water Act 1912 (NSW)

Preliminary matters
2The case was mentioned in Glen Innes Local Court in July 2010 and it was transferred to Armidale Local Court. An application to transfer the proceedings to the Local Court at the Downing Centre was not successful and the case remained in Armidale.

3Brief orders were made in October 2010 and the case was set down for hearing on 1 February 2011. Evidence was given and submissions made on a preliminary point regarding the lawfulness of the delegation under which the direction was given pursuant to section 21B(1)(b) of the Water Act 1912. A written decision was handed down in favour of the Prosecution on 28 February 2011 (Department of the Environment, Climate Change and Water v November Foxtrot Sierra Pty Ltd [2011] NSWLC 39).

4The substantive case was set down for hearing with evidence being given on 10 June and 6 December 2011. Delays in obtaining transcript held back the preparation of submissions but the Prosecutor's submissions were received by the end of December 2011 and the Defendant's by the end of January 2012.

5The parties tendered evidence on the delegated powers and the Prosecutor tendered a substantial brief of evidence in the substantive case. A number of prosecution witnesses were called to give evidence at the hearing including Dr Steven Beaman, Beverley Hanna, Katrina O'Reilly, Dr David Outhet (an expert witness) and for the Defendant Boyd Munro (Director of the defendant company) and Professor Mark Taylor (an expert witness). Numerous other exhibits were tendered by the parties in their respective cases.

Notice of admissions

6At the outset of the substantive case, a voir dire point was raised by the Defendant in regard to certain admissions made by its legal representatives to the prosecution. A Notice by its solicitor, Turtons Lawyers, dated 18 January 2011, made admissions that the earthen embankment is a work which falls within the definition of the expression ""work to which this Part extends"" as defined in section 5 of the Water Act 1912. This admission was potentially fatal to the Defendant's case and an application was made to exclude it under section 90 of the Evidence Act 1995. Arguments were heard on the application which was decided in favour of the Defendant. The evidence of the admission was ruled inadmissible on the basis that it would be unfair to that party to admit it. This ruling effectively put the Prosecution in a position whereby it must prove its case.

7In a Notice of Admitted Facts, the following was admitted by the Defendant:

(1)The Defendant owns Lots 5 and 29 in DP751483, comprising part of a property known as Wards Mistake Station (""the Property"") and has owned the Property at all relevant times.

(2)Nowlands Creek runs through the Property.

(3)In about December 2006, the Defendant carried out certain works on the Property in or in the vicinity of Nowlands Creek, which included the emplacement of an earthen embankment in Nowlands Creek (the ""Earthen Embankment"").

(4)The Earthen Embankment in Nowlands Creek is a work which falls within the definition of the expression ""Work to which this Part extends"", as defined in section 5 of the Water Act 1912.

(5)The Earthen Embankment is located on land owned at all relevant times by the Defendant.

(6)On 16 April 2008, Mr Garry Wills of the NSW Department of Water and Energy, sent a letter to the Defendant attaching a draft form of direction under section 21B(1)(b) of the Water Act 1912. The said letter and draft direction were sent in the form of the documents comprising Annexure 9 to the Statement of Beverley Hanna dated 16 September 2010 and served by the Prosecutor in these proceedings.

(7)On 20 November 2008, Ms Katrina O'Reilly of the NSW Department of Water and Energy, sent the Defendant a purported direction under section 21B(1)(b) of the Water Act 1912 requiring the Defendant to remove the Earthen Embankment within 30 days (the ""Direction""). The Direction and its covering letter were issued by Ms O'Reilly in the form of the documents comprising Annexure B to the statement of Katrina O'Reilly dated 17 September 2010 and served by the Prosecutor in these proceedings.

(8)The Defendant did not remove the Earthen Embankment by 21 December 2008.

(9)The Defendant has not subsequently removed the Earthen Embankment.

(10)The Earthen Embankment is a work in respect of which no right conferred by Part 2 or Part 10 of the Water Act 1912 exists and in respect of which no licence, group licence, irrigation corporation licence, authority or permit is in force within the meaning of section 21B(1)(b) of the Water Act 1912.

Submissions of parties and the law

8To be successful in the substantive case, the Prosecutor is required to prove that the watercourse at the location where the earthen embankment was built falls within the definition of a ""River"" in section 5 of the Water Act 1912. The section provides as follows:

""River"" includes:

(a)a stream of water, whether perennial or intermittent, flowing in a natural channel, or in a natural channel artificially improved, or in an artificial channel which has changed the course of the stream.

(b)an affluent, confluent, branch or other stream of water into or from which a stream referred to in paragraph (a) flows, and

(c)anything declared by the Ministerial Corporation by order published in the Gazette to be a river.

but does not include anything declared by the Ministerial Corporation by order published in the Gazette as not being a river and, unless the regulations otherwise provide, does not include those waters of a tidal river that at any time are not capable of being used for irrigation or for watering stock.

9The definition refers to gazetted orders declaring streams to be rivers. The provision allows the Ministerial Corporation to declare by order published in the Gazette a watercourse not to be or to be a river. On 24 March 2006 the Director General of the Corporation published in the Government Gazette a declaration which had Four Schedules. Schedule 1 provides that certain streams are not rivers. Schedule 2 provides that certain streams are rivers. Schedule 3 encompasses a list of topographic maps and Schedule 4 prescribes the method for determining the stream order of a watercourse known as the Strahler System. The material Gazetted is lengthy comprising many pages.

10In essence, the Prosecution contends that it has proved that Nowlands Creek is a ""river"" within the meaning of 5(1)(a) and (b). The Defendant's submission is to the contrary. It contends that the proviso within section 5 applies bringing the provisions contained in the order Gazetted on 24 March 2006 into play. The Defendant submits that at the point of the earthen embankment, Nowlands Creek is not a river because it is not a third or fourth order stream under the Strahler System and it does not maintain a ""permanent flow of water, being a visible flow which occurs on a continuous basis"". Thus it falls within Schedule 1 which provides that such streams of water are not ""rivers"".

11The Prosecution submits that it has proved its case by any one of the following routes:
(i)The definition of ""river"" as contained within section 5(1) of the Water Act is satisfied whether in terms of Paragraphs (a) or (b) thereof.
(ii)By showing that the provisions of the Order made pursuant to section 5(1) of the Water Act gazetted in the NSW Government Gazette No.37 at page 1500 on 24 March 2006 (the 24 March 2006 Order) do not apply in any event.
(iii)As an alternative to (i) and (ii) above, if it is held by the Court that the 24 March 2006 Order does apply, then under Schedule 2 Clause 1(a)(i) and (ii) Nowlands Creek is a river being a stream of water represented on a topographic map listed in Schedule 3 of that order and being a third, fourth or higher order stream under the Strahler system.
(iv)As an alternative to (i), (ii) and (iii) above, if it is held by the Court that the 24 March 2006 Order does apply, and that the order of the Creek is 1st or 2nd order, then under Schedule 2 Clause 1(b)(iii) of that order Nowlands Creek is a stream of water that maintains a permanent flow of water on a continuous basis and is therefore relevantly a river.
(v)By the failure on the part of the defendant to bring itself within the terms of any exemption, proviso or exclusion to the definition of River such as the exclusion provided for in Schedule 1 of the 24 March 2006 Order.
(vi)Regardless of whether, at the point where the dam is located on Nowlands Creek, that part of the watercourse is a River, the dam on Nowlands Creek is a ""work to which Part 2 of the Water Act extends"" pursuant to subsection (a) and/or (b) of the definition in section 5(1) of the Water Act of ""Work to which this Part extends"" because it is a work:

(a) which is connected with, or which affects the quantity or use of water in, a river or lake;
(b) which affects the quantity of water flowing in, to or from, or contained in, any such river or lake.
 
12The Defendant submits that the Prosecution has not proved its case because it has not proved that Nowlands Creek is a river at the point where the earthen dam was constructed. The Defendant contends that Nowlands Creek does not fall within the definition of a ""river"", is not a third or higher order of stream and does not have a continuous or permanent flow of water at the point where the dam was constructed.

13References were made in submissions to cases which have considered the provisions of the Water Act 1912 and the definition of what constitutes ""a river"" at common law. O'Keefe v Water Management Ministerial Corporation [2010] NSWLEC 9 relates to both aspects and being a decision of the NSW Land and Environment Court it binds this Court. Reference was also made to the comments of Barwick CJ in Knezovic v Shire of Swan-Guildford (1968) 118 CLR 468. In that case the Chief Justice said [footnotes omitted]:

In Gartner v Kidman, the majority of the Justices participating adopted a passage from Angell on Watercourses, 5th ed. (1854), p.3, as stating the meaning at common law of a watercourse, namely:
"".... a watercourse consists of bed, banks and water: yet the water need not flow continuously and there are many watercourses which are sometimes dry. There is, however, a distinction to be taken between a regular flowing stream of water which at certain seasons is dried up and those occasional bursts of water which at times of freshet or melting of ice and snow descend from the hills and inundate the country.""

It seems to me, on an examination of such authorities as exist and of the work of recognized writers on this subject, as well as the decision of the Court, that it is settled that a watercourse consists of a stream with a bed, with banks, and water. That the flow of water in the stream is intermittent or seasonal will not prevent what would otherwise be a watercourse from being accounted such: but though it is quite true that a watercourse may exist though its bed be dry for some periods, the watercourse, in my opinion, must exhibit features of continuity, permanence and unity, best seen, of course, in the existence of a defined bed and banks with flowing water. It must, in my opinion, essentially be a stream and be sharply distinguished from a mere drain, or a drainage depression in the contours of the land which serves to relieve upper land of excess water in times of major precipitation. It is not enough that the water, when it does flow, does so in what may be seen as a defined course or channel. In the case of a drainage depression, the water being drained off can be expected to flow in the lowest portion of the contours confined by the rising levels of the adjacent land: thus water can be seen when flowing to do so in what could be called a defined channel. If the seasonal rainfall is within an average tolerance in amount and timetable, the flow in the depression may well exhibit some regularity in the depth of water flowing in the contour depression and in the extent to which it spreads as it flows. If there is some such normality in the volume flowing, the impression of a defined channel with limiting margins will be enhanced. If as I would expect to be the case, there is considerable variation in the rainfall and in the volume and velocity of the water flowing in the depression, the impression of a defined channel may be considerably less. But in any event, the existence of such a defined channel will not make the drainage depression a watercourse nor the limiting margins of the water flow in a rainy season or period ""banks"" of a stream. Thus though water when it flows in such a period flows in what can be called a defined channel, such a drainage depression will lack banks and a bed in the proper sense of that term, that is to say, identifiable margins of a continuous and permanent stream which contribute to its unity whether or not water is in fact continuously flowing over the bed. The word ""occasional"" in the quotation from Angell on Watercourses will here, in my opinion, embrace seasonal events, even if they occur with some regularity from season to season.""

Where does the onus of proof lie?

14The Prosecutor submits that the definition of ""river"" in section 5 of the Water Act 1912 permits the making of orders by the Ministerial Corporation in the Gazette. It is argued that the publication in the Gazette of an order in 2006 creates an ""exemption, proviso or exclusion"" from the definition given the words used: ""but does not include anything declared.... as not being a river"" in section 5. Thus section 417A of the Crimes Act 1900 applies. It states:

417A Proof of exceptions



(1)Any exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification to the offence (whether or not it is in the same provision with a description of an offence in an Act or statutory rule or document creating the offence) need not be specified or negatived in an indictment or other process commencing proceedings.


(2)The exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification may be proved by the accused person.


(3)If the exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification is specified or negatived in the indictment, court attendance notice or other process commencing proceedings, the prosecutor is not required to prove it.

15The Prosecution refers to numerous cases to support its submission that the onus falls on the Defendant to prove that the stream of water at Nowlands Creek is not a ""river"" pursuant to the provision of the order Gazetted in 2006 and Schedule 1 thereof. Reliance is placed especially on Office of Fair Trading v El Homsi [2009] 74 NSWLR 443 where the Court stated at 447: ""Exceptions.... are to be set up by those who rely on them"".

16The Defendant agrees that the Court should have regard to section 417A of the Crimes Act. Where an offence provision creates a general obligation or prohibition which is subject to a proviso, exemption or exception properly characterised as such, the Prosecutor submits the onus falls on the Defendant to prove that it falls within the exemption, proviso or exception on the balance of probabilities. But the Defendant argues that the Gazetted order simply forms part of the statutory definition of ""river"" and the language used in the Water Act 1912 does not create a general rule which is subject to an exception, exemption or proviso. The Gazetted order amplifies the definition of ""river"" in section 5 of the Water Act 1912. To support this construction, the Defendant refers to DPP v United Telecasters Sydney Pty Ltd (1990) 168 CLR 594; Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd (1990) 170 CLR 249 and ADI Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (2000) 118 A Crim R 335. The latter decision follows what was said by three Justices of the High Court of Australia in Chugg and is a decision of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal. Those authorities support a submission that the schedules in the Gazetted order of 2006 are more accurately characterised as forming part of the definition of ""river"" than it would be to characterise Schedule 1 as creating an exemption, exception or proviso.

17The Court's view is that the material contained in the Gazetted order of November 2006 elaborates on the definition of ""river"" in section 5 in the Water Act 1912. It does not create an exemption from the definition of ""river"" in the Act and it does not create any defence in law. It is simply an amplification on the definition of ""river"" and provides guidance to the Court and others on how to determine whether a ""stream"" is a ""river"". The issue arising about the burden of proof and the prosecution's submission that the defendant must satisfy the Court that the Gazetted order applies is rejected. The Prosecution carries the onus of proving the elements of the offence charged beyond a reasonable doubt. In this regard the Gazetted order provides a guide to the definition of ""river"". It must prove that Nowlands Creek where the dam was constructed was a river in one of the ways contended.

Is the dam constructed pursuant to a Harvestable Rights Order under section 54 of the Water Management Act 2000?

18The Prosecution raises an issue whether the Gazetted order 2006 applies at all because it relates to a dam within the meaning of a harvestable rights order made under section 54 of the Water Management Act. This issue partly arises from the evidence led by the Defendant on the use and purpose of the dam or earthen embankment. However, Mr Munro stated in his evidence that the purpose of the structure constructed at Nowlands Creek was to allow vehicles to cross the creek and to control erosion in the creek. The construction is not a ""dam"" constructed and used in accordance with the harvestable rights order under section 54 of the Water Management Act. In the light of this evidence, the Prosecution submits that Schedules 1 and 2 of the Gazetted order do not apply to the construction at Nowlands Creek.

19The Defendant disagrees submitting that the charge is predicated on the construction at Nowlands Creek being a dam. Departmental officer Hanna refers to the structure being a ""dam"" as does Dr Beaman, Ms O'Reilly and the expert witness called by the Prosecution, Dr Outhet. Evidence was not led by the Prosecution as to the existence or terms of any harvestable rights order and there is no evidence as to whether the construction of the dam and/or its use fall within the terms of any harvestable rights order. Reference is made by the Prosecution to the decision of Justice Lloyd in O'Keefe v Water Management Ministerial Corporation [2010] NSWLEC 9. It is a binding and relevant authority supporting the Prosecutor's general contention but it does not apply to the case before this Court because there is no evidence about the existence of any harvestable rights order.

The Strahler System

20The method for determining the stream order of a water course is set out in Schedule 4 of the Gazetted order in 2006. It is called the Strahler system. Schedule 4 provides:

The method of determining the stream order of a watercourse shown on a topographic map is the Strahler system as shown below. The Strahler system is applied to the watercourses shown on the topographic maps as listed in Schedule 3.

For the purposes of this order, watercourses on the maps are deemed to be continuous even if they lose definition and then reappear downstream.

The Strahler system


Starting at the top of a catchment, any watercourse which has no other watercourses flowing into it is classed as a first order stream (1). 
Where two first order streams join, the stream becomes a second order stream (2). 
If a second order stream is joined by a first order stream - it remains a second order stream. 
When two second order streams join they form a third order stream (3). 
A third order stream does not become a fourth order stream until it is joined by another third order stream.
21The application of this system to Nowlands Creek was described in detail by Dr Outhet in his evidence. Its application requires reference to the topographical maps prescribed in Schedule 3 of the Gazetted order in 2006. The topographical maps of the land through which Nowlands Creek runs were tendered by the Prosecution and comprise Exhibit 2. The maps tendered were Bald Blair (1973 edition), Wards Mistake (1974 edition) and Kookabrooka (1974 edition). The Bald Blair map was the focus of the evidence given by Dr Outhet and it is referred to by Professor Taylor, an expert witness called by the defendant company.

22An important issue in this case is whether the application of the Strahler system requires ""ground truthing"". The Defendant submits that it does. Professor Taylor gives evidence that there are subsequent topographical maps of the land through which Nowlands Creek runs which do not depict as many watercourses as the 1973 edition. Further, ground truthing, which includes onsite inspections of the property, may show that a watercourse depicted on the topographical map may not be visible or even exist. The Defendant contends that the Court should adopt a purposive construction of the Gazetted order in 2006 and, ""a construction which would lead to an absurd result is not to be preferred if there are rational alternatives"". Counsel for the Defendant relied on Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 which the Court notes has been followed in by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal in RTA v Baldock [2007] NSWCCA 35 and by the Court of Appeal in DPP v Yigit [2008] NSWCA 226. It is also pertinent to note section 33 of the Interpretation. Act 1987.

23Reference is also made to the decision of the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal case of Director General Department of Land and Water Conservation v Bailey [2003] NSWCCA 361. That case refers to another principle of statutory construction. If a statutory provision creates an offence but is ambiguous, it should be interpreted narrowly and that meaning most favourable to the accused preferred. Justice Shaw made reference to a decision of the High Court of Australia in his judgment as follows:

[24] Both of the questions on the stated case raise issues of statutory construction. Neither counsel for the Director General or the defendant made submissions with reference to a suggestion made by the learned President, during argument before this Court, that penal statutes should generally be read narrowly and with ambiguity construed against the prosecution. Nevertheless, the principle should be noted. The position was stated by the High Court in R v Adams (1935) 53 CLR 563 at 567-8 as follows:

No doubt, in determining whether an offence has been created or enlarged, the Court must be guided, as in other questions of interpretation, by the fair meaning of the language of the enactment, but when that language is capable of more than one meaning, or is vague or cloudy so that its denotation is uncertain and no sure conclusion can be reached by a consideration of the provisions and subject matter of the legislation, then it ought not to be construed as extending any penal category.

See also, Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia (4th Ed, Butterworths, 1996 at 226 - 227). See also Murphy v Farmer (1988) 165 CLR 19 at 28-29.

[25] In my opinion, there would be no contradiction between an Adams construction and s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW) because to prefer the construction promoting the object and purpose of a statute is to apply it according to its terms, noting that:

If conduct of a particular kind stands outside the language of a penal section, the fact that a court takes the view that it is through inadvertence of the Legislature that it has not been included does not authorise it to assume to remedy the omission by giving the penal provision a wider scope than its language admits. Ex parte Fitzgerald; Re Gordon (1945) SR (NSW) 182 at 186 per Jordan CJ (with whom Halse Rogers and Street JJ agreed).""

24The Defendant's view is that the literal application of the language in that Gazetted order could result in an absurd consequence which bears little resemblance to reality on the ground. The Prosecution argues that the Gazetted order is the law which governs this case and it should be literally applied. The Prosecution submits and the Defendant concedes that if the Court determines that the order of stream is determined by reference purely to the maps referred to in the Gazetted order in 2006, then the Court would be satisfied that Nowlands Creek at the point where the earthen embankment was constructed is a third or higher stream order and, thus, a river. The Court's view is that the language in the order is clear. If its application produces an absurd consequence then that is a matter for the NSW Parliament to address.

Order of stream

25Applying the Strahler method and examining the relevant topographical maps Dr Beaman concluded that the stream was between a ""third and fourth order stream"" (Transcript 10/6/11 page 31). He finished by continuing that he reached his conclusion about the order of stream based on his on the ground inspection and what was on the map. He inspected the site on 1 February 2007 and was on the property for about three hours. The Wards Mistake and Kookabrooka maps highlight the movement of Nowlands Creek through the property and the other two topographical maps portray the upper catchment for Nowlands Creek.

26Ms O'Reilly referred to the four topographical maps and expressed the view that the creek was a fourth order stream or above at the point where the dam was built (Transcript 10/6/11 page 49). She gave evidence that her observations at the property were consistent with what she saw on the topographical maps.

27In submissions the Defendant points out that the departmental officers did not give evidence as experts. Only Dr Outhet and Professor Taylor were called as experts. However, all the departmental officers are experienced and qualified in their respective fields. While their opinions may not be those of expert witnesses, their observations of the property and Nowlands Creek and examination of topographical maps should not be discounted.

28On this question the answers of the experts, Dr Outhet and Professor Taylor, do vary. Dr Outhet gave evidence that Nowlands Creek was a fourth order stream. His two reports dated 20/9/10 and 12/5/11 were tendered. In evidence he explained the Strahler system. He qualifies his evidence by acknowledging that when he inspected the property in August 2008 he and Ms Hanna stopped at 18 places and checked on the ground observations against the map. There was one spot where a variation occurs from the map. He was asked to what degree is he certain that the river is a fourth order stream at the point of the dam and he answers ""Yes, I'm very certain that it's a fourth order"". This conclusion is based on his reading of the maps and visual observations (Transcript 10/6/11 page 68). He gives evidence that there was a flowing river at that point and he proffers the view that there is a permanent flow of water in the stream. In cross-examination, he conceded that there may have been 21 points along Nowlands Creek where he conducted visual observations but he adheres to his view that the stream has a permanent flow of water (Transcript 10/6/11 page 88).

29Professor Taylor challenges Dr Outhet's findings on a number of basis. His report dated 28 January 2011 was admitted into evidence. Challenges to the manner of his engagement and to his partiality were made and canvassed in submissions, but the Court views Professor Taylor as an expert but one with a different view of the proper application of the Strahler system. The Court concludes that Professor Taylor believes that ""ground truthing"" is important to the process and it is important to consider variations to topographical maps over time rather than being bound by gazetted maps which may be out of date. His approach is:
""Q. Could you please tell his Honour what you say is the appropriate way in which you would determine the order of Nowlands Creek in accordance with the Strahler method at the subject location where the crossing is:

A. Well, clearly there are two opinions in this Court and there's the legal way which is listed in the order which talks about the use of the blue lines on the map and then the subject of the papers which are appended to my report talks about the need to undertake a field investigation in order to ascertain if the blue lines on a map are in fact geo fiction or actually real features in the landscape and essentially those two articles cover the same item for different audiences one is the legal audience which is the first paper. The second one is more for geomorphologists but it takes us to the same point where we developed a test if you like a nine part test building on Knezovic v Shire Swan-Guildford decision which Barwick CJ gave which requires us to go out and look at the site and do field assessment to work out the stream order.

Q. Just pausing there, when you referred earlier to what did you refer in particular?

A. The blue lines on the map that's basically the line of a cartographer's pen and those lines may not in fact relate to anything in reality in the landscape and in order to find out whether those blue lines are actually a river or not according to the common law definitions which we have discussed in the articles which are appended to my report we have said and I have said that you go and look at the site and look for the features which indicate whether the blue line as drawn on the map is actually a river or not and if I could paraphrase what the Barwick CJ decision said he said you need bed, banks, continuity and permanence and those are the things that I have sought to look for when I've gone out and looked at streams in the field and done a site assessment along with some other items which are listed in that what I have called the nine part test.""

30At the close of his evidence, Professor Taylor says that Nowlands Creek at the point where the dam is constructed is not a fourth order stream under the Strahler system. To this extent he disagrees with Dr Outhet. He agrees with Dr Outhet that Nowlands Creek is a river. But he is critical of Dr Outhet's conclusions because too little time was devoted to ground truthing and the Doctor found a discrepancy between the position on the ground and that depicted on the geomorphological map at one of 21 points of inspection down Nowlands Creek.

31The Defendant's Counsel conceded that if ""one uses the Strahler system by lines on the map, the typographic map, one would find this to be a third - a higher than second order stream, if one uses the maps"" (Transcript 10/6/11 page 35).

32Professor Taylor agrees with Dr Outhet that at the crossing Nowlands Creek is a river in geomorphic terms (Report 28 January 2011 pages 3-4).

33He disagrees with Dr Outhet's conclusion that Nowlands Creek at the crossing is a fourth order stream because:
(a)The grid references used by Dr Outhet do not correspond with the locations referred to on the map reviewed by Professor Taylor.
(b)The more recent maps of the area do not include all the blue lines identified by Dr Outhet.
(c)More time than that spent on the property by Dr Outhet and closer examination on the ground would be required to determine the order of stream at the crossing.

34He says ""I note that Nowlands Creek at the crossing is undoubtedly a river from a geomorphic perspective in that it has beds and banks, sediment and erosion features, bedfarms and it supports aquatic habitat and species. However I am unable to say whether Nowlands Creek at the crossing is a 'river' in terms of the order, i.e. it has a stream order greater than 2"" (page 7). Attached to his report are articles about the definition of ""river"" in NSW which include an analysis of decisions about the definition and comments about the adequacy of the statutory definitions adopted in this State. The Report attaches many photographs taken while the property was inspected.

35In his earlier report dated 17 September 2010, Dr Outhet says: ""Nowlands Creek at the location of the dam is a river from a geomorphic perspective. It is a stream of water flowing in a well-defined continuous natural channel... Nowlands Creek was flowing at the time of my inspection"" (page 3 and Photograph C). He says ""if only using the blue lines on the 1:25,000 topographic maps for the catchment above the dam (Blackwater, Wards Mistake, Bald Blair, Kookabrooka) the stream order at the dam is fourth"" (page 3). The Report attaches many photographs of Nowlands Creek taken during the Doctor's inspection on 27 August 2008 and on 24 March 2009 by Ms Hanna on one of her inspections with Ms O'Reilly.

36In his response to Professor Taylor's report dated 12 May 2011, Dr Outhet reviewed the topographic maps for the Nowlands Creek dam site and upstream catchment having regard to the provisions of the Gazetted order in 2006. On review of the Kookabrooka map (1974 edition) he observes solid blue lines are used to depict Nowlands Creek which means, he says, that the map makers decided that Nowlands Creek was a river.

37He refers to the topographic maps relevant to the area where the dam was built specified in the Gazetted order which were used by him and the maps used by Professor Taylor, which are more recent. He states clearly on page 8 that stream order is to be determined in accordance with the Gazetted order and this is based on those maps specified in Schedule 3 of that order. He concedes that the map used by Professor Taylor, a Bald Blair 1988 2nd edition, depicts 22 fewer first order streams than when compared to the map Gazetted in the order which is the 1973 1st edition. He then says ""even so, the stream at the dam is still fourth order"" (page 8).

38While Dr Outhet's view is that the Gazetted order prescribes the method of determining stream orders, he concedes that there are some experts, including Professor Taylor, who say that it is necessary to engage in ground truthing to determine the real geomorphic stream order. Dr Outhet then sets out the details of the field checking he undertook with Ms Hanna on 27 August 2008. As a result he found that two of the 21 mapped order streams did not equate with his observations on the ground. The balance of the first order streams in the catchment were ""likely to be correct"" and this enabled him to state his opinion with certainty that Nowlands Creek at the dam site is not less than a third order stream (page 10). Dr Outhet then challenges some of Professor Taylor's on the ground observations for lack of specification and responds to Professor Taylor's criticism of his using wrong grid references.

Continuous flow of water

39Dr Beaman, an officer from the Department, gave evidence for the Prosecution. His report dated 17 January 2008 was tendered. He gave evidence of seeing water reticulating from the dam site to a pond near the roadside. Water was flowing from that pipe and he saw water backed up in the dam area. He observed water several hundred metres up stream and there was a ""continuous flow at the head of that body of water"" (Transcript 10/6/11 page 27). His report contains numerous photographs showing water flow

40Ms Hanna, an officer from the Department, gave evidence for the Prosecution. Her report dated 16 September 2010 was tendered. She inspected the property on 15 January 2008. She gave evidence of seeing a ""continuous"" flow of water (Transcript 10/6/11 page 39). A further inspection was conducted on 1 December 2009 with Ms O'Reilly. She gave evidence of seeing water from the dam down to a bridge where both were located. The flow was described as ""continuous"" at the bridge. A further inspection was conducted on 20 July 2010 and a ""flow of water"" was observed. ""I could see water on the by-wash and it was flowing down at the bridge"" (Transcript 10/6/11 page 41). She described the flow as ""continuous"". In cross-examination about the inspections, she gave evidence of seeing ""a permanent flow in that creek"". On 27 August 2008 Ms Hanna attended the property with Dr David Outhet. She observed water flow which is evidenced by photographs taken on that day.

41Ms O'Reilly, an officer of the Department, gave evidence for the Prosecution. She gave evidence of using the Strahler system regularly. Her statement dated 17 September 2010 was tendered. She visited the property on 6 August 2008 with Ms Hanna. She observed the dam across Nowlands Creek. Water was being ""backed up or impounded"" behind the dam wall. She saw a wash or spillway to the side of the dam. She walked downstream of the dam wall to the bridge. She gives evidence of seeing water ""flowing into the impounded water behind the dam wall from upstream ... going through... the by-wash on the causeway flowing downstream and adjoining the creek near Nowlands Bridge and it was flowing consistently from upstream through the dam and downstream"" (Transcript 10/6/11 page 51). She said it was a permanent flow of water. On 24 March 2009 she again saw a constant or continuous flow of water from upstream and downstream which appeared to her to be ""permanent"". Photographs supporting this observation were taken. On 1 December 2009 she observed water flowing continuously at the bridge and it appeared to be of a permanent nature. In cross-examination she gave evidence of the durations of the inspections and confirmed that her observations about continuous and permanent flow of water were based on those inspections.

42Boyd Munro has owned, through his company, Wards Mistake for 30 years and during that time he has spent around two months each year on the property. He gave evidence about the reasons why and purpose for construction of the dam across Nowlands Creek and of a number of other matters. Relevantly he gave evidence that on more than 30 occasions over the years he observed no flow of water in Nowlands Creek. He was extensively cross-examined about this evidence. It emerged that Mr Munro was not able to recall the times or locations where these observations were made and that he did not have an operative water gauge operating to measure water flow in the creek. He conceded that the water flowed down the creek more often than not and the flow was described as regular. In the Court's view Mr Munro was a witness of credit and his failure to recall details over such a lengthy period of time is understandable. He proffered evidence that there had been eels and fish in the creek and he wished to encourage their habitat. The Prosecutor in submissions referred to phrases and words used by Mr Munro in evidence, records of interview and correspondence about the creek suggestive of a view that it was a river but the Court does not regard those references as assisting to determine material facts in issue.

43A number of different witnesses have observed the creek at different times over four years. At those times they saw either a continuous or permanent flow of water in the creek or at and around the point where the dam was constructed. Against their evidence Mr Munro gives evidence that he has seen no water flow in the creek more than 30 times over 30 years. Professor Taylor did not observe a flow of water on at least one occasion.

Q. Now what do you say to the proposition that the Nowlands Creek at the location of the subject crossing maintains a permanent flow of water being a visible flow which occurs on a continuous basis?

A. Well I've only been there three times in my life. The last time was yesterday. But I do believe in my visit - on my visit in 2009 that I did see no water passing between the upstream area of the crossing and the downstream area of the crossing. However in order to understand this question, has there been permanent flow at a site, one would need to have been to that site a reasonable - spend a reasonable amount of time in that site in order to understand the variation that occurs over time as a result of the variation in climate that this part of the world receives. So what I'm trying to say is, if one just goes once or twice and sees permanent flow at a site, I think it is very difficult, it's a very - you're drawing a very long bow between two visits and then saying, well I've been there twice and there's always been water there, therefore there must be permanent water there at all times under all conditions. That's an extremely long bow.

Decision

44The Prosecution has the onus of proving that Nowlands Creek was a river at the point where the construction was located. The evidence of Mr Munro and Professor Taylor casts reasonable doubt on whether the Court could find to the requisite standard that there was a continuous and permanent flow of water at that point, given those words have their normal and literal meaning. While there is some criticism of Dr Outhet's evidence and a problem identified by him when ground truthing the creek at one of 21 locations, his evidence is solid. Professor Taylor is unable to refute Dr Outhet's ultimate conclusion that the creek is a third order stream but he disputes the finding it is a fourth order stream. Dr Outhet's evidence on the stream order of Nowlands Creek is supported by experienced and trained officers from the Department.

45The Prosecution's submission is that it has proved that Nowlands Creek at the point where the earthen dam was constructed was a river. Essentially under the definition in section 5 of the Water Act 1912 the Prosecution needs to prove that there was ""a stream of water whether perennial or intermittent flowing in a natural channel, or in a natural channel artificially improved, or in an artificial channel which has changed the course of the stream"". The submission refers to the evidence about water flow in the creek over a period of four years from February 2007 to January 2011. The direction issued pursuant to section 21B(1)(b) of the Act was dated 2008 and the failure by the Defendant company to comply with that direction results in the date of the offence being late December 2008.

46The evidence is of water flowing in a natural channel, or an artificial channel. The evidence of Department officer, Ms O'Reilly, observed a ""wash or spill way to the side of the dam flowing downstream and rejoining the creek"". This probably constitutes an artificial channel which has changed the course of the stream. Other evidence would tend to prove that the creek has a natural channel up and downstream aside from where the dam is constructed. The photographs tendered support this finding.

47The next question is whether there was a ""stream of water, whether perennial or intermittent"". At the hearing the focus of questions put to witnesses was on whether the flow of water observed was continuous or permanent rather than perennial or intermittent. Various inquiries about the meaning of the words used in the definitions in the Water Act 1912 have been made. Justice Lloyd in O'Keefe v Water Administration Ministerial Corporation [2010] NSWLEC9 referred to definitions given to these words by experts called in the case. Those experts included Dr Outhet. The terms and words are not defined in the legislation. Dictionary definitions are relevant.

48In the Macquarie Concise Dictionary 3rd Edition:
""continuous"" is defined: ""having the parts in immediate connection, unbroken... uninterrupted in time, without cessation"".
""intermittent"" is defined: ""that intermits or ceases for a time .... Alternately ceasing and beginning again... (of streams, lakes or springs) recurrent, showing water only part of the time"".
""perennial"" is defined: ""lasting for an indefinitely long time; enduring... lasting or continuing throughout the year, as a stream... perpetual, everlasting; continuing; recurrent"".
""permanent"" is defined: ""lasting or intended to last indefinitely; remaining unchanged; not temporary; enduring; abiding"".

49On the basis of these dictionary definitions, the evidence about Nowlands Creek would not support the finding that the stream of water was ""perennial"", ""permanent"" or ""continuous"" but a finding is open that the flow is ""intermittent"". If this view is correct then the Prosecution has proved that Nowlands Creek at the place where the dam was constructed is a ""river"" and the Court could find that the construction was a ""work to which this part extends"" as defined in section 5 of the Act. Such a finding is vital to the validity of the Direction, the breach of which led to the charge.

50The Court's view is that the Prosecution has proved its case on one of two bases. Firstly, Nowlands Creek at the point where the earthen dam was constructed is at least a third order stream and, accordingly, it is a river. In the alternative Nowlands Creek at the point where the earthen dam was constructed is a river because the evidence shows that the creek has an intermittent flow of water. Given the material facts admitted by the Defendant company and that the Prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Nowlands Creek at the point where the earthen dam was constructed is a river, the offence has been proved.

2416393,Milne v R [2012] NSWCCA 24,"Judgment 

1THE COURT : In November 2010, the appellant was found guilty by a jury in the Supreme Court on one count of ""money laundering"", contrary to s 400.3(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (""the Code""), and one count of doing an act with the intention of dishonestly obtaining a gain from the Commonwealth, contrary to s 135.1(1) of the Code. 

2On 17 December 2010, Johnson J (the trial judge) imposed the following sentences on the appellant: 

(a) In relation to the conviction for money laundering, contrary to s 400.3(1) of the Code, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 7 years, to date from 17 December 2010 and to expire on 16 December 2017. 

(b) In relation to the conviction of doing an act with the intention of dishonestly obtaining a gain from the Commonwealth, contrary to s 135.1(1) of the Code, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 3 years and 6 months, to date from 17 December 2015 and to expire on 16 June 2019. 

(c) In relation to both sentences, his Honour fixed a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months to date from 17 December 2010 and to expire on 16 September 2015. 

3By Notice of Appeal filed on 6 April 2011, the appellant appeals against both convictions and seeks leave to appeal against sentence. For convenience, we shall describe him as ""the appellant"" in relation to both the conviction appeal and the sentence appeal. 

An overview 

4It will be necessary in due course to state with some particularity the facts relating to the transactions and events underlining the jury's verdict and the trial judge's remarks on sentence. For the moment, however, we shall briefly state the nature of the case. Essentially, the Crown case was that the appellant had acquired through his private company, Barat Advisory Pty Ltd, a significant parcel of shares in a company, Admerex Limited (""Admerex""), at negligible cost. Thereafter, he took advice and proceeded to establish tax-deferral arrangements involving overseas entities through which, ultimately, the shares were disposed. The short term feature of the arrangements was the necessity to pass the legal and beneficial ownership to the overseas entities. A critical dealing in the shares was the later ""swap"" of some 48 million Admerex shares for 1 million Temenos shares. The Crown alleged that the appellant, prior to the swap, had in a number of respects deliberately and significantly departed from the terms of the tax advice he had been given and the structure which had been established by his lawyers. He did so with the ultimate intention of avoiding the payment of capital gains tax liabilities that might later arise. In particular, it was the Crown case that Barat Advisory Pty Ltd retained the beneficial ownership of the shares. When the opportunity ultimately arose to dispose of the Admerex shares, once again, the appellant did so, contrary to the terms of the tax advice and with the same intention of avoiding Capital Gains Tax (CGT). The structure of, and the dealings involved in, these transactions were complex. Relevant transactions occurred both in Australia and overseas between January 2003 and September 2005. It was the Crown case that the CGT liability arose in the 2005 financial year. The Admerex shares, on the Crown case, were critical to the exercise. The appellant's activities relating to the shares were critical to an assessment of the appellant's intentions. These circumstances constituted the money laundering offence. 

5The appellant had a number of dealings with his accountants in the process of producing the accounts and income tax return for Barat Advisory Pty Ltd. These dealings traversed the period between May 2005 and November 2006. The 2005 tax return was lodged on or about 13 November 2006. The Crown case was that the appellant, in this tax return, intentionally omitted the true CGT position, with the consequence that tax was avoided in an amount somewhere between $1.9 million and $2.4 million. Further, it was alleged the appellant had deceived and misled his accountants in a number of respects. These were the circumstances relating to the second charge in the indictment. 

The Indictment 

6The Indictment contained the following counts: 

(a) Count 1 - Between about 30 April 2004 and about 30 September 2005 at Sydney in the state of New South Wales and elsewhere [the appellant] dealt with property, intending that the property, namely a parcel of shares, would become an instrument of crime, in that it would be used to facilitate the commission of an offence by Barat Advisory Pty Ltd and at the time of the dealing, the value of the property was $1 million or more (s 400.3(1) Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) - maximum penalty - 25 years imprisonment); 

(b) Count 2 - On or about 13 November 2006 at Sydney in the state of New South Wales [the appellant] did, with the intention of dishonestly obtaining a gain from the Commonwealth, caused to be lodged an income tax return in the name of Barat Advisory Pty Ltd for the year ending 30 June 2005 containing false information, namely that the net capital gain from the sale of the shares in Admerex was $4,597 (s 135.1(1) Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) - maximum penalty - 5 years imprisonment). 

Crown Case Statement 

7The Crown Case Statement set out, in some considerable detail, the factual matters that it asserted would be proved at trial. In addition, it stated succinctly the way in which it would suggest those facts should be applied to each of the counts in the Indictment. As to the money laundering count, the Crown Case Statement (paragraphs 165-172) (with footnotes and evidentiary references omitted) stated: 

165. Count 1 avers that, contrary to section 400.3(1) of the Criminal Code, [the appellant] between about 30 April 2004 and about 30 September 2005 at Sydney in the state of New South Wales and elsewhere dealt with property, intending that the property, namely a parcel of shares, would become an instrument of crime, in that it would be used to facilitate the commission of an offence by Barat Advisory Pty Ltd and at the time of the dealing, the value of the property was $1 million or more. 

[ The appellant] dealt with property 

166. On or around 3 February [the appellant] dealt with property, namely the 48 million Admerex shares, when on behalf of Barat Advisory he disposed of those shares by exchanging them for 1 million Temenos shares. 

Intending that the property would become an instrument of crime 

167. The Admerex shares remained under the beneficial ownership and effective control of Barat Advisory through the accused, after they were purportedly transferred into the Stichting Group companies on or around 11 June 2004. At the time of that purported transfer, and subsequently, [the appellant] intended to use the Stichting groups to conceal the disposal of the Admerex shares, and the proceeds of such disposal, in order to avoid the payment by Barat Advisory of Capital Gains Tax. 

168. When the 48 million Admerex shares were disposed of on 3 February 2005, by exchanging them for 1 million Temenos shares, [the appellant] intended to avoid the payment by Barat Advisory of tax on the capital gain which was derived as a result of that disposal. For that purpose, [the appellant] used the Stichting groups to conceal the disposal of the 48 million Admerex shares and the proceeds of that disposal. 

169. As such, [the appellant] intended that the 48 million Admerex shares would be used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence that may be dealt with as a Commonwealth indictable offence, namely the obtaining by Barat Advisory of a financial advantage by deception, contrary to section 134.2 of the Criminal Code. 

170. On this basis [the appellant] intended that the 48 million Admerex shares would become an instrument of crime. 

At the time of the dealing the value of the property was $1 million or more 

171. When the 48 million Admerex shares were disposed of on 3 February 2005, by exchanging them for 1 million Temenos shares, they were valued on the Australian Stock Exchange at between $8.4 million and $9.120 million. 

172. Alternatively, when they were disposed of on 3 February 2005, the 48 million Admerex shares were valued at between $8.480 million and $9,494,012.30 being the value of the 1 million Temenos shares for which they were exchanged. 

8In relation to Count 2, the Crown sought to apply the facts in the Crown Case Statement to the elements of the dishonest obtaining offence as follows: 

174. On or about 13 November 2006 [the appellant] caused to be lodged an income tax return in the name of Barat Advisory for the financial year ending 30 June 2005. 

175. That tax return contained false information, namely that the net capital gain in the financial year ended 30 June 2005 when the sale of share in Admerex was $4,597. This information was false because Barat Advisory derived a net capital gain of between $6.560 million and $7.574 million from the disposal of the 48 million Admerex shares on or around 3 February 2005. 

With the intention of dishonestly obtaining a gain from the Commonwealth 

176. [The appellant] intended to obtain a gain for Barat Advisory from the Commonwealth, namely, keeping the capital gain derived from the disposal of the 48 million Admerex shares and avoiding the payment of tax on that capital gain. 

177. The intention of [the appellant] was dishonest because: 

(i) [The appellant] was aware that tax was payable on any capital gain derived from the disposal by Barat Advisory of the Admerex shares, including the 48 million Admerex shares; and 

(ii) [The appellant] used the Stichting groups to conceal the disposal of the Admerex shares, including the 48 million Admerex shares, and the proceeds of such disposal, in order to avoid the payment by Barat Advisory of tax on any such capital gain. 

Outline of Crown case 

9We shall provide a more detailed outline of the Crown case at this stage. The trial judge, in a lengthy and comprehensive exercise, detailed the facts in his remarks on sentence. That section of the sentencing decision encompassed some 43 pages of closely expressed factual material. The present outline will not descend to that detail. Where it is necessary for us to refer to more detail, having regard to the particular grounds of appeal relied on, we shall do so at a later stage. 

10It is convenient to start in 2003. On or around 16 January 2003, the appellant entered into a Mandate Agreement with Sinitus Treuhand AG (""Sinitus"") concerning Clairmont Holdings and Finance Limited (""Clairmont Holdings and Finance""). 

11Sinitus was a Swiss financial services company. Urs Meisterhans was a partner at Sinitus. Mr Meisterhans became a significant participant in events connected to the offences. Clairmont Holdings and Finance was a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. 

12The Mandate Agreement provided that, in return for a fee to be paid by the appellant, Sinitus would act as directors and/or officers of Clairmont Holdings and Finance, and would act exclusively on instructions received from the appellant or his attorney. On this basis, the appellant controlled Clairmont Holdings and Finance. There was thus a history of Mr Meisterhans receiving instructions from the appellant and acting on those instructions. 

13In or around May 2003, the appellant was introduced to Kim Goodall. Mr Goodall became a significant witness for the prosecution at trial, although his credit and reliability was attacked by the appellant. Mr Goodall had previously been involved in a Swiss software development company known as Temenos Group AG (""Temenos""). 

14In 2003, the appellant encountered a situation which was to lead to what the trial judge later described as a ""windfall"". As at 21 May 2003, Global Technology Limited (""GTL"") was owed a debt of approximately $11 million (later found to be closer to $8 million) by Global Technology Australasia Limited (""GTAL""). GTL was a company registered in South Africa and was the holding company of GTAL, which was a publicly listed company registered in Australia. GTAL had no funds to pay the debt. As part of a complex series of negotiations, on 21 May 2003, GTL and Clairmont Holdings and Finance signed a Debt Assignment Agreement. 

15Pursuant to this agreement, GTL sold the debt to Clairmont Holdings and Finance for $1, payable if and when demanded. Consequently, GTAL owed a debt of approximately $11 million (later found to be closer to $8 million) to Clairmont Holdings and Finance. The appellant, in July 2003, was appointed as an Executive Director and Acting Chief Executive Officer of GTAL and its subsidiaries. On 10 July 2003, GTAL changed its name to Admerex Limited. 

16On 15 August 2003, on instructions from the appellant, Barat Advisory Pty Ltd (""Barat Advisory"") was registered with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. From the time of its incorporation, the appellant has been the sole director and shareholder of Barat Advisory. It was accepted that, at all relevant times, the appellant was the controlling mind of Barat Advisory. 

17In or around October 2003, the appellant and Mr Goodall decided to acquire approximately $7.9 million of the debt owed by Admerex to Clairmont Holdings and Finance. On 18 November 2003, Clairmont Holdings and Finance sold $2,236,459 of the debt owed to it by Admerex to Barat Advisory. In consideration for obtaining the debt owed to it by Admerex in the sum of $2,236,459, Barat Advisory was required to pay $1.5 million to Clairmont Holdings by 20 November 2003. 

18Barat Advisory did not pay the $1.5 million it owed to Clairmont Holdings and Finance as consideration for its acquisition of the relevant part of the debt owed by Admerex. 

19On 18 November 2003, Clairmont Holdings and Finance sold $5,665,692 of the debt owed to it by Admerex to Atticus Investments Inc (""Atticus""), a company operated by Mr Goodall. Similarly, this debt was part of the debt acquired by Clairmont Holdings and Finance on 21 May 2003, before GTAL changed its name to Admerex. Atticus was required to pay $3.8 million to Clairmont Holdings and Finance by 20 November 2003, and such a payment was made on or around 20 November 2003. 

20On 24 November 2003, Mr Goodall was appointed as Director of Admerex, and he continued thereafter to be a Director of Admerex. 

21On 19 December 2003, Barat Advisory opened a bank account with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (the Barat Advisory CBA account). This bank account was opened at the direction of the appellant. Barat Advisory operated this account during the period from 19 December 2003 until 19 November 2007. The appellant was the only person authorised to operate the account. Barat Advisory also operated a second bank account with St George Bank (the Barat Advisory St George account). 

22On 30 April 2004, allotments of shares in Admerex were made to both Barat Advisory and to Atticus to repay the debts owed by Admerex respectively to Barat Advisory and Atticus. 

23In the case of Barat Advisory, an allotment of 55,911,475 shares in Admerex was issued at a value of 4 cents per share. It was this parcel of shares that became the focus of the prosecution case in relation to Count 1 and indirectly to Count 2 in the indictment. 

24The issue of Admerex shares on 30 April 2004, in order to repay the debts owed by Admerex to Barat Advisory and Atticus, was the subject of an independent expert's report, which concluded that the issue of shares was fair and reasonable to other Admerex shareholders and was approved at an Annual General Meeting of Admerex shareholders on 30 April 2004. 

25On 7 January 2005, the appellant resigned as a Director of Admerex. 

26The Crown case was that the appellant now found himself in a position whereby his company, Barat Advisory, had acquired an asset in the form of the Admerex shares with the value of at least $2.2 million in circumstances where Clairmont Holdings and Finance, which was also controlled by the appellant, had acquired the original asset, being the debt of approximately $11 million (later to be assessed at $8 million) at a cost of $1. It was the Crown case that the appellant was, by this fortunate situation, now confronted with the problem of determining how to realise the profit from those transactions without having the proceeds substantially diminished by an obligation to pay tax, particularly CGT. 

27The Crown case was that, with these concerns in mind, the appellant approached Anne Harley, a solicitor and partner at Atanaskovic Hartnell, who had considerable experience in taxation law. The appellant had met Ms Harley in 2000, and she had provided professional advice to him from time to time thereafter. Ms Harley was a Crown witness at the trial. The appellant sought advice from her as to how the 55 million Admerex shares could be placed within a structure to facilitate the sale of those shares to offshore investors. There were tax advantages involved in the discussions. 

28In response to the appellant's request for advice, Ms Harley developed an offshore structure which used offshore companies and entities known under Dutch law as ""Stichtings"". Ms Harley had previously used a Stichting Group structure for another client. 

29The offshore structure developed by Ms Harley consisted of 5 Stichting and 5 offshore companies (""the Stichting Group""). 

30The 5 Stichtings established by Ms Harley were known, respectively, as: 
(a) Stichting Black; 
(b) Stichting Adelaar; 
(c) Stichting Badinage; 
(e) Stichting Wijsheid; and 
(d) Stichting Aurelius 

31These 5 Stichtings were established on 11 June 2004, and were administered on behalf of the appellant by a Dutch administration services company known as Citco Nederland BV (""Citco""). 

32The offshore companies were: 
(a) Challinor Equities Limited; 
(b) Schlossman Partners Limited; 
(c) Thouvanel Investments (Asia Pacific) Limited; 
(d) Metevier Securities International Limited; and 
(e) Vaillendourf Europe Limited. 

33These companies were incorporated in St Vincent and the Grenadines by Mr Meisterhans, at the request of Ms Harley, on 3 June 2004. Mr Meisterhans was appointed as a Director of each of these companies. 

34Each Stichting was the sole shareholder of one of the offshore companies. Each Stichting Group was in similar form, and was established by documentation which was essentially the same in content and purpose. The documentation in each case included a Master Investment Futures Agreement and Form of Confirmation between the appellant and each Stichting. The termination date in each case was 1 July 2005, although it was anticipated, as part of the structure, that the termination date would be extended for a further period or periods, not exceeding 10 years. 

35Under this Agreement, on 1 March of each year until the termination date, the appellant was obliged to pay the Stichting the shortfall, if any, between the dividend paid or payable by the relevant company to the Stichting in respect of the financial year immediately preceding that date, and the amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the committed capital of the company. As the committed capital of each Stichting, however, was US$100, the appellant's maximum exposure in respect of each annual payment, and the ultimate termination payment, was US$10. The appellant was not entitled to any payment by the Stichting or the company, and was not entitled to any of the assets of the Stichting or the company, until after the termination date. 

36There was also a Deed of Charge in each case, dated 11 June 2004. This was a deed made between the appellant and the relevant Stichting. Under this Deed of Charge, the Stichting could not deal with, sell or otherwise dispose or part with possession of the shares it held in the company, unless it had prior written consent of the appellant. There were other restrictions as well. 

37It appears that, in the period between May and August 2004, Ms Harley explained to the appellant, both orally and in writing, that: 

(a) There would be tax payable on the initial disposal of the shares, but during the term of the arrangement there would be no tax liability. 

(b) The appellant would not be entitled to the benefits of the assets of the Stichting Group until after the termination of the Stichting Group structure. (It appears the structure was intended to have an overall life of about ten years). 

(c) For both company law and taxation purposes, neither the Stichtings nor the companies were associated. 

(d) None of the Stichting Group companies were required to lodge a substantial shareholder notice and subsequent disposal of Admerex shares by the Stichting Group companies would, so long as Admerex remained listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, be free of CGT. 

(e) Any payment the appellant would receive upon the termination of the Stichting Group structure would be subject to CGT in Australia if that payment represented a capital gain on the value of the assets which had been held in that Stichting group; and 

(f) The Stiching group companies were required to act independently of the appellant and independently of one another. His only interest would be financial and protected by the documentation, especially the Deeds of Charge. 

38On or around 11 June 2004, the appellant signed a document in relation to each of the 5 Stichtings, entitled ""Declaration of Source of Funds"". This identified the appellant to be the beneficial owner of funds used to establish the Stichtings, and of any funds which might from time to time be transferred into the names of the Stichtings. The appellant was also identified as the beneficial owner of assets in documentation which opened accounts, on or around 15 June 2004, in the name of each of the Stichting Group companies. These accounts were with a Swiss bank known as EFG Bank AG (""EFG Bank""). These accounts were opened by Mr Meisterhans, who was also nominated as the sole signatory in relation to each of the accounts. 

39One of the critical issues at trial was whether, when the 55 million Admerex shares were transferred to the Stichting Group, Barat Advisory (with the appellant as its controlling mind) retained beneficial ownership of them. The documentation to which we have referred in the last paragraph was clearly evidence that pointed in that direction. Ms Harley, however, gave evidence that, in her opinion, the appellant had no such beneficial ownership and that the documentation which identified the appellant as the beneficial owner was only provided at the insistence of Citco and EFG Bank. In his remarks on sentence, the trial judge indicated that the guilty verdicts demonstrated that the jury must have been satisfied in relation to this issue. In other words, the jury must have been satisfied that, contrary to Ms Harley's opinion, Barat Advisory retained the beneficial interest in the 55 million Admerex shares after the legal title was transferred to the Stichting Group companies on or around 11 June 2004. As we have said, this was a critical issue at trial and it has become a critical ground of appeal in these proceedings. 

40On 11 June 2004, the appellant signed 5 documents entitled, ""Standard Transfer Form for Non-Market Transactions"" on behalf of Barat Advisory. These documents were evidence that, on that day, Barat Advisory transferred the 55 million Admerex shares to the 5 Stichting Group companies in 5 parcels of shares at a value of 5 cents per share. The total stated consideration for these 5 parcels of shares (comprising in all the 55 million Admerex shares) was $2,795,573.75. 

41Following the transfers, the appellant signed a document which stated that he had disposed of his indirect interest as the sole shareholder of Barat Advisory in the 55 million Admerex shares. Similarly, on 15 June 2004, he signed a ""Notice of Ceasing to be a Substantial Shareholder"". 

42The appellant gave instructions to the Company Secretary of Admerex for the placement of the 55 million shares with ANZ Nominees. They were to be held on behalf of the 5 Stichting Group companies in an ANZ Nominees account operated by EFG Bank. These instructions were followed. 

43There was evidence at trial that the appellant, in June 2004, told Mr Goodall that he had sold the 55 million Admerex shares to give himself a tax position in Australia; that CGT would be payable on that disposal, but that he did not have a tax liability on any further increases in the value of the Admerex shares. 

44The financial statements for Barat Advisory for the financial years ending 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2005 did not record any debt owed to Barat Advisory by any of the Stichting Group companies for the transfer of the 55 million Admerex shares. Similarly, the Barat Advisory CBA account statements did not show any payment to Barat Advisory by any of the Stichting Group companies in respect of the transfer of the shares. A similar position applied to the statements for the St George account. 

45Contrary to the terms that governed the Stichting group, as they had been established by Ms Harley, there was no dividend paid by any of the Stichting group companies to any of the Stichtings. Similarly, the appellant did not make any annual payment to any of the Stichtings representing the shortfall between the dividend paid, or payable, by any of the Stichting Group companies and the amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the committed capital of any of the Stichting Group companies. Nor was there any payment made on the termination date. 

46During 2004, Admerex began to explore a capital raising transaction involving a Swiss Bank known as ""SwissFirst Bank AG"" (""SwissFirst Bank""). Earlier that year, in April 2004, Admerex (Ireland) Limited (""Admerex (Ireland)"") was incorporated in Ireland. The appellant was appointed as one of the Directors of this company. The capital raising transaction envisaged required Admerex (Ireland) to provide to SwissFirst Bank 5 million shares in Temenos. These shares were owned by Mr Goodall and were to be provided by Admerex (Ireland) as security to SwissFirst Bank. 

47On 8 December 2004, Mr Goodall gave instructions for 5 million Temenos shares, owned by him, to be transferred to SwissFirst Bank as security for a loan by SwissFirst Bank to Admerex (Ireland) in accordance with the terms of the proposed capital raising transaction. There was a Letter of Intent entered into between Admerex and SwissFirst Bank which confirmed the terms of the venture. A bridge loan was contemplated to be secured by 5 million Temenos shares, owned by Mr Goodall, to be assigned and transferred to SwissFirst Bank by Admerex (Ireland). 

48On or around 24 December 2004, 5 million Temenos shares owned by Mr Goodall were transferred to SwissFirst Bank as security for the bridge loan to Admerex (Ireland) in accordance with the Letter of Intent. The shares were placed in a SwissFirst Bank holding account. On a cost-price basis, the value of the 5 million Temenos shares at that time was approximately equivalent to $53,550,000.00. 

49On or around 27 December 2004, the SwissFirst bank account in the name of Admerex (Ireland) had as its signatories the appellant and Mr Meisterhans. 

50On 30 January 2005, the appellant travelled into Switzerland on behalf of Admerex and Admerex (Ireland) to renegotiate with SwissFirst Bank the capital raising transaction described in the Letter of Intent. On or around 2 February 2005, while he was in Switzerland, the appellant telephoned Mr Goodall from Zurich. The appellant told Mr Goodall that the capital-raising deal was to be changed, and that the security provided by Admerex (Ireland) would only need to be 3 million Temenos shares, not the 5 million Temenos shares as had been previously required under the Letter of Intent. 

51During the same telephone conversation, the appellant told Mr Goodall that Mr Goodall would get a million Temenos shares back, and said he (the appellant) would take a million Temenos shares for 49 million Admerex shares. Mr Goodall replied, ""OK, the deal needs to be renegotiated and we will discuss it when we get back"". This, the trial judge found, was the share swap which, according to the jury's verdict, constituted a contract for the disposal of at least 48 million Admerex shares. It was this transaction that precipitated a CGT event. 

52Thereafter, the appellant (with the aid of Mr Meisterhans), acted promptly in a manner consistent with there being such an arrangement, with sale transactions occurring concerning the 1 million Temenos shares, and funds thereafter being directed for the appellant's use. 

53On 2 February 2005, Admerex (Ireland) and SwissFirst Bank agreed to terminate the Letter of Intent. The agreement to terminate was signed by the appellant, on behalf of Admerex (Ireland) and was authorised by Mr Goodall. On the same day, Admerex (Ireland) sent a security delivery order which instructed SwissFirst Bank to transfer 1 million Temenos shares to a safe custody account with SwissFirst Bank in the name of Challinor Equities. Mr Meisterhans wrote to SwissFirst Bank on the same day, directing that the account was to be opened so that it could hold the 1 million Temenos shares which were to be transferred by the bank to Challinor Equities. 

54On 2 February 2005, account number 6048 was opened at SwissFirst Bank in the name of Challinor Equities. Mr Meisterhans was nominated as one of the authorised signatories to the account, together with two other Directors of Sinitus. The appellant was identified as the beneficial owner of the assets held in the Challinor Equities SwissFirst Bank account, but was not nominated as a signatory to the account. 

55On 3 February 2005, SwissFirst Bank confirmed that, as instructed by Mr Meisterhans, it had transferred 1 million Temenos shares from SwissFirst Bank account number 7900 into the Challinor Equities SwissFirst Bank account. In addition to the 1 million Temenos shares transferred to the Challinor Equities account, a further 1 million shares was transferred to EFG Bank, to be held on behalf of Mr Goodall. 

56The SwissFirst Bank transfer documentation indicated that the cost-price of the Temenos shares was CHF9.4 per share, as at the time they were placed into the Challinor Equities SwissFirst Bank account. On this basis, in Australian dollar terms, the cost-price of the 1 million Temenos shares was equivalent to approximately $10,141,331.00 as at 3 February 2005. However, the account opening documentation for the Challinor Equities SwissFirst Bank account stated that the starting inventory for the account was 1 million Temenos shares valued at CHF8.8 million. On this basis, the value of the 1 million Temenos shares was equivalent to $9,494,012.30 as at 3 February 2005. 

57On 3 February 2005, Temenos shares were traded on the Swiss Stock Exchange at a value between CHF7.85 and CHF8.09 per share. On this basis, 1 million Temenos shares were valued on the Swiss Stock Exchange at the equivalent of between approximately $8,469,090.00 and $8,728,018.00 on that date. 

58In exchange for the transfer on 3 February 2005 of the 1 million Temenos shares into the Challinor Equities SwissFirst Bank account, the appellant arranged for 48 million Admerex shares to be held, on behalf of Mr Goodall, in accounts in the name of Stichting Group companies, as follows: 

(a) 11,900,000 Admerex shares were held by ANZ Nominees on behalf of the Schlossman Partners EFG Bank account; 

(b) 11,500,000 Admerex shares were held by ANZ Nominees on behalf of the Thouvanel Investments EFG Bank account; 

(c) 13,500,000 Admerex shares were held by ANZ Nominees on behalf of the Metevier Securities EFG Bank account; and 

(d) 11,100,000 Admerex shares were held by ANZ Nominees on behalf of the Vaillendourf Europe EFG Bank account. 

59On 3 February 2005, Admerex shares traded on the Australian Stock Exchange at a value of between 17.5 cents and 19 cents per share. On this basis, the 48 million Admerex shares were valued on the Australian Stock Exchange at between $8,400,000.00 and $9,120,000.00 as at 3 February 2005. 

60The Admerex shares transferred on 3 February 2005 to the Stichting Group companies on behalf of Mr Goodall remained in that situation until later in 2005. On or around 14 September 2005, arrangements were made for the 48 million Admerex shares to be transferred so that they were held on behalf of a third party. These arrangements were carried out by Mr Mehm of EFG Bank on instructions from Mr Goodall. 

61During the period 3 February 2005 until about mid June 2005, the 1 million Temenos shares in account 6048 were disposed of and funds were deposited to the Challinor Equities SwissFirst Bank account. On the case presented by the Crown, about 8 million Swiss Francs were generated by the sale of the shares. The value of the shares, by reference to their market value on the Australian Stock Exchange throughout that period, was between $8.4 million to $9.1 million, depending on the precise fluctuation of the share price at any given time. 

62The Crown case at trial was that the appellant established the Stichting Group arrangement for the purpose of giving the appearance that he had caused Barat Advisory to divest itself of the Admerex shares to a group of entities which were independent and at arm's length, when in fact, at all material times, the appellant continued to exercise effective control over the shares and the proceeds of their disposal, sometimes for his own personal use. The Crown case was that, in disregard of the terms governing the conduct of the Stichting Group, the proceeds of the share trading following the swap were then distributed. A total of approximately $5.6 million was transferred in the period from March 2005 to January 2006, to the Barat Advisory CBA account. Amounts from the proceeds of the sale of the shares were allegedly used for the personal benefit of the appellant, including a house purchase, the purchase of a yacht, jewellery, a luxury vehicle and artworks. The full details of these numerous transactions are to be found in the remarks on sentence, paragraphs [102]-[128]. The total of the transfer of funds from Challinor Equities to Barat Advisory was $5.6 million. The total of the deposits which were consequently received into the Barat Advisory CBA account was $5,599,902.61 (being $5.6 million, less bank transfer fees). 

63The trial judge meticulously listed the following assets as having been purchased, or partly purchased, with the proceeds of the sale of the 1 million Temenos shares deposited into the Challinor Equities SwissFirst Bank account: 

(a) a painting from Art et Antiquites, Paris, for an amount of €160,000; 

(b) deposit in the amount of $200,000 for the purchase by the appellant's wife of a residential property in Neutral Bay for $4.7 million; 

(c) purchase on or around 11 March 2005 by Barat Advisory of the yacht known as 'Black Snake' for the amou nt of $270,000; 

(d) stamp duty in the amount of $269,492 for the purchase of the Neutral Bay property; 

(e) purchase of jewellery for $100,000 by Barat Advisory; 

(f) payment of $454,052.94 to repay an overdraft with St George Bank fixed rate loan account in the name of the appellant; 

(g) payment of $1,526,235.77 to repay an overdraft with St George Bank in the name of the appellant; 

(h) deposit of $409,743.73 into St George Bank call deposit account in the name of the appellant (to meet conditions of fi nance to be provided by St George Bank for the purchase of the Neutral Bay property);

(l) payment of $71,534.61 by Barat Advisory in connection with acquisition of a 2005 Bentley motor vehicle. 

64We turn now to consider the facts relating directly to the second count in the Indictment. This narrative begins in May 2005 when the appellant became a client of Grant Thornton Accountants. The firm was retained to prepare financial statements and tax returns for Barat Advisory for 2004, 2005 and 2006. Instructions were also given that outstanding tax returns for the appellant himself should be prepared. 

65The gist of the Crown case in relation to the second count in the Indictment was that the appellant deliberately and dishonestly failed to tell Grant Thornton Accountants the truth concerning the share swap on or around 3 February 2005, and failed to make honest disclosure of the substantial capital gain which had flowed to Barat Advisory as a result of the share swap. 

66On 27 May 2005, the appellant met with Mr William Shew, a Director of Grant Thornton. The appellant told Mr Shew that assets, including art (referred to as the 'Clairmont Collection') were funded by loans from Clairmont, which were secured over the residential property at Neutral Bay, with interest capitalising at 3.5% to be repaid from capital growth on that property. Shortly afterwards, the appellant provided Grant Thornton with a folder of documents which included information relating to banking records and share transactions. 

67At the next meeting in June 2005, the appellant met with Mr Shew and Mr Stephen Thurn. More information was sought from the appellant to enable tax returns to be prepared. At this meeting, the appellant referred to tax advice he had received from Ms Harley and said that he had received a number of loans from overseas. 

68Between July and September 2005, Grant Thornton prepared file notes which, in effect, raised queries on a number of matters emerging from the folder of documents which the appellant had given to the accountants. At a meeting on 13 September 2005, Mr Thurn queried the appellant in relation to payments which had been received by Barat Advisory. Mr Thurn was told that certain substantial amounts of money were loans from Challinor Equities. 

69The next recorded meeting was in September 2006. At about this time, Colin Samuel, a Manager at Grant Thornton, took over from Mr Thurn the task of preparing tax returns for Barat Advisory and the appellant. Mr Samuel set about endeavouring to obtain information from the appellant and from the appellant's bookkeeper. In response to a request from Mr Samuel, the appellant sent an email which attached information in relation to share transactions by Barat Advisory from the period 10 October 2005 until 16 August 2006. This information made no reference to the Admerex shares. On 6 October 2006, Mr Samuel sent an email to the appellant and his bookkeeper seeking details of all share transactions by Barat Advisory for the financial year ending 30 June 2005. On 19 October 2006, Mr Samuel sent an email to the appellant which raised queries about details for the financial year ending 30 June 2005. Specifically, it recorded a query about a deposit of $1 million which had been said to relate to Clairmont. 

70The appellant sent an email to Mr Samuel on 19 October 2006 asking for a meeting to discuss the queries that had been raised by the accountant. The meeting was to take place on 31 October 2006. 

71On 25 October 2006, Mr Samuel received an email from Bell Potter Securities attaching a printout of share transactions by Barat Advisory from the period from 1 January 2004 to 25 October 2006. That printout made no reference to the Admerex shares. Prior to the proposed meeting, Mr Shew sent an email to the appellant, indicating that more information was required to support tax returns, both by Barat Advisory and the appellant. At the meeting, a timeline was given by the appellant to the accountants which confirmed his instructions that ""he funded his lifestyle with loans received from Clairmont"". 

72On the basis of all the information provided by the appellant, Grant Thornton prepared a number of draft documents, including an income tax return for Barat Advisory for the financial year ending 30 June 2005. The documents were provided under cover of a letter from Mr Shew dated 10 November 2006, which included the following statement: 

""Please read the financial statements carefully. The Director's Statement that you signed states that you believe that the accounts are a true reflection of the financial position of the company and that the company can pay its debts as and when they fall due. 

We wish to remind you that we have not audited the financial statements of the company. Ultimate responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts and tax return rests with you as Director."" 

73On or around 13 November 2006, Grant Thornton received the 2004 Barat Advisory income tax return, and the 2005 Barat Advisory income tax return, both signed by the appellant. As instructed by the appellant, the two returns were then lodged electronically with the Australian Tax Office (""ATO""). 

74In the 2004 Barat Advisory income tax return, the appellant declared that: 

(a) the total taxable income of Barat Advisory for the financial year ending 30 June 2004 was a loss of $7,375.00, and 

(b) the net capital gain derived by Barat Advisory for the financial year ending 30 June 2004 was $9.00. 

75In the 2005 Barat Advisory income tax return, the appellant declared that: 

(a) the total taxable income of Barat Advisory for the financial year ending 30 June 2005 was $17,323.00, and 

(b) the net capital gain derived by Barat Advisory for the financial year ending 30 June 2005 was $4,597.00, realised on the sale of Admerex shares which were acquired on 13 September 2004 at a cost of $14,862.00 and sold on 15 October 2004 for $19,459.00. 

76In June 2007, Grant Thornton prepared financial statements and income tax returns for Barat Advisory for the financial year ending 30 June 2006. The tax return for that year was lodged with the ATO in June 2007. It did not disclose any capital gain derived by Barat Advisory on the sale of the 55 million Admerex shares, or any portion of the Admerex shares. In January 2008, Barat Advisory income tax return for the financial year ending 30 June 2007 was lodged. It did not disclose any capital gain derived by Barat Advisory on the sale of the 55 million Admerex shares, or any portion of the Admerex shares. 

77In his remarks on sentence, the trial judge said: 

""The offender deliberately and dishonestly failed to tell Grant Thornton and Mr Shew, Mr Thurn and Mr Samuel about the disposal of the 48 million Admerex shares on or about 3 February 2005 in order to avoid the payment by Barat Advisory of tax on the net capital gain arising from that disposal. 

His Honour found that Barat Advisory ought to have paid tax in the amount of between approximately $1,964,727.00 and $2,466,399.00 on the net capital gain."" 

The course of the trial 

78In July 2010, prior to the empanelment of the jury, the appellant made a number of applications upon which the trial judge was required to adjudicate. The most significant of these was an application for a permanent stay of the trial on the basis of an abuse of process. The abuse of process was said to arise because of the juxtaposition of the money laundering charge and the dishonest obtaining charge in the one Indictment. Ultimately, in a lengthy decision given in August 2010, the trial judge declined to order a permanent stay. There was no appeal from that decision. However, the application itself, and the arguments presented in relation to it, underscored a recurring theme in the trial and the sentencing proceedings after verdict. We consider that it may be helpful to a better understanding of a number of the arguments which were relied on in this appeal if we briefly refer to the conclusion reached by the trial judge in his pre-trial judgment and the reasons for it. 

79One of the principal arguments advanced by the appellant in his pre-trial application was founded upon principles stated in the well known decision of the High Court in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. The submission made was that there was an abuse of process because the criminality of the first charge encompassed the criminality of the second. The argument was that there was no additional criminality involved in the prior dealing that was not necessarily encompassed in the s 135.1 offence. The appellant, it was claimed, was ""being twice vexed for the one cause"". The appellant sought to bring about a situation where the money laundering charge should be stayed on the basis that it was an abuse of process, with it being open to the Crown to proceed on the dishonest obtaining charge. 

80The trial judge gave detailed considerations to the authorities dealing with abuse of process in the context of the stay application. His Honour said (Appeal Book Vol 1, 69): 

""Part of the resolution of that question will involve an understanding of the ability of a court, in accordance with Pearce v The Queen, if the point is reached where sentence is to be passed on both matters, to adopt a commonsense approach to the assessment of criminality with respect to each offence, without the use of excessive subtleties and refinements, in determining whether the same acts are common to the two offences and whether there are remnants of criminality in one of the offences, which are not present in the other."" 

81The second aspect of the trial judge's analysis related to an examination of a number of cases involving the money laundering provisions contained in Division 400 of Part 10.2 of Chapter 10 of the Code. We shall, at a later stage, set out the relevant sections of these provisions. For the moment, it is sufficient to observe that the trial judge gave careful consideration to the relevant authorities. They included R v Ansari [2007] NSWCCA 204; 70 NSWLR 89; R v Foster [2008] QCA 90; (2009) 1 QdR 53; R v Wing Cheong Li [2010] NSWCCA 125; Thorne v R [2009] NSWCCA 294; Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58; 77 NSWLR 463; R v Guo ; R v Quian [2010] NSWCCA 170; R v Jones ; R v Hili [2010] NSWCCA 108; and Schembri v R [2010] NSWCCA 149. 

82The trial judge stated that these authorities represented ""strong reminders"" to prosecutors that the money laundering offences in s 400 were to be used ""in a measured way"". An assessment was required, his Honour held, in the circumstances of each particular case as to whether a money laundering charge ought to be brought, or a combination of charges including a money laundering offence and other offences. While his Honour recognised that in a number of cases the court had intervened to prevent a particular prosecution proceeding on the charges selected by the prosecutor, those cases, in his Honour's view, were significantly different from the circumstances of the trial upon which he was about to embark. His Honour said (Appeal Book Vol 1, 91 at [170]): 

""I accept the submissions of the Crown that there are significant additional features with respect to the areas of alleged criminality lying within the first and second counts. With respect to the money laundering charge, the alleged conduct of the accused with respect to the Stichting Group is an elaborate additional feature. With respect to the dishonest obtaining charge, I accept the Crown submission that there was effectively a second phase of conduct, commencing with alleged communications between the accused and his accountants which culminated in the lodging of the allegedly false return."" 

83The trial judge was not satisfied that the prosecution of both charges in the present matter constituted an abuse of process. His Honour found that the appellant had not made out a case for a permanent stay on the Indictment. For present purposes it is appropriate to observe, as we have indicated, that the particular aspects of criminality mentioned by his Honour arise in both the conviction and sentence appeals as a recurring theme. 

84Thereafter, the jury were empanelled and the trial commenced on 18 October 2010. The trial was very much facilitated by a series of sensible agreements between the parties. This included the formal admission of a number of facts pursuant to s 184 of the Evidence Act 1995. Those Agreed Facts were admitted in the Crown case as Exhibit B. Mr Peter Hastings QC appeared for the Crown and made the Crown opening. Mr Lionel Robberds QC, with Mr M Wigney SC and Mr M Polden appeared for the appellant. There was a brief defence opening. This highlighted the fact that a central issue in the trial would be whether the sale and transfer of the Admerex shares on 11 June 2004 carried with it both the beneficial and legal interest in those shares. The defence case was that Ms Harley established the five overseas companies and the five Stichting Groups, with the consequent sale of the Admerex shares to the five companies, so that, if the opportunity arose, those five companies and Stichting Groups could be part of a proposed takeover of the Swiss company, Temenos. Mr Robberds explained to the jury in his opening that, if the fact were that Barat Advisory had transferred the Admerex shares both legally and beneficially on 11 June 2004, as the defence maintained, there could be no question of it making a capital gain as a result of any transaction which may have occurred in February 2005. 

85Given the complexities of the trial, it might have been thought that it would have taken many weeks to conclude. This was not to be the case, however, and the efficient running of the trial meant that the evidence concluded within some 12 days. The principal witnesses called for the Crown were Peter Carney, Anne Harley, Kim Goodall, Sean Mark (a financial analyst with the Australian Federal Police) and a number of accountants who had been involved in the preparation of Barat Advisory's and the appellant's financial statements and tax returns. 

86Mr Carney was an accountant who had worked for a time for Admerex Limited. Ms Harley was the solicitor from Atanaskovic Hartnell who had provided advice to the appellant in the period 2003 to 2006. Mr Goodall was, as we have indicated earlier, at one time a Vice-Chairman of Temenos. He was a founder of the company, a shareholder and had associations with it at the time he gave his evidence. Mr Mark had prepared a flowchart which demonstrated in graphic but helpful form the sequence of events relied upon by the Crown in the proof of its case. The flow chart became Exhibit A in the trial. 

87At the conclusion of the Crown case, an application was made by the appellant for verdicts by direction. The principal basis on which a verdict by direction was sought on the first count related to the beneficial ownership issue. The defence maintained that, on the face of the documents effecting the share transfers on 11 June 2004, there could be no suggestion other than that the legal and beneficial ownership thereby passed to the transferee companies. Since it was no part of the Crown case that these transactions were a sham, it was argued, the beneficial interest in the Admerex shares must have been transferred to the five Stichting Group companies in June 2004. This resulted in a situation that the February 2005 transaction could not have been a Capital Gains event. This submission embraced the further proposition that the Crown case accepted that no person, other than the appellant, intended to deceive third parties in relation to the transfer and ownership of the Admerex shares, or acted in any way dishonestly or fraudulently in relation to the transfers. Accordingly, it was submitted that there was no evidence to support the charge contained in the first count. The critical point made was that, if there were no evidence that Barat Advisory had any beneficial interest in the shares after 11 June 2004, this was, as a matter of law, fatal to the Crown case on the first count. 

88The trial judge rejected this submission. He held, first, that there were documents signed by the appellant in which he had certified that he was the beneficial owner of funds used to establish the Stichtings. There was the ""beneficial owner"" document signed by Mr Meisterhans. In addition, there was evidence demonstrating an element of control by the appellant with respect to both the shares and the conduct of Mr Meisterhans. This pointed to the latter acting as the agent of the appellant with respect to the shares. There was evidence to support the Crown proposition that after June 2004, the appellant was acting, as it was put by the Crown, ""on both sides of the table"". 

89Mr Robberds QC, however, had presented additional arguments in connection with his submission that there should be a verdict by direction on the first count. These were, firstly, that for the offence to be made out, the shares the subject of the first count had to be ""capable"" of becoming an instrument of crime, that is, capable of facilitating the commission of the offence contrary to s 134.2 of the Code. Mr Robberds submitted that a person can only deal with property within the meaning of s 400.3(1) if the property could, in the future, become an instrument of crime. The argument advanced was that, after the disposal of the shares on 3 February 2005, it was simply impossible for the shares to be used by the accused to facilitate the commission by Barat Advisory of the s 134.2 offence because the appellant no longer controlled them. 

90Secondly, Mr Robberds maintained that, on the Crown case, the appellant had always intended that Barat Advisory would avoid the payment of Capital Gains Tax. This meant, on the Crown case, that Barat Advisory, come what may, would never disclose in its income tax returns of either the sale of the shares or any capital gain which it might make at some point after 11 June 2004, however that might occur. Accordingly, the intended commission by Barat Advisory of the s 134.2 offence did not require the use of the 48 million shares and thus, on 3 February, they could not in any way ""facilitate"" Barat Advisory in relation to its decision to lodge the 2005 income tax return without disclosing the sale or any consequent capital gain. 

91Thirdly, it was argued that the shares themselves had no properties that made them capable of facilitating the commission of any offence by Barat Advisory relating to the lodgement of tax returns - they were simply shares and nothing more. 

92Finally, in relation to the first count, it was submitted that there was no evidence adduced by the Crown that the appellant ever intended that the 48 million shares would become an instrument of crime, in that they would be used to facilitate the alleged breach of s 134.2 by Barat Advisory. 

93The Crown, in response, argued that there was evidence that a number of preparatory steps had been taken by the appellant after the purported assignment of the shares on 11 June 2004. Subsequently, and specifically on 3 February 2005, the shares were used as an instrument of crime, and had an ongoing function in that regard. This was because a consequence of the share exchange was that the Temenos shares came into the possession of the appellant and enabled him to gain access to the proceeds of the allotment of the Admerex shares by selling off the Temenos shares. In this way, the Crown argued, there was an ongoing use, as a result of the transaction, throughout the period leading up to the end of the financial year. The Crown argued that, while it was its case that the appellant always had in mind that Barat Advisory would avoid the payment of Capital Gains Tax, it was not until the share swap on 3 February 2005 that the conduct became an offence against s 400.3(1). It was this dealing with property that triggered the offence. The Crown submitted that, by swapping the Admerex shares with the Temenos shares, with their increased ability to be sold discreetly, the appellant facilitated the commission of the offence. 

94The trial judge rejected the defence submissions. His Honour found that there was evidence capable of supporting the proposition that Barat Advisory, despite the documentation, had retained the beneficial ownership in the Admenex shares. Secondly, his Honour accepted the Crown submissions with respect to the use of the Admenex shares and the way in which it was said that this was capable of facilitating the commission by Barat of a s 134.2 offence. 

95In relation to the second count, apart from the beneficial ownership issue, the defence relied on an additional argument that there was, in any event, no ""disposal"" of the 48 million Admerex shares on 3 February 2005. It was submitted that the evidence demonstrated that the shares were not disposed of until the occurrence of the transfer by Mr Goodall to First European Finance Investments Ltd in September 2005. The effect of this, it was argued, was that there was no capital gain from the disposal of the Admerex shares in the tax year ending 30 June 2005, so that the charge contained in the second count was, for that reason, fatally flawed. 

96The trial judge was satisfied that there was evidence that the disposal of the Admerex shares by means of the share swap on or about 3 February 2005 constituted a contract or a disposal of the property so as to be capable of constituting a capital gains event occurring in the financial year ending 30 June 2005. He refused to direct a verdict on the second count. 

97Following the unsuccessful application for a verdict by direction on the two counts in the Indictment, the Crown made its closing submissions to the jury. The appellant did not give evidence. The defence commenced its closing address on 9 November 2010 and concluded on the following day. However, there was a late flurry of argument before the trial judge (in the absence of the jury) concerning the form of final directions that should be given by the trial judge in his summing up. His Honour delivered a brief judgment during the course of his summing up which dealt with these outstanding issues. We shall briefly mention the nature of this late contest. 

98First, counsel for the appellant took issue with a term used by the Crown in his closing submissions. This was the expression ""blind trust"" a reference to the transfer to the Stichting companies. His Honour accepted the defence submission on this point and indicated that he would direct the jury to put the term ""blind trust"" to one side and to have regard to the submissions which had been made to them, both orally and in written form by reference to the term ""trust"". 

99Secondly, the defence expressed concern that, although the Crown had not argued that the arrangements for the transfer of the Admerex shares to the five overseas companies on 11 June 2004 had been a sham, the Crown had advanced its case before the jury in submissions that, in effect, suggested that the arrangements constituted a sham. Consequently, the defence argued that specific directions in that regard were required. 

100The trial judge considered that the word ""sham"" had not been used by the Crown in the presence of the jury. Further, he indicated that he did not propose to inject the term into the trial during his summing up. His Honour, however, accepted the need to give some further directions and he said: 

""The focus of those directions, however, should be upon the need for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt what he contends happened here, namely that the accused was the controlling mind on or after 11 June 2004 of Barat Advisory and was also the controlling mind of the five overseas companies and, in this regard, that it was the intention of the accused, as the controlling mind of each of the five overseas companies, that only the legal title, and not the beneficial title, to the 55 million shares in Admerex was to be transferred to the five overseas companies, and that those companies would hold the shares on trust for Barat Advisory."" 

101His Honour concluded, contrary to the defence submissions, that it would not be necessary for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Directors of the five overseas companies had acquiesced in their duties in favour of the appellant, and that this had amounted to an abdication by the Directors of their duties and responsibilities as Directors. He declined to give a direction to suggest that the Crown carried the burden of proving each of these matters beyond reasonable doubt. 

102In the course of his summing up, which extended over a number of days, the trial judge provided the jury with written directions on tax law, and written directions in relation to the elements of each of the two offences charged in the Indictment. A further series of directions was given at the conclusion of his Honour's summing-up relating to the ""controlling mind issue"" on the contract/tax law issue. The jury retired to consider its verdict on the afternoon of 17 November 2010. On 19 November 2010, shortly prior to midday, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty to both charges. The jury were thereafter discharged and arrangements were made for sentencing submissions to be taken on 2 December 2010. On that day, his Honour formally entered convictions against the appellant in relation to each of the offences upon which the jury had found him guilty. Proceedings were further adjourned for the pronouncement of sentence on 17 December 2010. Bail was continued until that day. On 17 December 2010, the trial judge imposed the sentences which we have set out at the commencement of this decision. The appellant was then taken into custody. 

Principal issues at trial 

103It can be seen that, notwithstanding the complexity of the factual circumstances surrounding the establishment of the Stichting group structure and the acquisition and disposition of the Admerex and Temenos shares, the principal issues at trial were, in a number of respects, straightforward. The Crown case was that, on or about 3 February 2005, the appellant, on behalf of Barat Advisory Pty Ltd, dealt with property by disposing of 48 million shares in Admerex. It did so by exchanging them for 1 million shares in Temenos. It was the Crown case that the 48 million Admerex shares could be used to facilitate the commission of a Commonwealth Indictable offence. This would be the case if there were an intentional failure to disclose the capital gain which had been derived in connection with the disposal of those shares and the consequent failure by Barat Advisory to pay tax on that capital gain. The trial judge gave written directions to the jury indicating that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to each of those matters. 

104Further, the Crown case was that although Barat Advisory had transferred the Admerex shares to the five overseas companies on 11 June 2004, in doing so, it had, as subsequent activities demonstrated, retained beneficial ownership of those shares. It was accepted that, if Barat Advisory had disposed of both the legal title and beneficial ownership of the shares in June 2004, it could not again dispose of them on 3 February 2005. 

105In this regard, the trial judge directed the jury: 

If you are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Barat Advisory only transferred the legal and not the beneficial title of the shares to the five companies on 11 June 2004, you must acquit the accused. 

106The Crown accepted at trial that it was necessary to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intended that the property, namely the 48 million Admerex shares, would become an instrument of crime. That is, on or about 3 February 2005, the appellant intended that the 48 million Admerex shares would be used to facilitate (make easier) the commission of an offence. 

107In the written directions (paragraph 22), the trial judge stated: 

The Crown alleges that the accused intended that the 48 million shares would be used to facilitate the commission of an offence which involved the accused, at some time in the future, dishonestly obtaining a financial gain by causing Barat Advisory to lodge an income tax return that contained false information because it did not include information about the capital gain that Barat Advisory is alleged to have made when it swapped the 48 million Admerex shares for the 1 million Temenos shares on 3 February 2005... 

108As to this, the written directions (paragraph 23) stated: 

The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that, on or around 3 February 2005, the accused intended that the 48 million shares would facilitate (that is, make easier) that type of offence to be committed. 

109In relation to count 2, the principal issues may be stated as follows: 

First, whether on 3 February 2005, Barat Advisory had the beneficial ownership of the 48 million shares in Admerex so as to have the capacity to dispose of them on that date, thereby creating a capital gains event. Once again, the defence case was that the legal and beneficial ownership of the shares had been transferred by Barat Advisory on 11 June 2004 to the five overseas companies. If Barat Advisory had disposed of the Admerex shares on the earlier date, it could not again dispose of them on 3 February 2005. 

Secondly, the Crown case was that the 48 million Admerex shares were disposed of on 3 February 2005, because either the appellant, on behalf of Barat Advisory, entered into a contract with Mr Goodall to transfer the shares to him on that day; or because there was a change of ownership of the Admerex shares on that day in that the Temenos shares were accepted by Barat Advisory as consideration for the Admerex shares. The defence argument was that there was no disposal on 3 February 2005 and that the earliest time when the shares were disposed of was 14 September 2005. If this were the case, as the defence urged, there would have been, whoever was the transferor, no liability for Capital Gains Tax in the financial year ending 30 June 2005. 

Written directions were given by the trial judge to reflect these issues in relation to count 2. 

110There were, of course, other elements of each offence beyond those we have identified. For the purposes of this appeal, however, the principal issues at trial were those we have mentioned. 

Grounds for appeal against conviction 

111The amended statement of the grounds of appeal against conviction contains seven grounds. We shall deal with each of these separately. 

Ground 1 

112Ground 1 asserts that the trial judge erred in refusing to direct the jury to acquit the appellant on each count in the Indictment. There are some seven particulars given under ground one wherein it is alleged that the trial judge erred in the decision given on 4 November 2010 refusing directed verdicts. Five of these particulars relate to count 1. The remaining two relate to the second count in the Indictment. We shall deal with each separately or collectively, depending whether the particulars are separate or linked. 

113Particular (a): 

""His Honour erred in taking into account that in the first count in the Indictment, the offence was said to have been committed between about 30 April 2004 and about 30 September 2005 when the Crown case was that the offence was committed on or about 3 February 2005 at which time the Crown alleged the share swap occurred."" 

114In the decision given on 4 November 2010, the trial judge had held (paragraph 33) that the evidence in the Crown case, taken as a whole, was capable of supporting each of the elements of the s 400.3(1) offence in the circumstances of the case. In that context his Honour added (paragraph 35): 

""I bear in mind that the offence charged in the first count is said to have been committed between about 30 April 2004 and about 30 September 2005. There are, of course, a number of key points in time within that period, and in particular the share swap on or about 3 February 2005."" 

His Honour added (paragraph 37): 

""I am satisfied that there is some evidence in support of each element of the section 400.3(1) offence so that the first count in the Indictment should be left to the jury."" 

115We do not consider that any error has been demonstrated in paragraph 35 of the trial judge's decision. Read fairly, the comment recognises that the date of ultimate significance was the 3 February 2005, but that nevertheless it was appropriate to take into account the broader context in which the disposal took place. On the basis of the Crown case, what gave the disposal of the shares an unlawful character was both the motive behind the disposal and the structure which the appellant had put in place in which the transfer was able to be put into effect. In that regard, it could not be ignored that, according to the Crown case, the appellant, in his capacity as the controlling mind of Barat Advisory and of each of the Stichting Group companies, intended, notwithstanding Ms Harley's statements to him, that the beneficial interest in the Admerex shares would remain with Barat Advisory. Moreover, this broader context was central to both the prosecution and the defence cases. What his Honour was saying was that the Crown circumstantial case had to be examined in its broader context and, in that context, there was evidence capable of supporting the charge being left to the jury. That broader context included, of course, the precipitous events of 2 and 3 February 2005. The defence case too, based as it was on Ms Harley's advice and her subsequent actions in the middle of 2004, placed emphasis on the same broad context, although it sought to characterise those matters in a very different way to the position advocated by the Crown. 

Particulars (b)-(e) 

116These particulars embrace a number of the matters that had been put to the trial judge at the time of the directed verdict application. However, they were reformulated for the purposes of this appeal. In their modified format, these particulars require, if accepted, that this Court enter a verdict of acquittal on the first count. 

117The arguments advanced may be distilled into the following propositions. First, once the Admerex shares were disposed of by the share swap, thereafter the appellant had no ability to use them in any way at all. Accordingly, the disposal of the shares ruled out any intended use of the shares by the appellant to facilitate the future commission of an offence. In other words, once the shares were gone, they were gone for all purposes, and could not be used in any way at all. 

118Secondly, and more importantly, Mr Robberds argued that there was nothing that the shares themselves could do to facilitate the Barat Advisory offence. They were simply shares. The consequence was that, as a matter of law, the 48 million Admerex shares could not in the present matter become an instrument of crime: they were incapable of facilitating by deception the financial advantage involved in the s 134.2 offence. They might, it was conceded, facilitate some other offence. But not this one. 

119In support of this argument, Mr Robberds submitted that there were three steps necessary for Barat Advisory to take in order to commit the offence under s 134.2. These were: 

(a) Barat Advisory had to lodge its 2005 tax return; 

(b) The return had to deliberately omit the capital gain; 

(c) The ATO had to issue an assessment accepting the basis of the return. 

120Mr Robberds argued that none of these three steps involved the use of the shares. Indeed, he maintained that the shares could not have been used in relation to any of those necessary steps. The lodgement of the return facilitated the offence but the shares did not. In a broader sense, the ""share swap"" facilitated the offence but the shares themselves did not and could not do so. 

121Thirdly, Mr Robberds took issue with the Crown categorisation of the ""use"" of the shares as one that was, in any event, fundamentally flawed. The Crown had argued that the circumstances of the swap (the disposal itself) facilitated the commission of the offence. This was because, as the Crown submitted, the transaction was off market and because it occurred behind the screen of the Stichting Groups (Crown Submissions, paragraph 10). 

122In relation to this proposition, Mr Robberds submitted, first, that ""the intended use has to be a use of the property after it had been disposed of"" and secondly, that the circumstances in which the swap was carried out ""could not be said to be a use of the shares."" Senior Counsel argued that it was neither a relevant use of the shares, nor importantly was it a use of the shares after the swap had taken place. 

123Mr Robberds put his propositions into two fundamental questions: 

First, what were the possible ways the 48 million Admerex shares could be used to facilitate the s 134.2 offence by Barat Advisory? 

Second, in what way did the appellant intend as at 3 February 2005 that the shares would be used to facilitate the s 134.2 offence? 

Mr Robberds submitted that the answer to each of these question must be in the negative. 

124As a consequence, Mr Robberds submitted that it was simply impossible to accommodate the facts of the case to the charge in count 1. As a matter of law, he argued, the Crown case placed reliance on facts that could not possibly constitute a use within the meaning of the expression 'instrument of crime'. It followed that there was no evidence that, when the appellant dealt with the 48 million Admerex shares by swapping them for 1 million Temenos shares on 3 February 2005, he intended that those Admerex shares themselves would become an instrument of crime. He could not have had that intention because the shares were incapable of such a use. 

125We shall now set out the terms of s 400.3 of the Code: 

"" 400.3 Dealing in proceeds of crime etc. - money or property worth $1,000,000 or more 

(1) A person is guilty of an offence if:

126Section 400.2 is, relevantly, in the following terms: 

"" 400.2 Meaning of dealing with money or other property 

(1) For the purposes of this Division, a person deals with money or other property if: 

(a) the person does any of the following: 

(i) receives, possesses, conceals or disposes of money or other property; 

... and 

(b) the money or other property is proceeds of crime, or could become an instrument of crime, in relation to an offence that is a Commonwealth indictable offence or a foreign indictable offence ..."" 

127Section 400.1 provides the following definitions: 

""instrument of crime"" : money or other property is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or a foreign country that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence). 

""proceeds of crime"" means any money or other property that is wholly or partly derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or a foreign country that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence). 

""property"" means real or personal property of every description, whether situated in Australia or elsewhere and whether tangible or intangible, and includes an interest in any such real or personal property. 
... 
... To avoid doubt, a reference in this Division to money or other property includes a reference to financial instruments, cards and other objects that represent money or can be exchanged for money, whether or not they have intrinsic value. 

128Section 400.13 provides: 

"" 400.13 Proof of other offences is not required 
... 
(2) To avoid doubt, it is not necessary, in order to prove for the purposes of this Division an intention or risk that money or property will be an instrument of crime, to establish that: 

(a) an intention or risk that a particular offence will be committed in relation to the money or property; or 

(b) an intention or risk that a particular person will commit an offence in relation to the money or property."" 

129The money laundering provisions contained in Division 400 of Part 10.2 of Chapter 10 of the Code commenced on 1 January 2003 on the repeal of, inter alia, the money laundering offence provisions contained in s 81 and s 82 of the Proceeds of Crimes Act 1987 (Cth): Re Sunshine Worldwide Holdings Pty Limited [2005] NSWSC 117; 62 NSWLR 400 at 404 ([9]). 

130Although the general nature of money laundering offences under s 400 of the Code has been discussed in a number of decisions, it does not appear that the arguments advanced by Mr Robberds QC have been the subject of any judicial pronouncement. Counsel were unable to refer us to any decision where the particular arguments were raised or decided. 

131Some general observations, however, may be made. First, as Simpson J observed in R v Ansari at 93 ([11]), s 400.3, properly analysed, creates six different offences, in pairs, graded in descending order of seriousness. In general terms, the level of seriousness depends upon the state of mind of the accused. Common to all offences is dealing with money or other property which is either the proceeds of crime, or which it is intended will (s 400.3(1)) or might (s 400.3(2) and (3)) become an instrument of crime. Simpson J also observed in Ansari at 94 ([15]) that the ""instrument of crime"" form of a s 400 money laundering offence is an offence where an indictable offence is envisaged or contemplated in the future. It is not one where an indictable offence has already been committed, yielding the money or property as proceeds. It clearly involves the criminalisation of activities that transcend and go well beyond traditional concepts of ""money-laundering"". 

132In Ansari , Howie J made a number of observations concerning the money laundering provisions in Division 400 of Part 10.2 of the Code. We shall simply refer to a portion of those observations appearing at [118]-[122]: 

""[118] Division 400 of Pt 10.2 of the Code is entitled ""Money laundering"". For the purposes of the Division the term ""instrument of crime"" is defined in this way; ""money or other property is an instrument of crime if it is used in the commission of, or used to facilitate the commission of, an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence)"". There is also a definition of ""proceeds of crime"" being ""any money or other property that is derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of an offence that may be dealt with as an indictable offence (even if it may, in some circumstances, be dealt with as a summary offence)"". There is a wide meaning given to the term ""dealing with money or other property"" in s 400.2. It includes receiving or disposing of the money, importing it into or exporting it out of Australia and engaging ""in a banking transaction relating to money or other property"". 

[119] The offences within the Division, therefore, apply to a large range of activity in relation to money or other property to be used in connection with, or arising from, serious crime. Not only is there a very wide ambit in relation to the conduct caught by the offences but there is also a substantial range of criminal activity to which the money or property could relate, being limited in effect to an indictable offence of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory. The offences are not concerned only with the source of the money or property that is dealt with but also its ultimate use. The offences cover money obtained illegally or to be used for illegal purposes or dealt with in a manner that is illegal. 

[120] With offences that are so wide ranging in their scope it becomes somewhat difficult to imagine an offence falling within the worst category of its kind against which any particular offence can be measured. It might be thought that dealing with money that is to be used for the purposes of terrorism might be within the class of the most serious offences encompassed by the sections in the Division. But it is perhaps not so difficult to conceive of offences that will form the bulk of conduct falling within the scope of the Division that would come before the criminal courts. The most obvious will relate to money obtained as a result of drug activity and that is being dealt with in order to make it more difficult to track or identify as the proceeds of a particular crime. It may also be money that has been legitimately earned but is to be dealt with in such a way as to disguise its source in order, for example, to defraud the taxation office. 

[121] But frequently it will be impossible for the authorities to identify the origins of the funds or what is ultimately to be the use made of them, yet it can be shown that the manner of dealing with them was a breach of the law, such as to avoid the mandatory reporting conditions under the Financial Transactions Reporting Act. It may be the case that the persons dealing with the money do not know its source or ultimate destination and do not care provided they are being paid for rendering a service. 

[122] The legislation itself has attempted to structure offences to give some guidance as to the seriousness of the conduct by reference to the applicable maximum penalty for each offence. The scheme is that the greater the sum of money involved, the more serious the offence. But the legislation also takes into account the mental state of the offender, so that an offence involving the intentional dealing with proceeds of crime or instruments of crime is more serious than one where the state of mind is recklessness as to the criminal nature of the property. Therefore s 400.3(1), where the amount involved is more than a million dollars and where the offender believes that the property is the proceeds of crime or intends that it will become an instrument of crime, provides for the most serious of the money laundering offences carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and/or 1500 penalty units."" 
(Emphasis added) 

133The High Court of Australia dismissed an appeal from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal with no criticism or qualification being made concerning the observations of Howie J set out above: Ansari v R [2010] HCA 18; 266 ALR 446. 

134As a general statement, we would, with respect, adopt the observations of Johnson J in his pre-trial decision of 19 August 2010 at [161]-[164]: 

""[161] When provisions such as the money laundering offences contained in section 400 Criminal Code Act 1995 are enacted, it is clear that care must be exercised by a prosecutor in their use. As the authorities to which I have referred make clear, the money laundering provisions are broad with a capacity to extend to a wide range of circumstances. By their nature, they are likely to be intertwined with other criminal conduct. 

[162] By the enactment of these provisions, the Commonwealth has determined that criminal offences of this type are necessary to deal with the wide range of conduct which has manifested itself in contemporary society, with consequences adverse to the public interest including the revenue. 

[163] ... 

[164] At a Commonwealth level, the money laundering offences in section 400 constitute a 21 st century response to antisocial and criminal conduct commonly with international elements."" 

135We would simply re-iterate that it is clear from the terms of the legislation that conventional notions of money laundering have been extended to include circumstances where untainted money or property is dealt with in circumstances where it presently has the capacity to become an instrument of crime, and is intended by the person dealing with the property to become an instrument of crime in the future. That is to say the money or property is intended to be used to facilitate the commission of a relevant criminal offence. This novel extension to the traditional concept of money-laundering, we consider, should be given a broad and purposive interpretation. 

136We return now to the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant. We have given careful consideration to each of the arguments advanced by Mr Robberds QC in relation to particulars (b) to (e), but we have come to the conclusion that there is no substance in any of them. The issues posed by the legislation are simple and without qualification. First, did the appellant deal with money or other property? The answer to that question required, in the present matter, an examination as to whether the Admerex shares had been disposed of as alleged by the Crown, and whether the shares could be used to facilitate the commission of a (relevant) offence. 

137If the answer to each of those questions was yes, it then became necessary to ask a further question, namely whether the appellant intended, at the time of the dealing with the property, that the shares would become an instrument of crime, that is that they would be used to facilitate the obtaining by Barat Advisory of a financial advantage by deception (s 134.2 of the Code). 

138We accept, for present purposes, the preliminary proposition advanced by Mr Robberds that, as a matter of construction, the offence will only be committed where the person intends that, after the disposal of the property (or other dealing with it), the property will be used to facilitate the commission of an offence, that is at some point in the future the property will be used in that manner. 

139We are unable to accept, however, the first principal contention that the shares, once disposed of, cannot be used in any way at all. Such a construction of s 400.3(1) would significantly erode the section of its utility. The definition of ""deals with money or other property"" has been cast in very wide terms to embrace concepts of possession, receipt, concealment and disposal. It is clear that a wide and purposive construction should be preferred to one that effectively robs the legislation of its intended utility. Indeed, in one of the examples advanced by Mr Robberds, this contention was seen to be without substance. If a person sold his home, intending that the proceeds of sale would be used to fund the making of explosives to be used in a terrorist attack, the home itself, although disposed of, plainly could be said to have the capacity to facilitate the commission of the terrorism offence. Equally, the person dealing with the property could be said to intend that it would be used to facilitate the commission of the terrorism offence. 

140More significantly, in the present matter, the Admerex shares did not cease to exist upon their disposal. They remained wholly in existence but were now hidden behind the additional curtain of the Temenos shares. They remained capable of use for the future commission of an offence. Whether the property that is disposed of (or for that matter acquired, possessed or concealed) has the capacity to be used for such a purpose will depend upon the nature of the property, the circumstances, and the nature of the offence that is contemplated. We do not consider that this first argument can succeed. In fairness to Mr Robberds, he proffered it as ""a minor argument"". 

141We turn to the second and principal argument advanced by Mr Robberds. Senior counsel listed three steps that Barat Advisory would need to take in order to commit an offence under s 134.2. However, we consider that counsel's analysis omitted a first and fundamental step that would be necessary. This first step required that Barat Advisory, through the appellant, had to have made a capital gain. This in turn would have required: 

(a) that the shares were in existence; 

(b) that the appellant on behalf of Barat Advisory, had the capacity to effect a dealing in the shares; 

(c) the shares themselves had to have a value in excess of their cost base; and 

(d) the gain in value had to be characterised as a consequence of the nature of the disposal. 

142The plain fact is that none of those matters, referable to this first necessary step, could have occurred otherwise than by reference to the shares themselves. In that sense, the shares were critical to the future commission of an offence, and to the intention of the appellant in that regard. Without the shares, a future offence of obtaining an advantage by deception could not occur. In other words, the offence could not have been committed without the shares. 

143In that important sense, the shares had the capacity to, and did, facilitate the commission of the relevant offence, if the crown case were accepted. At the preliminary stage where a verdict by direction had been sought, there was, so far as these particular arguments were concerned, ample evidence to show that, the Crown case, if accepted, would entitle the jury to convict in relation to the first count. 

144It may be true, as Mr Robberds argued, that there were other facilitators in relation to the commission of the relevant offence but there can be no doubt, in our view, that the shares themselves were capable of being viewed as a facilitator and indeed a fundamental one. 

145There has been no judicial consideration of the meaning of ""facilitate"" for the purposes of s 400.3(1) of the Code. We have already referred to the way in which the trial judge directed the jury on this issue, namely, by ascribing to the word ""facilitate"" its ordinary English meaning of ""make easier"". It is relevant to observe that, in a different statutory context, it has been held that where property is instrumental in the commission of an offence, as opposed to incidental in its commission, the property may be said to have facilitated the commission of the offence: see Draper v Police [2009] SASC 264 and the cases discussed therein. This construction lends support to the Crown's argument, in that the shares were the means by which the appellant was able to acquire a capital gain, which was subsequently omitted from Barat Advisory's 2005 tax return. In that sense, the shares were instrumental in the commission of the s 134.2 offence. 

146There is no warrant to give the definition of ""instrument of crime"" a narrow meaning. Nor is there any warrant to give a narrow meaning to the expression ""to facilitate the commission of an offence"". The entirety of the sentence: 

""Money or other property is an instrument of crime if it is ... used to facilitate the commission of an offence, etc"" 

ought to be given a wide interpretation. The shares were plainly capable of being used, and, on the Crown case, were intended to be used after their ""disposal"" to facilitate the commission of a s 134.2 offence. The two questions posed by Mr Robberds must be answered in the affirmative. 

147Mr Robberds' third argument, with respect, does not survive careful analysis. Counsel's complaint related to the way in which the Crown had expressed its final submissions to the jury. He argued, no doubt correctly, that the intended use had to be a ""use after the shares had been disposed of"". Consequently, the circumstances of the swap could not facilitate the commission of the offence. The share swap, Mr Robberds said, could not be an instrument of crime because it was a transaction. It was not property. 

148In simple terms, the offence under s 400.3 of the Code is one of dealing with property (property that could be used to facilitate an offence) and in doing so intending that the property will be used to facilitate the commission of that offence. Thus, the intention of the person dealing with the property is critical in proving the commission of an offence under s 400.3. In a criminal trial, intention is commonly demonstrated by the actions of the person in relation to the central activity (for example, in an assault case, striking another person). But a person's state of mind may also be illuminated by his or her actions both before and after the striking. 

149The submissions of the Crown at trial correctly recognised that the circumstances and nature of the dealing with the shares in the present matter - the disposal by way of an off market swap - had the capacity to demonstrate the existence of the relevant criminal intention. Further evidence in proof of this intention could be derived from the misuse of the Stichting structures, the possible reasons for their establishment and the appellant's activities at the time of and following the share swap. 

150The disposal of the Admerex shares in the present matter had two features that were relevant to proof of the appellant's intention that the shares would be used to facilitate the commission of the s 134.2 offence. First, the share swap created the CGT event which provided the basis for the commission of the future crime. Secondly, it provided a facilitating mechanism for the commission of the offence in that it provided a further cloak or curtain behind which the act of ultimate deception (the lodgement of a return) would be more likely to succeed. It had the capacity to assist the very advantage the deception (by lodgement of the tax returns) was intended to secure. As we have explained, however, the Admerex shares were a critical facilitating factor in that intended criminal pursuit. The manner of their disposal provided evidence, along with other matters of the appellant's criminal intention and also provided a further facilitating measure for the offence itself. In those respects, the appellant intended that the shares would be used to facilitate the s 134.2 offence. 

151Accordingly, we conclude that the trial judge was not in error in refusing to direct the jury to acquit the appellant on the first count in the indictment. Nor do we consider that the construction arguments, as reformulated for the purpose of this appeal, have merit. Particulars (b) - (e) to ground 1 have not been established. 

Particulars (f) and (g) 

152These relate to the trial judge's refusal to direct a verdict on count 2. Once again, if accepted, they require that this Count enter a verdict of acquittal. The two particulars refer to submissions made to the trial judge relating to the Crown assertion that on or about February 2005 there had been a disposal of the 48 million Admerex shares so as to be capable of constituting a capital gains event occurring in the financial year ending 30 June 2005. There were two aspects of the submission. The first queried whether there was any evidence to show that there had been an actual disposal of the Admerex shares in February 2005. Secondly, there was a submission that, even if there were evidence that a disposal of the Admerex shares had taken place, the evidence showed that it did not happen in the financial year ending June 2005, but in the following year. 

153At paragraph 40 of the trial judge's decision 4 November 2010, his Honour said: 

""In addition, Mr Robberds QC submitted that there was no evidence that the disposal of the 48 million Admerex shares took place on the 3 rd of February 2005. It was submitted that the evidence demonstrated that the shares were not disposed of until a transfer to First European Finance Investments Limited in September 2005. The effect of this, it was submitted, was that there was no capital gain from the disposal of the 48 million Admerex shares in the tax year ended 30 June 2005 so that the charge contained in the second count was fatally flawed."" 

154His Honour was satisfied that there was evidence that the disposal of the Admerex shares by means of the share swap on or about 3 February 2005 constituted the disposal of property so as to be capable of constituting a capital gains event occurring in the financial year ending 30 June 2005. 

155The Crown maintained before the trial judge (and maintains in this Court) that there was evidence to warrant count 2 being left before the jury. The Crown pointed to the February conversation between the appellant and Goodall - the immediate transfer of one million Temenos shares to Challinor Equities (one of the appellant's Stichting Group Companies) and the appellant's directions to Meisterhans for the immediate disposal of the shares as and from that date. On the other side of the transaction, there was evidence that Goodall appeared to accept, albeit passively, the appellant's ""direction"" that he was to take one million of the Temenos shares in exchange for 49 million Admerex shares. There was no resistance on his part to the transfer of the Temenos shares for the use of the appellant. Moreover, the Crown pointed to the evidence that later in the year Goodall, in apparent acknowledgment of the deal, arranged for the Admerex shares to be transferred to a third party nominated by him. 

156We consider that the trial judge was correct to conclude that there was evidence before the jury sufficient to enable count 2 to be left to the jury for its decision. The evidence, taken at its highest, was capable of sustaining a verdict of guilty: Doney v R (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 215; R v R (1989) 44 A Crim R 404. In our opinion, there was a sufficiency of evidence, if accepted, to enable the jury to conclude that what had taken place between the two men constituted a disposal of a CGT asset because of the change in legal ownership of the Admerex shares on 3 February 2005 (ss 104-110 of the Income Tax Assessment Act ). At the very least, there was evidence to show part performance of such a transaction in that the appellant had taken the Temenos shares for himself and made the Admerex shares available to Goodall. 

Grounds 2 and 3 

157Each of these grounds arises out of the decision by the trial judge on 15 November 2010 (Milne (No 4)). This decision was given, following brief argument, during the course of his Honour's summing up to the jury. 

158During the Crown address, the defence, in the absence of the jury, raised issues about certain propositions advanced by the Crown before the jury. This led to submissions being made to the judge as to whether he should give directions on these matters, and if so, what form the directions should take. 

159Grounds 2 and 3 relate to two of those matters. Ground 2 asserts that the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that they could not find as a fact that the appellant was ""the controlling mind"" of the five companies unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the directors of those companies had abdicated their duties and responsibilities as directors. Ground 3 asserts that his Honour erred in failing to direct the jury that they could not convict the appellant on either count unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the transfers of the shares from Barat to the five companies on 11 June 2004 had the attributes of a sham arrangement. 

160At paragraph 12 (Milne No 4), the trial judge declined to give the ""abdication direction"". At paragraphs 8, and 10, in relation to the ""sham"" contention, his Honour said: 

""8. The defence submission was that, although the Crown had maintained that it was not contending that the arrangements for the transfer of the Admerex shares from Barat to the five overseas companies on 11 June 2004 was a sham, the way in which the Crown advanced its case before the jury in submissions was, in reality, a submission that the arrangements constituted a sham. It was submitted that a consequence of this was that the attributes of a sham agreement (as referred to in civil cases) became necessary factual matters which the Crown must establish in this case. Reliance was placed upon passages in the decision of the High Court of Australia in Equus Corp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55; 218 CLR 471 and Raftland Pty Ltd v Commission of Taxation [2008] HCA 21; 238 CLR 516 ... 10. It is the case that the word ""sham"" is not being used in the presence of the jury and I do not propose to inject the term into the trial during the summing up. The real issue for determination concerns a direction which ought to be given to the jury by reference to what the Crown intends happen in this case."" 

161Mr Robberds took this Court in considerable detail to the documents bearing on the June 2004 transfer of the Admerex shares to the Stichting Group companies. Particular focus was placed upon the documentation which Mr Meisterhans had signed. In particular, the Deeds of Charge signed by Mr Meisterhans would have brought home to him, counsel suggested, the structure of the five companies and the structure of the five Stichtings. In particular, it would have brought home the fact that the five companies of which the Stichtings were the sole shareholders were intended to acquire the legal and beneficial interests in the Admerex shares, over which they were to provide charges to secure the financial obligations of the Stichtings pursuant to the Master Investment Futures Agreement. 

162Accordingly, if Mr Meisterhans knew, by agreement with the appellant or otherwise, that the appellant was to retain the beneficial ownership, he would also realise that the whole object of the Stichting structure would be frustrated. He would realise, Mr Robberds argued, that the warranties as to ownership in the Deeds were false. Consequently, the Crown case required a direction to the jury of the kind sought. 

163We agree with the Crown submission, however, that no such direction was necessary. Any question concerning Mr Meisterhans ""abdicating"" his duties and responsibilities as a director was immaterial to the elements of the offence in count 1 and would have constituted an unnecessary distraction in the trial. 

164It is true that Mr Meisterhans was a director of each of the foreign companies and was responsible for establishing the accounts at the three banks which held the Admerex and then the Temenos shares. However, Mr Meisterhans had no beneficial interest or equity in the assets held by the foreign companies, nor in the shares in the bank accounts of EFG and SwissFirst. 

165Mr Meisterhans was a partner in the Swiss Financial Services Company Sinitus. The evidence showed that he, through Sinitus, had at an earlier time provided an agency type service in relation to another company controlled by the appellant, Clairmont Holdings and Finance Limited. This had been achieved through a formal Mandate Agreement which provided that Sinitus would act exclusively on written instructions from the appellant for an annual fee. Although there was no such formal agreement in evidence in relation to the role of Mr Meisterhans in the Stichting arrangements, the circumstantial evidence suggested that his practical function in the present matter was of the same character. Ms Harley described him as a ""fiduciary"" (Transcript 160-161). He acted as an agent carrying out the appellant's instructions. 

166There were a number of matters that demonstrated that the appellant was the controlling mind of the five companies. This is particularly so in relation to the sale of Admerex shares held within the Stichting Group Companies. There is no need to detail this evidence at this point. It will arise for further discussion in relation to other grounds of appeal. It is sufficient to note that, under the Deeds of Charge executed in favour of the appellant over the assets of the five companies, the companies could not deal with the Admerex shares without the appellant's written consent. The appellant was identified in documents as the beneficial owner of the assets held in the EFG and SwissFirst accounts, and, as we shall mention later, there was evidence to suggest that the appellant directed Mr Meisterhans in relation to selling both the Admerex and Temenos shares. There was also evidence as to the appellant's directions to Mr Meisterhans in relation to the disbursement of the proceeds of the sale of both Admerex and Temenos shares. There was no evidence that the Stichting Groups acted independently of the appellant, or of one another. 

167The central issues at trial were, first, whether Barat retained the beneficial ownership of the Admerex shares after June 2004, and secondly whether it disposed of the beneficial ownership in February 2005 by virtue of the share swap. As we have said, the direction sought would have been a complete distraction from these central issues and, in any event, did not relate to a circumstantial fact that itself required proof beyond reasonable doubt. Nor did the suggested direction relate to matters in proof of the elements of each offence. The trial judge, however, gave a very detailed direction to the jury on the ""controlling mind"" issue. No complaint has been made as to the adequacy of this direction. His Honour said (AB Vol 3 228-229): 

""It will be clear to you that a critical issue in the trial is whether the beneficial ownership of the 55 million Admerex shares remained with Barat Advisory after 11 June 2004, or whether it passed to the five overseas companies together with the legal interest in the shares. The Crown submits the beneficial interest in the shares remained with Barat. The defence submits, by reference to the five share transfer documents, that both the legal and beneficial interests in the shares passed to the five overseas companies on 11 June 2004. 

The Crown submits that the accused was the controlling mind of Barat and was also the controlling mind of the five overseas companies. In this way, the Crown submits that the accused was effectively dealing with himself. It was submitted that the accused intended that there was not to be any transfer of beneficial ownership to the five overseas companies, but that the beneficial ownership would be retained by Barat. 

The defence submits that you would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was the controlling mind of the five overseas companies. The evidence reveals that the directors of the five overseas companies were Mr Meisterhans and Gold Coast Directors Pty Ltd. The Crown contends that Mr Meisterhans was acting, in effect, as the agent of the accused so that you should conclude that the accused was the controlling mind of the five overseas companies. The defence submission is that you would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Meisterhans agreed to allow the accused to become the controlling mind of the five overseas companies. 

Having set the scene and reminded you of the arguments, I come to this particular direction .... In the circumstances of the case, it is necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt:- 

(a) the accused was the controlling mind of each of the five overseas companies, so that the intention of the accused was the intention of each of the five overseas companies, and 

(b) the intention of the accused, as the controlling mind of each of the five overseas companies, was that only the legal title and not the beneficial title, to the 55 million Admerex shares was to be transferred to the five overseas companies, those companies would hold the shares on trust for Barat. Because of the significance of the controlling mind issue in the case, those are the things which it is necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt. As will be clear to you, this issue relates to the beneficial ownership issue in the trial."" 

168The clarity and focus of this direction will be apparent. We consider that it was quite unnecessary for his Honour to give the additional direction sought. 

169We take the same view in relation to the direction referred to in ground 3 of the appeal. It was no part of the Crown case that the transactions were a sham. They were clearly established bone fide by Ms Harley in the belief that they would provide a genuine tax deferral for some ten years for the benefit of the appellant and Barat. The central issues at trial required the Crown to satisfy the jury that the intentions of the appellant in relation to the operation of the structures were dishonest. It did not require an attack on the structures themselves. The Crown sought to do this in the overall context of the circumstances both before and after the transfers rather than by the distraction of a consideration of the law relating to ""sham"". We agree with the Crown that the relevant issue was whether or not there had been a transfer of beneficial ownership in the shares, not whether the transaction was a technically, under tax law, a sham. The directions given by the trial judge focused upon this central issue. His Honour was correct in refusing to give the direction sought. 

Ground 6 

170Ground 6 alleges that there was a miscarriage of justice in the trial. Five particular matters are relied on and these are: 

(i) The Crown alleged for the first time after it had closed its case and thereafter submitted to the jury that the appellant was the controlling mind of the five companies. 

(ii) The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that they could not convict the appellant on either count unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the transfer of the shares from Barat Advisory to the five companies on 11 June 2004 had the attributes of sham agreements. 

(iii) The Crown did not call as a witness Mr Meisherhans, who was a material witness. 

(iv) His Honour erred in failing to direct the jury that it could not find as a fact that the appellant was the controlling mind of the five companies unless they were satisfied beyond doubt that the directors of those companies had abdicated their duties and responsibilities as directors. 

(v) The submissions made by the Crown in its final address to the jury concerning ""instrument of crime"" referred to matters which were irrelevant, distracting and prejudicial. 

171It will be apparent that a number of these particulars have been examined, albeit in a different context, earlier in these reasons. Accordingly, we shall deal with them in a relatively brief fashion. 

172Section 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act sets out the grounds on which an appeal may be allowed against conviction. One of the ""limbs"" ( DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63 at [44]) is the circumstance that there has been a miscarriage of justice. 

173If any of the three limbs in the section is established, s 6(1) provides that the Court ""shall allow the appeal"" subject to the proviso that, notwithstanding that the Court is of opinion that the points raised by the appeal ""might be decided in favour of the appellant, the Court may dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"". 

174It has been said that the ""miscarriage"" ground is a dragnet or residual provision: TKWJ v The Queen (2002) 2012 CLR 124 per McHugh J at [72]. Prior to the advent of criminal appeals statutes a ""miscarriage of justice"" was any departure from a trial according to law: Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [18]. It may be accepted that the term ""miscarriage of justice"" may encompass any one of a very wide variety of departures from a proper conduct of a trial: Nudd v R (2006) 80 ALJR 614 per Gummow and Hayne JJ at [24]. Inquiry about miscarriage must be an objective inquiry and the ultimate question is whether the act or omission relied upon resulted in a miscarriage of justice: Nudd at [27]. 

175The substance of particulars (ii) and (iv) have already been addressed. We do not accept that his Honour's ""failure"" to give the two directions sought by the defence constituted an error in process. Accordingly, there was no miscarriage of justice in relation to either of these two matters. 

176In relation to particular (i), we do not accept that the concept of the appellant being ""the controlling mind"" of the five overseas companies was a matter introduced for the first time after the Crown case had closed. We have had regard to the Crown case statement, to the Crown opening before the jury and to the cross-examination of Crown witnesses, especially Ms Harley. We conclude that, as the Crown argued on this appeal, it was always central to the prosecution case that the appellant controlled all aspects of the establishment and conduct of the Stichtings and the foreign companies, and of the disposal of the Admerex shares transferred to the foreign companies. To the extent that Ms Harley was involved in the establishment of the overseas arrangement, it was always the Crown case that she did so on the appellant's instructions. It was always the Crown case that the transfer of the Admerex shares to the Stichting groups was for the benefit of the appellant. Similarly, the prosecution case consistently maintained that Mr Meisherhans acted as the appellant's agent and acted on his instructions or the instructions of Ms Harvey who was the appellant's lawyer. 

177We do not consider that any error in process occurred in relation to this particular. We do not accept that the appellant lost the opportunity to cross-examine Ms Harley on the issue of the appellant's control. Ms Harley was effectively cross-examined by Mr Robberds to the effect that she genuinely believed that the legal and beneficial ownership of the shares had passed from Barat Advisory to the overseas companies in mid June 2004. We do not consider that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. 

178In relation to particular (iii), we do not consider that the absence of oral evidence from Mr Meisterhans resulted in any miscarriage of justice. In his closing address to the jury, Mr Robberds submitted that, without oral evidence from Meisterhans, the jury simply could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had abdicated his duties as a director by agreeing with the accused that the beneficial ownership of the Admerex shares would remain with Barat Advisory. At AB Vol 3 SU 33, his Honour told the jury: 

""During the course of the defence closing submissions, reference is made to the fact that the Crown has not called Mr Urs Meisterhans to give evidence. You can take the fact that there has been no evidence from Mr Meisterhans into account when you decide whether the Crown has proved the guilt of the accused. I am not inviting you to guess what Mr Meisterhans would have said if he had been called. You must not do that at all. But in a criminal trial, where the Crown must prove that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt, a jury is entitled to take into account that there was no evidence from a particular person in deciding whether or not there is a reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt."" 

179No objection was raised to this direction by the trial judge. It was repeated at summing up: AB Vol 3 SU 81. 

180Although not decisive on the point, we note that there had been an earlier pre-trial application in which the defence had sought an order that Mr Meisterhans be brought from Switzerland to give oral evidence at the trial. The trial judge had refused this application primarily on the basis that, based on recent amendments to the Foreign Evidence Act 1994, foreign business records would be admissible in a trial without the need for oral evidence from overseas witnesses in relation to those records. In general terms, the documentary material was, in any event, placed before the jury as a result of agreement between the Crown and defence legal teams. 

181The final matter relates to submissions made by the Crown in its final address to the jury. In relation to count 1, the Crown submitted that the actions of the appellant between June 2004 and September 2005 demonstrated his intention to use the Admerex shares as ""an instrument of crime"". In these submissions, the Crown referred to the establishment of the Stichtings and the overseas companies as ""a form of screen behind which the shares might be disposed of with limited risks of detection"". The Crown also submitted that the division of the shares into small parcels and their movement offshore by way of transfer to overseas companies ""assisted the screening of the ultimate swapping of the shares with the Temenos shares"". It also assisted, in that sense, in getting the funds from the sale of the Temenos shares back into Australia with a limited risk of detection which might assist in convincing the accountants to lodge the returns without a reference to the disposal of the Admerex shares. 

182In its submissions to the jury, the defence took issue with each of these matters. At SU 167, the trial judge summarises the defence submissions which essentially highlight the evidence of Ms Harley as to the genuineness of the Stichtings arrangement and the legitimacy in law of the intention to defer tax for some years. Moreover, the defence submissions highlighted, once again, the transfer of the legal and beneficial ownership to the five companies, as expressed in the documentation and in Ms Harley's evidence. 

183In its oral submissions before this Court, Mr Robberds clarified that his complaint did not extend to arguing that the Crown was not entitled to raise the matters it did. Rather, he argued that these were only relevant to the question of the appellant's intention. They were not relevant, counsel submitted, to the question whether, after the alleged share swap on 3 February 2005, the 48 million Admerex shares could become an instrument of crime. 

184We do not agree with this submission. It revisits the ground 1 particulars which raised for consideration the proper construction of s 400.3 of the Code . For the reasons we have given earlier, we would not hold that the matters referred to by the Crown in its arguments before the jury were irrelevant to the establishment of the offence in s 400.3 of the Code . The capacity of the shares to become an instrument of crime, and the appellant's intentions as to whether they would be so used, were inter-related matters. Moreover we do not consider that the Crown's submissions at trial raised any aspects of prejudice or unfairness to the appellant. As we have said, Mr Robberds, in his submissions to the jury, had little difficulty in advancing persuasive arguments to the contrary even though, as it happened, the jury apparently accepted that the Crown had made out its case beyond reasonable doubt. 

185We conclude that none of the matters relied on in ground 6 has been established. 

Grounds 4, 5 and 7 

186These grounds assert that the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable. In relation to count 1, it is said the verdict was unreasonable because, on the whole of the evidence, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on 3 February 2005 the appellant, on behalf of Barat, disposed of the Admerex shares by way of a swap. In particular, it was again asserted that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in 2004 the beneficial interest in the Admerex shares had not been transferred to the five overseas companies. 

187In relation to the second count, the verdict of the jury was claimed to be unreasonable for the same reasons. If Barat had passed the beneficial ownership in June 2004, the share swap in February 2005 was incapable of being a disposal for the purpose of the charge in the indictment. Additionally, the verdict was unreasonable on the basis that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there had been, in any event, a change of ownership of the 48 million Admerex shares in the financial year ended 30 June 2005. Any disposal, it was argued, occurred in the following financial year. 

188These grounds require an appreciation of the broad nature of both the Crown and defence case. They require also some attention to the detail of the trial, including a number of the competing arguments, although we propose, in that regard, to outline those matters in summary form. 

189We have earlier set out the broad nature of the Crown case. It is unnecessary to repeat the detail here. An examination of the conduct alleged in relation to counts 1 and 2 demonstrated, according to the trial judge in his remarks on sentence, two distinct periods of dishonesty, albeit with some degree of overlap. The underlying intention of the appellant throughout, according to the Crown case, was to avoid paying tax on any capital gain. In the first period, the intention was to use the Admerex shares in a criminal manner. The second period involved the lodgement of a tax return, accompanied as it was by associated dishonest behaviour and deceit in the appellant's dealings with his accountants. 

190The Crown case relied on the flow chart (exhibit A). This graphically demonstrated the involvement of the appellant in a controlling capacity throughout the entire period between 2003 to 2006. The Crown case, as we have said, critically raised two issues: 

(a) Did Barat Advisory retain beneficial ownership of the shares after the transfer of the legal ownership in June 2004, with the appellant being throughout the controlling mind of all the relevant entities, and with Mr Meisterhans acting effectively as his agent in carrying out his instructions? Put in another way, was it the appellant's intention to disregard the strict legalities of the Stichting Group structure so that he could, when the opportunity presented itself, dispose of the Admerex shares, thereby making a capital gain and keeping it without paying tax? 

(b) Was there a disposal of Admerex shares on or about 3 February 2005 so as to constitute a CGT event in the financial year ending 30 June 2005? 

191These two questions were interwoven: if Barat Advisory did not retain the beneficial ownership in 2004, there could not have arisen a CGT event in February 2005. If that were the situation, the verdicts on count 1 and 2 could not stand. There was, however, as earlier indicated in relation to the ground 1 particulars, a further issue that focused on count 2. This was whether the conversation between the two men on 3 February 2005 had evidenced a contract for the disposal of the shares. There was a related question whether the September 2005 ""disposal"" of the shares by Mr Goodall to a third party meant that any capital gain event occurred in the 2006 financial year rather than in the preceding financial year. This second question, however, only arose if the beneficial ownership of the shares had been retained by Barat Advisory at the time of the June 2004 transactions. 

192The Crown case had been that the appellant, at all relevant times, was deeply focused upon the issue as to how he could avoid paying tax on the Admerex shares. The Crown case asserted that, in the appellant's mind, the principal reason for the establishment of the overseas Stichtings and their associated companies was a need to defer tax and, if it could be achieved, to avoid the payment of Capital Gains Tax altogether. It was in this sense that the Crown argued at trial that the appellant had been guilty of dishonesty throughout the two periods of activity we have described, even though the dishonesty took different forms at different times. 

193The defence case, in some respects, operated in something of a parallel universe to all this. Throughout the trial, defence counsel had suggested that what was happening was altogether different from the perspective advocated by the Crown. This became a point of fundamental difference between the parties, a difference which it was necessary for the jury to resolve. 

194The focal point of the defence case was this: the 2004 arrangements involving Ms Harley, Mr Meisterhans and others came about as a consequence of the appellant's plans and preparation for corporate activity intended to bring about the takeover of Temenos. This was to be achieved by utilising the significant shareholding held by Goodall in that company. The defence urged the jury to find that in March 2004 Ms Harley had examined the takeover law in Switzerland at the appellant's request because he was giving consideration to a possible takeover by Admerex of Temenos. The appellant placed particular reliance on the evidence of Ms Harley where she agreed in cross-examination that the shares were transferred to the five overseas companies ""as part of getting ready to do something great with Temenos"". This became the central defence theme before the jury and, indeed, in this appeal. 

195Mr Robberds outlined a series of facts which he suggested supported this proposition. For example, in May 2004 the appellant met Mr Goodall in Singapore. At this meeting they decided to go ahead with their pursuit of Temenos. To that end, Mr Goodall telephoned a Mr Koukis who was the chairman of and a major shareholder in Temenos. Arrangements were made for the three men to meet in Geneva in the week commencing 7 June 2004. The defence case was that the reason for this proposed meeting was to enable the appellant and Mr Goodall to explore the possibility of coming to some arrangement with Mr Koukis so that Admerex could obtain the benefit of his shares and thus increase the possibility of a takeover of Temenos. 

196The appellant returned to Australia and, between 31 May and 6 June 2004, with the assistance of Ms Harley, the five Stichtings were established with the intention that they would hold one share each in five newly incorporated companies. These were incorporated in St Vincent and the Grenadines on 3 June 2004. The defence case was that the urgency in these arrangements arose because of the need for the structures to be in place before the appellant saw Mr Koukis in Geneva on 7 June. 

197Ms Harley had asked Mr Meisterhans, with whom she had worked before, to incorporate the five overseas companies. On 6 June the appellant and Ms Harley flew overseas and, during that week, met employees of Citco to finalise arrangements. Prior to leaving Australia, Ms Harley told the appellant that if the 55 million Admerex shares were sold by Barat to the five overseas companies, he would no longer have any beneficial interest in the shares. She told him, however, that he would have a financial interest pursuant to the Master Investment Futures Agreement and protected by a Deed of Charge. 

198It was common ground that on 11 June 2004 Barat Advisory sold and transferred the 55 million Admerex shares to the five companies, each of the companies receiving a specified number of those shares. Although no money was paid, it was contemplated that there would be loans in place in the nature of vendor finance. 

199Ms Harley gave evidence that she sought to achieve, by the documentation she had prepared, the consequence that the beneficial interest in the shares would be transferred to each of the five companies. She said that, as far as she was concerned, she had successfully achieved that objective. Thus it was the defence case, first, that the purpose of establishing the overseas structures was to enable the Admerex shares to be used so that ""something great"" could be done with Temenos, namely the advancement of a possible takeover or a merger. Secondly, that the beneficial ownership of the 55 million shares had, in any event, passed to the five overseas companies and that accordingly the events of February 2005 could not have resulted in a CGT event. 

200An alternative aspect of the defence case was that, even if the jury were to accept that the beneficial ownership of the Admerex shares had been retained by Barat Advisory after June 2004, the so-called ""share swap"" did not pass the beneficial ownership in February 2005. Rather, if that event occurred, contrary to the defence case, it did not occur until September 2005 when Mr Goodall arranged for the transfer of the shares to a third party. 

201It is necessary to say something in a little more detail in the context of the evidence relied upon for the purpose of the more detailed defence submissions. These highlighted a number of matters that may be summarised as follows: 

(a) All of the documentation prepared by Ms Harley asserted in express terms that the beneficial ownership of the Admerex shares was passed or had been passed: for example, the terms of the transfers themselves, the Master Futures Investment Agreement and each of the Deeds of Charge. 

(b) Given the evidence as to the integrity of Ms Harley and her favourable experience with Mr Meisterhans in the past, if the beneficial and legal ownership of the shares did not pass in June 2004, it must have been the situation that the whole structure was a sham and Meisterhans, and the other persons undertaking duties in relation to the Stichting Groups, must have entirely abdicated their responsibilities and duties. 

(c) While there had been certification tendered before the jury in which the appellant was stated to be the beneficial owner or ultimate beneficial owner, these were of no value and were completely explained by the evidence of Ms Harley. She had said that, in the case of Citco and the EFG Bank, she had effectively been placed in a situation where the certification were required even though she did not agree with their contents. It was ""non-negotiable"". There was no suggestion during the trial that Ms Harley was not fully truthful about these matters. Indeed, there was no attack upon her integrity in any real sense at all. 

(d) Mr Robberds submitted, both before the jury and this Court, that the ""most important evidence"" in the case was that of Ms Harley. She had prepared the documentation in complete good faith; she believed that it passed the beneficial ownership, and she had explained to the appellant various aspects of the proposed structure that would govern the transfer of the Admerex shares. She explained, for example, that the downside of the arrangement would be that the appellant ""would cease to have ownership of the shares"". If he went ahead with the arrangement, he would not have any beneficial ownership of the shares but his ""interests would be protected through the Master Investment Futures Agreement and the Deeds of Charge"". She told him that if he went ahead with the proposal the consequences would be that ""the shares would not be Barat Advisory shares any longer"". 

(e) In relation to the conversation on 3 February 2005, it was Goodall's evidence that there was no share swap because he ""denied"" that he agreed to the swap - ""he did not accept the 48 million Admerex shares"". On the basis of this evidence, the change in ownership did not occur until the end of September 2005 when Goodall arranged for the transfer of the shares. 

(f) Mr Meisterhans, during the period July 2004 to February 2005, had made a number of investment decisions in relation to the affairs of Challinor Equities. During this period he bought and sold other shares, currency, and invested money into fiduciary deposits. He made and repaid loans. The defence pointed to evidence that the sale of the Admerex shares during the latter half of 2004 resulted in the proceeds being placed in the Challinor Equities account. Apart from a payment for legal fees, these amounts remained in the account until later in 2005. 

202It is necessary now to briefly summarise the Crown response to the defence case and its response to many of the arguments we have briefly touched upon. Once again, we shall undertake this task in summary form. The thrust of the Crown response may be stated as follows: 

(a) The Crown accepted that there may have been, and undoubtedly was, some parallel corporate activity in 2004 involving the use of the Temenos shares owned by Goodall. However, that activity did not affect the appellant's intention to take steps in order to minimise, defer and, as it turned out, to avoid CGT on the disposal of the 55 million Admerex shares issued in April 2004 at no real cost to Barat Advisory. 

(b) The flaw in the defence case was that there was no demonstrable connection between any Temenos takeover activity and the transfer of the Admerex shares in five parcels to the foreign companies owned by the Stichtings. Nor was there any connection between Temenos takeover activity (such as it was) and the swap of the 48 million Admerex shares for Goodall's one million Temenos shares. It was never suggested, for example, that the Admerex shares acquired by the appellant through Barat Advisory in satisfaction of the original debt had any significant part to play in any proposed takeover or merger with Temenos. 

(c) The reference to Ms Harley's evidence in which she agreed with the proposition that shares were transferred to the five companies ""as part of getting ready to do something great with Temenos"" (whatever that might mean) carried negligible weight in the light of the more detailed evidence of the sequence of events concerning the failed venture involving Temenos. Importantly, however, this prospect had never involved the Admerex shares owned by Barat Advisory. In other words, the Crown response to the Temenos-based case sought to be made by the defence was that, upon examination, it had no substance whatsoever. 

(d) The Crown examined the evidence relating to Mrs Harley's advice. It suggested that the evidence clearly showed that the appellant had consulted Ms Harley for tax advice, not for corporate takeover advice, prior to her recommendation to set up the Stichtings. She had eventually given the appellant advice in writing in a draft document dated 4 August 2004. It was 18 pages in length and almost entirely dedicated to taxation issues concerning the most tax effective means of disposal of the Admerex shares. True it was that it contained a relatively small section dealing with compliance with the requirements for substantial shareholder notices. This, however, was in the context of an analysis of the ""associate"" provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act . It had no express connection with any takeover activity concerning Temenos. 

(e) The prosecution case throughout was that, whatever Ms Harley's intentions were, she had been deceived by the appellant as to the basis upon which the shares would be traded. For example, the tax advice recited instructions that the Stichting Group Companies would acquire the Admerex shares from the appellant ""on an independent basis"". It recited that they would have acquired ""our clients shares in Admerex from any entity if their expectations as to price were met"". The Crown submitted that this was simply not the case. The Stichting Group of Companies were specifically set up in the context of the appellant ""off loading"" the Admerex shares to them. There was never any evidence of independent advice, nor was there evidence of the prospect of the purchase of the Admerex shares from any other vendors. 

Similarly, the Crown argued that Ms Harley's recited instructions in her advice that each of the foreign companies would ""make separate and independent decisions in relation to the holding and disposal of the share parcels etc"" demonstrated the same point. This was never going to be the case. The Stichtings and the foreign companies were directly controlled by the appellant. All decisions were made by him concerning the acquisition and disposal of the Admerex shares collectively, rather than by reference to any considerations or individual decisions made independently by each Stichting and foreign company. 

(f) That the purpose of the appellant consulting with Ms Harley, and that the object of her suggested arrangements, were tax driven was supported by the detail of her firm's bill of costs for the relevant period. It was plainly not the case that these arrangements related to a takeover. Clearly the entire situation was ""tax driven"". 

(g) The Crown did not dispute Ms Harley's evidence that she and Mr Meisterhans had been, in effect, obliged to provide both Citco and the EFG with the bank certifications as to beneficial ownership. However, the Crown submitted before the jury that this might properly be seen as a recognition of the fact that all the arrangements were for the appellant's ultimate benefit. The certifications provided material that went circumstantially to the issue of the appellant's de facto control in the period between June 2004 and the end of the financial year 2005. 

(h) The evidence that the beneficial ownership remained with Barat Advisory and hence under the control of the appellant included the following. First, the shares, after transfer, were controlled through five EFG Swiss bank accounts established by Mr Meisterhans for which he had identified the appellant as the beneficial owner. Secondly, the early sales of the Admerex shares commenced on 1 July 2004 and continued until 18 November 2004. On that date the appellant sent an email to Mr Meisterhans directing him to ""stop"" because the quantities advised were ""putting pressure on the market and bringing the price down"". Thirdly, Mr Meisterhans acquiesced in this direction. Fourthly, between those dates over 6 million Admerex shares were sold out of the EFG bank account in the name of Challinor Equities, and on 13 July 2005 some $509,000 from the proceeds of sale was transferred to a UBS Zurich account also in the name of Challinor Equities. From this account, in 2005, payments were made to the CBA account in Australia in the name of Barat Advisory, and other payments were made for the personal benefit of the appellant. The Crown submitted that this evidence could easily satisfy the jury that the appellant had been the beneficiary from the outset of the proceeds of the initial sale of the 6 million or so Admerex shares sold between July and November 2004. 

Moreover, it was argued that the swap itself and the subsequent dealings with the proceeds of the sale of the Temenos shares demonstrated that it was the appellant who made the initial decision that the shares would be exchanged. He took all the initiatives in this regard, and he was the person behind Mr Meisterhans in causing all the subsequent arrangements to be made. 

There was also the fact that, in the events that happened, the appellant completely ignored the obligations imposed on him under the careful documentation presented by Ms Harley. The appellant ignored the obligation to make an annual payment in each year in respect of the shortfall equivalent to 10 per cent of the committed capital of the company in each case. He ignored the elaborate provisions relating to the obligations of the Stichtings on the termination date of 1 July 2005. Indeed, there was no effort made to wait for the termination date before any payment was made by each company to the Stichting. No effort was made to calculate the amounts payable in accordance with the terms of the agreements. The Crown submitted that, as soon as the swap was made, the Temenos shares were sold off and the proceeds returned ultimately to Barat Advisory's accounts without any regard whatsoever to the obligations of the Stichting structure. Effectively, the appellant tore up Ms Harley's advice and ignored her careful arrangements. 

(i) Finally, the Crown disputed the interpretation of Mr Goodall's evidence that was said to deny the existence of a CGT event. Reference was also made to emails passing between Mr Meisterhans and Ms Harley which confirmed that a contract for the swap had taken place on 3 February 2005. 

203We turn now to resolve these competing submissions. 

204The task of the Court of Criminal Appeal in an ""unreasonableness"" appeal has recently been restated by the High Court of Australia in SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 85 ALJR 571. In the plurality judgment of French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ, it was stated at [11]-[14]: 

""11 It is agreed between the parties that the relevant function to be performed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in determining an appeal, such as that of the applicant, is as stated in M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ: 

Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. 

12 This test has been restated to reflect the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. In MFA v R ( 2002) 213 CLR 606 at [58], McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ stated that the reference to ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"" in M is to be taken as ""equivalent to the statutory formula referring to the impugned verdict as 'unreasonable' or such as 'cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence'."" 

13 T he starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say (at 494): 

In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. 

.... 

14 In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act , by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA , the court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"" ( Morris v R (1987) 163 CLR 454 at 473). In M , Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated (at 492-493): 

'In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ""none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'."" 

205In the present matter, having regard to the grounds of appeal relied on by the appellant, it is this court's task to make an independent assessment of the whole of the evidence, paying special attention to those matters relied upon by the appellant in its submission, to determine whether the finding of guilt by the jury can be supported. 

206In making it own assessment, this Court must, however bear in mind the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence and, in that regard, the jury will have had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses: M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493. The only witness whose credit or reliability was attacked was Mr Goodall. We bear in mind this qualification in relation to our examination of his evidence. 

207We have given careful consideration to the submissions advanced by Mr Robberds QC but we have concluded that, in our assessment, the verdicts of the jury were not unreasonable. We shall briefly state our reasons. 

208Although the defence sought to place considerable reliance on Ms Harley's evidence, we do not consider it carries the weight sought to be attributed to it. There can be no doubt that Ms Harley acted bone fide in establishing a tax deferral structure that required, for its effective operation the transfer of the legal and beneficial ownership of the Admerex shares. There can be no doubt that Ms Harley genuinely believed that the scheme she organised and arranged had achieved that result. We do not accept, however, that the scheme was driven by Ms Harley or that it was her initiative. Nor do we accept that its primary purpose, in the appellant's mind, was to enable the appellant ""to do something great with Temenos"". 

209It is true that in March 2004 Ms Harley sent an email to the appellant providing advice concerning the takeover law applicable in Switzerland. However, the appellant's attendance upon Ms Harley shortly before early June 2004 related to the 55 million Admerex shares. Although pushed in cross-examination by Senior Counsel for the appellant, Ms Harley resisted the notion that she had been the person driving either the advice or the transaction. At transcript 168 Ms Harley said: 

""I didn't tell him how it should be done. That is, um, I was asked to give some input in terms of how the investment could be structured on the basis that it was quite likely that a buyer for the shares would not be an Australian entity and there would be a value to such a person, buyer, if they could buy it in a way which didn't trigger some corporation issues or taxation law issues. But I was not driving the investment in that way ..."" 

210Earlier she had told the Crown Prosecutor, concerning her advice, that the appellant's view of the company was that in the future it would be of ""greater value"" than it was at the time of their discussion. She discussed structuring the investment ""so as to on the one hand have tax advantages, or at least not tax disadvantages, but also to prepare the share parcels for sale to someone who may not be an Australian resident"" (Transcript 115). The advice, in short, was that the appellant should transfer the shares to an off shore entity that was not an entity connected with the appellant, and that he should continue to have a financial interest in the assets without having an ownership interest (Transcript 115, 25-30). It was in that context that the use of a Dutch entity called a Stichting was discussed. 

211We have [at 37 above] provided a summary of Ms Harley's advice to the appellant. We should repeat the thrust of it here. Ms Harley advised: 

(a) there would be tax payable on the initial disposal of the shares, but during the term of the arrangement there would be no tax liability; 

(b) the appellant would not be entitled to any asset of any Stichting Group until after the determination of the Stichting Group structure; 

(c) for both company law and taxation purposes, neither the Stichtings nor the Stichting Group companies were associated; 

(d) none of the Stichting Group companies was required to lodge a substantial share holder notice and subsequent disposal of Admerex shares by the Stichting Group companies would, so long as Admerex remained listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, be free of Capital Gains Tax; 

(e) any payment the appellant would receive upon the termination of the Stichting Group structure would be subject to Capital Gains Tax in Australia if that payment represented a capital gain on the value of the assets which had been held in that Stichting Group; and 

(f) the Stichting Group companies were required to act independently of the appellant and independently of each other. 

212Contrary to the submissions of the appellant, it seems overwhelmingly to be the case that the major thrust of Ms Harley's advice was tax driven. This appears plainly enough from the terms of the advice itself (Exhibit C1) and from the firm's Bill of Costs for the relevant period. The advice was some 18 pages in length. As the Crown submitted, it was almost entirely devoted to issues related to the most tax effective means of disposal of the Admerex shares. It is particularly significant that no part of the advice had any express connection with any takeover activity concerning Temenos. The topic was simply not mentioned. There was a relatively brief section dealing with compliance with the requirements for substantial shareholder notices. This was, however, in the context of an analysis of the ""associate"" provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act. The Bill of Costs contains some nine items relating to ""tax advice"" during the period 7 June to 11 June 2004 when the Stichtings arrangements were put in place. There is no reference to any other type of advice being given during that period. There is no mention of any proposal to takeover Temenos. 

213It cannot be gainsaid, however, that there was some evidence suggesting a possibility of some parallel corporate activity in 2004 involving the use of the Temenos shares owned by Goodall. In his evidence, Mr Goodall agreed that he had arranged for the appellant to meet Mr Koukis in Geneva but he was emphatic that there was no established plan for a takeover or merger. Rather, he said, this was simply a preliminary meeting well prior to any takeover discussions. There was no tangible outcome to the meeting. The concept remained on foot but it was ""still in the embryonic stage"" (Transcript 247). 

214As was submitted, the weakness in the defence case was that there was no real connection between the Temenos takeover possibility and the transfer of the Admerex shares to the foreign companies owned by the Stichtings. Nor was there any connection between ""doing something great with Temenos"" and the swap of the 48 million Admerex shares for Mr Goodall's 1 million Temenos shares. There was no evidence to suggest, for example, that the Admerex shares acquired by the appellant through Barat Advisory in satisfaction of the original debt had any significant part to play in any possible takeover or merger with Temenos. Eventually, the possibility of a Temenos type venture failed completely, but at no time did it feature or rely upon the Admerex shares owned by Barat Advisory. 

215This conclusion is also made clear when regard is had to the swap of the Admerex shares for the Temenos shares on 3 February 2005. This transaction was, as the Crown argued, revenue neutral in that the respective parcels of shares had approximately the same value. There was, it must be said, a much more compelling explanation for the swap, namely that it was the final step in a scheme which had included the establishment of the Stichting Group structure for the purpose of diverting attention from the Admerex shares and thus enabling their ultimate disposal in a manner that would help avoid the detection of a capital gain. 

216The issue as to whether the appellant intended to retain the beneficial ownership of the shares is clearly resolved in the Crown's favour when regard is had to his activities after June 2004. It is these circumstances which compel the conclusion that the appellant intended to and did retain the beneficial ownership. There is no doubt that the concepts of a financial interest and a beneficial interest in the shares involve a real distinction. The appellant's actions, however, ignored that distinction. Of special significance were those actions which demonstrated that the appellant did not regard himself as bound by the advice he had been given by Ms Harley. Contrary to the defence submissions, Ms Harley's arrangements represented a genuine structure and could not be classified as a sham. The appellant's actions, however, demonstrated that he intended to ignore the structure and intended to treat himself (through Barat Advisory) as the beneficial owner. 

217It is necessary to digress to say something briefly about the role of Mr Meisterhans. The evidence from Ms Harley was that she had introduced the appellant to Meisterhans in June 2004. However, it is clear that the appellant had earlier commercial dealings with Mr Meisterhans. They were not without significance. The arrangements between Sinitus and Clairmont in 2003 included the Mandate Agreement. By its terms Sinitus was to act as directors/or officers of Clairmont but was required to act exclusively on instructions received from the appellant or his Attorney. Whether or not the two men had met face to face before, it was clear that Mr Meisterhans had, in these previous commercial transactions, acted effectively as agent for the appellant whilst acting as a director for one of his companies. It is true that no Mandate Agreement operated in the June 2004 structure. However, Mr Meisterhans was well used to taking instructions from the appellant. He was well used to acting as his agent in commercial transactions. The circumstances following June 2004 demonstrated that this type of relationship continued to operate between them, notwithstanding the absence of a Mandate Agreement or its equivalent. 

218Ms Harley intended, of course, that the Stichting Group companies would acquire the Admerex shares from the appellant ""on an independent basis"". As we have said earlier, however, there was no evidence of independent advice nor was there the prospect of the purchase of Admerex shares from any other vendor or vendors. Moreover, the Stichting Group companies were specifically set up to enable the appellant to transfer the shares to them with a tax deferral scheme in mind. None of this made the scheme bogus. But it reinforced, as later events showed, that the appellant did not intend to be bound by the structure. Quite to the contrary, he controlled the disposal of the shares throughout and gave instructions to Mr Meisterhans which were readily carried out on his behalf. This extended to the disbursement of the proceeds of the sale of the Admerex shares. 

219There were at least three matters of significance in 2004. The first was the appellant's signing of the declaration as to the source of funds for Citco's purposes. This document had identified the appellant as the beneficial owner of funds used to establish the Stichtings, and the funds which might from time to time be transferred into the names of the Stichtings. Ms Harley gave evidence that she was obliged to have this done even though she herself did not think that it was correct. Similarly, the appellant was identified as the beneficial owner of assets in the paperwork which opened accounts on 15 June 2004 in the name of each of the Stichting Group companies with EFG Bank. Mr Meisterhans opened these accounts, he being the sole signatory. Once again, Ms Harley's evidence was that this was an obligatory requirement by the bank rather than the statement of the true position. However, it was evidence, we accept, that supported the notion that, from the appellant's perspective, he saw himself as the person who had the ultimate control over the practical operation of the structures. Events to which we now refer demonstrate that he carried this belief into practice. 

220Between 1 July 2004 and 18 November 2004 there was a spate of selling of the Admerex shares. On 18 November, the appellant emailed Mr Meisterhans from his Blackberry. He gave him peremptory instructions to revoke current orders for the sale of Admerex shares. The language and tone of the email made it quite clear that he was simply ordering Mr Meisterhans to carry out the directions and that is precisely what happened. There were various arguments advanced by Mr Robberds to suggest that this interpretation should not be put on the terms of the email. We regard its terms, however, and more significantly the response by Mr Meisterhans as indicating clearly that both men treated the appellant as beneficial owner and in control of the disposal of the shares. This was much more than the protection of an investment by a person with a financial interest. 

221Secondly, between July and 18 November 2004 some 6 million Admerex shares had been sold. It is clear that, although the monies were not immediately transferred over to the benefit of Mr Milne, they remained available to him until they were ultimately transferred to a UBS Zurich account in the name of Challinor Equities from which payments were thereafter made to a CBA account in Australia in the name of Barat Advisory. 

222Thirdly, there was the share swap itself. Although the Admerex shares were not transferred at the request of Mr Goodall until September 2005, it is clear that the actions of Mr Meisterhans in February 2005 recognised both the instructions given to him by the appellant and the implications of the swap. Mr Meisterhans' actions in transferring 1 million Temenos shares into the Challinor Equities SwissFirst Bank account, the subsequent sales and the disposal of the consequent funds to or for the benefit of the appellant, was a recognition that, in accordance with the appellant's instructions, the Admerex shares had been disposed of without any independent or separate consideration being given to the transaction by the Stichtings Group companies. Moreover, the direction given to Mr Meisterhans indicated a decision that had been made by the appellant to pass the benefit of the Admerex shares to Mr Goodall. 

223Mr Meisterhans' email to Ms Harley (copy to the appellant) on 8 September 2005 referred to the events of 2 and 3 February 2005: 

""On 2 February 2005 the termination agreement for the letter of intent was signed between Admerex (Ireland) Limited and SwissFirst Bank AG under which Admerex (Ireland) Limited continued to retain a total of 3 million T shares (originally 5 million). One million T shares were consequently returned by SwissFirst to EFG in favour of Kim while 1 million shares were swapped against 48 million shares in Admerex Limited: that 1 million shares were transferred to Challinor's account with SwissFirst while the 4 St. Vincent companies continued to hold 48 million Admerex shares with EFG on behalf of Kim"". 

224In the email Mr Meisterhans confirmed that it was his understanding at the time that ""all conditions for the swap had been met"". He sought instructions from both Ms Harley (and the appellant) to make delivery of the 48 million Admerex shares to Mr Goodall. Presumably, clearance was given because, as we have mentioned, Mr Goodall then proceeded to arrange for the transfer of the shares to a third party. 

225We conclude that the appellant intended to and did retain beneficial ownership of the shares following the June 2004 transfers and that thereafter he gave instructions to Mr Meisterhans from time to time in relation to the disposal of shares. In relation to all those instructions, Mr Meisterhans complied and acted as if he were bound to do so. The appellant's deliberate contraventions of the structures set up by Ms Harley further evidence the true situation. 

226We turn then to the conversation between the appellant and Mr Goodall. The terms of the conversation, it must be said, were rather unusual. In one sense, the appellant's remarks were more in the nature of a direction or a command to Mr Goodall. However, there was nothing in the language used by Mr Goodall to suggest that he did not accept the statement that he (Goodall) would get a million Temenos shares back and that the appellant would take a million Temenos shares for his 49 million Admerex shares. The conversation refers to the ""renegotiation"" of a deal. It seemed to be common ground between the parties, however, that this was a reference to the re-arrangements of the finance facility with SwissFirst. It was not a reference to the swap. Mr Robberds submitted that Mr Goodall's evidence demonstrated that there was no share swap because he had ""denied"" that he agreed to the swap. This appears to be a reference to Mr Goodall's evidence at Transcript 235 lines 25-50: 

""Q. In the time between Mr Milne ringing you to say that he would take a million of your Temenos shares and you would have 49 million of the Admerex shares and the occasion when Mr Milne said to you 'I want you to look at a document', had you done anything or had anything been done, to your knowledge, in relation to transferring shares either your Temenos shares or the Admerex shares? 
A. I had suspected that something may have happened to the ... 

Q. Rather than what you suspected, could you tell us what had happened or what you had observed in relation to the shares? 
A. A number of transactions took place. My banker had advised me one million shares had gone back to my bank and at that time it appeared that somebody else had control of the Admerex (Ireland) bank account. 

Q. Who was your banker? 
A. Robert Mehm of EFG Bank in Geneva. 

Q. When did he inform you about the shares going back to the bank? 
A. I don't know, I don't remember the dates. 

Q. Before the meeting you had spoken about with Mr Milne? 
A. Yes 

Q. Had you done anything in relation to accepting 48 or 49 million Admerex shares? 
A. No I had not. 

Q. Had you done anything yourself about transferring or assigning 1 million Temenos shares to Mr Milne or anyone associated with him? 
A. No sir."" 

227At Transcript 236, Mr Goodall said that eventually he arranged for the transfer of the 48 million Admerex shares to a third party. He asked Mr Mehm at EFG Bank to find a third party. He said that he had ""more than enough Admerex shares ... didn't want any more Admerex shares"". 

228At Transcript 237, in relation to the 1 million Temenos shares he said he had not done anything to assign them or transfer them ""... it was just done"". 

229We do not consider that this evidence represents a denial by Mr Goodall that a share swap occurred. Rather, it seems a recognition on his part that the Admerex shares remained to be used by him whenever he chose to do so, whereas the 1 million Temenos shares had been transferred to the appellant without anything being done on his (Goodall's) part - ""it was just done"". 

230The final issue relates to the proposition that no CGT event occurred on 3 February 2005 and that, if there were such an event, it did not occur until September 2005. We do not accept on the facts that this is what happened. Section 104.5 of the ITA Act 1997 makes it clear that a CGT asset is disposed off when the disposal contract is entered into or, if none, when the relevant entity ""stops being the assets owner"". We consider that the circumstances we have outlined plainly show that there was a disposal contract entered into on 3 February 2005. For example, the actions of the appellant, in instructing Mr Meisterhans to transfer the 1 million Temenos shares for his benefit demonstrate that, from his perspective, Barat Advisory had ceased to be the owner of the Admerex shares. There could be no clearer admission on his part that this was the case. There was no suggestion he would hold both parcels of the shares. Equally, Mr Goodall's passivity in allowing the transfer of the 1 million Temenos shares for the benefit of the appellant demonstrated his tacit acceptance that he had ceased to be the owner of those assets. 

231In addition to the tax direction the trial judge gave to the jury, there was a separate direction given at the conclusion of the summing up. This was described as a direction to address ""the contract issue"". This further direction was in these terms: 

""Now, with respect to the contract issue, I want to give you this further direction. In the circumstance of the case, it is necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the 48 million Admerex shares were disposed off on or around the 3 rd of February 2005 because the accused, on behalf of Barat Advisory, entered into a contract with Mr Goodall to transfer the shares to him. And as I have said just a moment ago, there are various ways in which a contract may come into existence. It does not have to be only in the form of a document, described as a contract which contains the terms of the contract. A contract may arise from words spoken, as well as the contents of documents, or a combination of the two. A contract does arise if there is an offer, and an acceptance of the offer, so that it can be said there is a settled agreement between the parties, even if parts of the contract are to be performed at a later time"". 

No criticism has been made of this direction. We are satisfied on our own independent examination of the evidence that there was a CGT event on 3 February 2005 and that consequently it occurred in the financial year ending 30 June 2005. This is so, notwithstanding that the shares were not transferred to the third party until September 2005. 

232Having made an independent assessment of the evidence, and having examined with care the submissions of Mr Robberds on these grounds, we conclude that we have no doubt as to the guilt of the accused. For that reason, we conclude, as a matter of fact, that it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt in relation to both counts 1 and 2. We would dismiss these grounds of appeal. 

Sentence Appeal 

233We turn now to consider the sentence appeal. There are some 23 grounds of appeal, although there is a considerable degree of overlap and restatement in a number of the grounds. Before considering the grounds of appeal, we shall briefly say something about the trial judge's remarks on sentence. At the outset of these reasons, we indicated that the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment on count 1 for a period of 7 years and on count 2 to a period of 3 years and 6 months. There was a degree of accumulation between the two sentences so that the ultimate expiry date set was 16 June 2019. The effective overall term of the sentences was 8 years and 6 months. A single non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months was imposed. 

Remarks on Sentence 

234In his remarks on sentence, the trial judge drew together the complex of factual matters underlying both charges and summarised once again the principal arguments where there were contests of fact between the prosecution and defence. He resolved these conflicts for the purposes of making findings relevant to the sentencing exercise. 

235In that regard, his Honour stated his satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt about a number of matters as follows: 

(a) The term ""windfall"" (used by the Crown at trial and in the context of sentencing submissions) was apt to describe the substantial benefit which the appellant obtained in 2003 for a modest outlay of $1. the need to take action, in the appellant's own interests, for tax purposes arising from the ""windfall"" lay behind the events which followed. 

(b) The appellant's approach to Ms Harley for advice which culminated in the Stichting group structures was primarily tax driven. 

(c) The appellant and Mr Meisterhans knew of the existence of each other through the earlier role played by Sinitus in the business and corporate affairs of the appellant. 

(d) Ms Harley's understanding (that the Stichting group structure was designed to see both the legal and the beneficial ownership in the shares passed to each overseas company) was based upon the appellant acting in a manner which was consistent with those arrangements. However, the appellant did not act in that way and this circumstance shed light upon his state of mind when the arrangements were put in place in June 2004. 

(e) The appellant did not wish to lose control over the 55 million Admerex shares in June 2004. The documents signed by the appellant and by Mr Meisterhans which identified the appellant as the beneficial owner of the shares reflected the true position at that time in the mind of the appellant. 

(f) At the time of the creation of the Stichting group structures in June 2004, it was the appellant's intention that he, through Barat Advisory, would maintain beneficial ownership of the 55 million Admerex shares and thus maintain control over them, notwithstanding the passing of the legal title. 

(g) The appellant was, at all relevant times in 2004 and 2005, the controlling mind of Barat Advisory and the controlling mind of the 5 overseas companies. The appellant effectively controlled the latter companies through Mr Meisterhans. It was his intention that the 5 overseas companies would hold the 55 million Admerex shares on trust for Barat Advisory. 

236Against the background of these findings, his Honour examined and assessed the criminality involved in the commission of each offence. In relation to count 1, his Honour found that the factual matters constituting the money laundering offence included a series of steps taken by the appellant, one after the other, over a period of months, involving intentional criminal wrongdoing on his part and an intention that the shares would be used in the future to facilitate the commission of an offence by Barat Advisory. The appellant's subsequent misuse of the Stichting group structure (and his failure to adhere to the structure) was part of the factual matrix leading to the verdict of guilty on the first count. Thereafter, the appellant took the opportunity, when the opportunity presented itself on 3 February 2005, to exchange the Admerex shares for the Temenos shares. This occurred, his Honour found, in circumstances where the appellant believed that the Stichting group structure would conceal Barat Advisory's beneficial ownership of the Admerex shares and facilitate the non disclosure of the capital gain in order to avoid the payment of tax. His Honour said (ROS paras 172, 173): 

""The offender's actions involved a systematic and deliberate course of conduct, intended to gain a CGT advantage for Barat Advisory. 

The offender is guilty of the offence in the first count without regard being had to his deliberate deception of the Grant Thornton Accountants, and his ultimate dishonest act in causing to be lodged, in November 2006, an intentionally false tax return for Barat Advisory. That said, the fact that the offender acted in a deliberate and dishonest way in his dealings with the Grant Thornton accountants and by causing to be lodged a knowingly false tax return, sheds light upon the offender's motivation in the period between April 2004 and September 2005 when the money laundering offence was committed."" 

237His Honour concluded, in relation to count 1 that the appellant had exercised, at all relevant times, control over the 55 million Admerex shares, 48 million of which came to be swapped on or around 3 February 2005 for the Temenos shares, the proceeds of sale of which were then directed to his benefits. 

238In relation to the criminality in count 2 his Honour said (ROS 180, 181): 

""... the jury's verdict leads to the stark conclusion that the conduct of the offender in his dealings with the Grant Thornton accountants, over a period of months, was dishonest and deliberate, culminating in the signing by the offender of the relevant return, to be lodged with the ATO, containing that false statement. 

The dishonest statement was false in a gross respect in that the net capital gain from the sale of the Admerex shares was not $4,597, but a sum of at least $6.5 million."" 

239The trial judge then gave close consideration to the submissions relating to the related issues of overlapping criminality and double punishment. The Crown accepted, in its arguments, that there was an overlap between the appellant's criminality in relation to the two counts. This meant that the Court was obliged, after first determining the appropriate penalty for each offence, to consider questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality. The Crown further accepted that, to the extent that both counts had common elements, the appellant should not be punished twice for those common elements. However, the Crown submitted that the sentences should properly reflect any additional criminality which arose from any particular count. Essentially, the Crown submitted that the money laundering charge was directed to separate earlier conduct in which the appellant had arranged for and misused an elaborate and sophisticated offshore structure in order to facilitate, at some future time, the evasion of capital gains tax arising from the disposal of the Admerex shares in exchange for Temenos shares on or around 3 February 2005. By way of contrast, the s 135.1(1) charge was directed to the subsequent conduct of the appellant, culminating in the event on 13 November 2006, when the tax return for Barat Advisory was lodged without disclosing the capital gain on the disposal of the shares. 

240For these reasons, the Crown had submitted to the trial judge that the money laundering offence involved significant additional criminality over and above the criminality involved in the appellant's subsequent lodgement of the false tax return, and that such additional criminality should be reflected in the sentences to be imposed. 

241Mr Robberds made contrary submissions to these. He argued before the trial judge that there were no remnants of criminality in the money laundering offence which added to the culpability of the appellant's conduct involved in the second count. Senior Counsel had submitted that the offences were not, in any event, freestanding. There was, he argued, an intimate link between the two counts, in that the money laundering offence was the means by which the dishonest obtaining offence was facilitated. For that reason, the money laundering offence added nothing to the dishonest obtaining offence, so that there should be no separate sentence imposed for the money laundering offence, or that such a sentence should be entirely concurrent with the sentence imposed for the second count. If there were any additional criminality involved in the money laundering count, Mr Robberds submitted that it was ""minimal"". 

242Consequent upon these submissions, Mr Robberds also argued that if the Court found that there was any additional and significant criminality in the money laundering offence, then the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years for the dishonest obtaining offence was relevant. This was because the seriousness of the substantive offence in the second count ought reflect on the seriousness of the money laundering offence in the first count. In practical terms, the submission was that there was no warrant for a separate sentence on the money laundering count which itself exceeded the maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment available on the second count. 

243There were other submissions as well but these were the major matters put on the appellant's behalf. 

244His Honour rejected the defence submissions and preferred those of the Crown. It is appropriate to set out his Honour's finding (ROS 195-198 in full): 

""195. There is a clear overlap between the two offences. However, the offence contained in the first count, in my view, involved significant additional criminality to be assessed, for sentencing purposes, apart from the criminality involved in the second count. The conduct of the Offender in erecting the Stichting Group structure, with the assistance of Ms Harley, was always intended by the Offender to have favourable tax consequences for him and Barat Advisory. However, the conduct of the Offender went beyond the implementation of the model advised by Ms Harley. The Offender utilised and misused Ms Harley's model, in a way which involved Mr Meisterhans acting as the agent of the Offender and at his direction in a number of respects, all of which was intended to ensure that the Offender maintained practical control over the 55 million Admerex shares in and after June 2004. The Offender intended to take advantage of the Stichting Group structure, when an opportunity presented itself, by using the 55 million Admerex shares over which he maintained control, to benefit himself and Barat Advisory and to evade the capital gains consequences which he expected to apply. 

196. It is correct to say that capital gains tax was payable because of the CGT Event on or around 3 February 2005 when the share swap occurred, so that this event was linked to the false statement made in the Barat Advisory tax return lodged in November 2006. However, this does not mean that these aspects ought all be included under the umbrella of criminality surrounding the second count. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Offender did erect an elaborate and sophisticated offshore structure as submitted by the Crown. This process involved an elaborate rerouting of shares, and ultimately funds, to assist the intentional wrongdoing of the Offender contained in the first count. 

197. In my view, it would be wrong to approach the sentencing of the Offender upon the basis that all the circumstances which bear upon his criminal conduct in the period from April 2004 to November 2006 should all be placed under the umbrella of criminality surrounding the second count. There is, in my view, a substantial element of additional criminality revealed with respect to the first count, so that a significant sentence ought be imposed for that crime. 

198. Of course, it will be necessary for the Court to have regard to principles of concurrency, cumulation and totality in the imposition of sentence. However, I am satisfied that the sentences which I will pass do not give rise to any injustice to the Offender because of double punishment for separate offences. Rather, the sentences to be imposed will reflect the criminality for each offence, with the final total sentence reflecting the total criminality revealed in the offences for which the Offender was found guilty by the jury."" 

245Having dealt with these arguments, the trial judge turned to consider the subjective case advanced on behalf of the appellant. It was, as might be expected, a significant one. The appellant had been born in 1955 and had reached his then age without any criminal convictions whatsoever. There were ample character testimonials given on his behalf, all of which referred to his successful career in business over many years and to his general reputation as being an honest and honourable person. He was described as being ""a hardworking man who had provided well for his family"". 

246The trial judge accepted that the appellant was a man of good character. He accepted that his prospects of re-offending were ""very low"". By contrast his prospects of rehabilitation were described as ""good"". 

247His Honour then considered a number of the matters he thought to be of relevance arising under s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). In relation to the nature and circumstances of the offence, he said: 

""I am satisfied that the second count constitutes a very serious example of a dishonest obtaining offence. I am also satisfied that the first count represents a serious example of a money laundering offence, involving the establishment and misuse of a sophisticated offshore structure for the specific purpose of avoiding the payment by Barat Advisory of a substantial amount of tax."" 

248His Honour noted that the capital gains tax avoided was in the sum of at least $1,964,727. He was not satisfied that the appellant had any contrition for the offences. There were a number of other generally non-contentious matters which his Honour considered and about which he reached conclusions. These included the extent to which the appellant's good character was of assistance in the sentencing process; the need to send a message of general deterrence and the Court's need to protect the integrity of the revenue system by imposing punishments for deliberate dishonesty which would be likely to deter others; and the fact that the admissions made on the appellant's behalf and the general conduct of his legal representatives entitled him to consideration in that regard as demonstrating a willingness to facilitate the course of justice and to reduce the cost and the demands on the community by significantly shortening the trial. 

249Finally his Honour turned to consider the selection of an appropriate non-parole period appropriate to the circumstances. In this regard, his Honour placed reliance upon remarks in a recent decision of the High Court in Hili v R ; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 272 ALR 465. His Honour determined the sentences should be concurrent for two years and cumulative as to one year and six months. This meant that the total period of imprisonment would be one of 8 years and 6 months. His Honour said that he proposed to set a single non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months. In that regard he said he was ""satisfied that this is the minimum period the offender should spend in prison having regard to all the elements of punishment including the objective seriousness of his crime, specific and general deterrence, denunciation and the offender's subjective circumstances, including his good prospects of rehabilitation"". 

250His Honour then imposed the sentences to which we have made reference at the outset of these reasons. 

Ground 1 (Sentence Appeal) 

251The trial judge is said to have erred in his remarks on sentence when he stated that the applicant ""sought advice from Ms Harley as to how the 55 million Admerex shares could be moved offshore and placed within a structure to facilitate the sale of those shares to offshore investors"". 

252We have referred (para 188) to Ms Harley's evidence relating to her discussions with the appellant. Ms Harley had also said that she had given the appellant advice in relation to transferring the shares to ""an offshore"" entity. We agree with the Crown that, on this evidence, it was open to the trial judge, especially in the context of his lengthy summary of the background facts, to summarise the overall effect of the evidence in the manner his Honour did. Mr Robberds maintained that there was a significant difference between the concepts of asking how to prepare the shares for sale to a non-Australian resident, and asking how the shares could be move offshore. We accept that there may be a difference but the difference is slight and could have made no difference to the outcome of the sentencing exercise. We do not consider that any error has occurred. 

Ground 2 (Sentence Appeal) 

253Mr Robberds took issue with the trial judge's finding that the applicant obtained a substantial benefit in 2003 for a modest outlay of $1 and that it was apt to describe the alleged benefit as a ""windfall"". There was also criticism of the trial judge's finding that what lay behind the events that followed was a need to take action, in the applicant's own interest, for tax purposes arising from the ""windfall"". 

254We have earlier set out the detail of the complex factual circumstances surrounding the somewhat elaborate transfer of the shares to the overseas entities. We have also set out the earlier circumstances that showed that the appellant, through Clairmont Holdings, had first acquired the substantial debt owed by Admerex for $1. Approximately $2.2 million of this debt had been assigned to Barat Advisory at no real cost to either Barat Advisory or the appellant. This portion of the debt was later satisfied by Admerex's issue of approximately 55 million shares to Barat Advisory at a value of 4 cents per share. 

255The jury's verdict indicated that it must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Barat Advisory had retained the beneficial ownership of the Admerex shares. This remained the position as at the time of the share swap on 23 February 2005. There appears to be no dispute that at the time of the disposal the 48 million Admerex shares were valued at in excess of 8 million. 

256Against this background, it was plainly open to the trial judge to find, as he did, that the term ""windfall"" was appropriate. It is not easy to ascribe a more appropriate description to the benefit which Barat Advisory (and the appellant) obtained from the initial acquisition of the Admerex debt in 2004 by Clairmont for $1. 

257Mr Robberds argued that the independent experts' report had suggested that the shares had a ""negative value"" as at 31 December 2003. This raised a query about whether the shares had any real value, whereas by contrast, they were being issued on the basis that they were worth 4 cents. The Crown responded by suggesting that an examination of the underlying facts mentioned in the report demonstrated that the company was on the ""up and up"" and that the negative value, although genuinely identified, did not take into account the more optimistic factors likely to affect the share value. In any event, we consider that it was open to his Honour to reach the conclusion he did. He was also entitled to make the associated finding that this benefit was the motivating factor behind the appellant shortly afterwards seeking tax related assistance from Ms Harley. The timing of these two events was obviously significant. We consider that this ground has not been made out. 

Ground 3 (Sentence Appeal) 

258This ground attacks his Honour's finding that the offence in the first count was committed between about 30 April 2004 and September 2005, an extended period of time. It also attacks his Honour's associated finding that the money laundering offence involved ""a series of steps"" taken by the appellant over a period of months, involving intentional wrongdoing on his part. 

259This ground is redolent of conviction ground 1(a). Mr Robberds argued that the money laundering charge related to one event only, namely the 3 February 2005 share swap. It could not relate to any other period. This submission, however, ignores the principal conclusion that must have been reached by the jury (and was reflected in his Honour's findings of fact) that as at 11 June 2004 the appellant, in his capacity as a controlling mind of Barat Advisory and each of the Stichting group companies, intended that the beneficial interest in the Admerex shares would remain with the transferor, notwithstanding the passing of legal title. 

260As we have said, the existence of this intention, and the subsequent actions which demonstrated that the beneficial ownership had been retained, reflected a deliberate spate of activity that was entirely contrary to the formal structure of the Stichting groups which had been so carefully assembled by Ms Harley. In particular, it will be recalled that the appellant was not entitled to any asset of any of the Stichting group until after the proper termination of the Stichting arrangement. Further, at all times the Stichting group companies were required to act independently of the appellant and independently of each other. The events that we have described (and which were central to the Crown case) demonstrated clearly that the Stichting arrangements had been deliberately ignored and the structure flouted. 

261This argument raises a theme that was central to many of Mr Robberds' submissions, namely that the Stichting group structures were not used in the money laundering offence. We do not accept this because of the necessary finding that the appellant at all times intended to ignore the structures set up by Ms Harley and intended throughout, if the opportunity presented itself, to dispose off the Admerex shares and to avoid the payment of capital gains tax. Indeed, in this regard, Mr Robberds' arguments, with respect, were not entirely consistent. As will be seen when the next series of grounds are examined, it was his principal argument on sentence that the appellant's dishonest intentions persisted over a lengthy period of time. For present purposes, however, it may be said that the criminality in relation to count 1 is not to be confined to the share swap itself. His Honour was entitled to examine the events of the preceding 6 or 7 months to assess whether there had been significant criminality throughout the entire period. We consider that he was entitled to come to the conclusion he did. Those events included the issue of the shares to Barat Advisory in April 2004, the appellant's request to Ms Harley for tax advice, and his intentions and actions contrary to that advice which placed him in a position to act opportunistically when the occasion presented itself in February 2005. This ground is not made out. 

Grounds 4 to 5, 7 to 8, and 15 to 19 (Sentence Appeal) 

262These grounds, in a number of respects, reflect the principal matters of concern raised by the appellant on the sentence appeal. They are, it might be said, central to the attack on the length and structure of the sentence, including the non-parole period. 

263The simple issue raised is whether the trial judge erred in finding that the money laundering offence involved significant additional elements of criminality which needed to be reflected on sentence, in addition to the sentence to be imposed for the offence in count 2. In some respects, this argument was the flipside of the pre-trial application which sought to have count 1 on the indictment struck out or stayed as an abuse of process. It will be recalled that his Honour had rejected this application and, in the course of so doing, had reminded himself of the need to examine carefully the circumstances said to underlie the combination of the money laundering and dishonest obtaining charges. The trial judge had been alive to the fact that, in a particular prosecution, it might very well be the case that an abuse of process had been demonstrated by the presence of two counts. At paragraph 82 of this decision, we have set out briefly his Honour's conclusions that brought him to the belief that no abuse of process was involved in the present matter. 

264When his Honour came to the sentencing exercise, he had by that time the full benefit of the evidence adduced in the trial. He was in a much better position than he had been originally. At the earlier time, reliance had to be placed entirely on the Crown case statement. 

265We would respectfully conclude that his Honour's careful and thorough analysis of both the relevant principles and their application to the circumstances of this trial do not demonstrate error in this regard. His Honour set out, in accurate and careful terms, the proper principles in relation to the complex considerations of totality, overlapping criminality and the need to avoid double punishment. There is no suggestion his Honour erred in that respect. His Honour recognised there was, in this matter, a clear overlap between the offences but concluded that count 1 involved significant additional criminality over and above the criminality in the second offence. This was principally based on the appellant's misuse of the offshore structure preferred by Ms Harley. This misuse had two features to it. First, there was the fact that it did provide a measure of masking to the disposal of the Admerex shares and, secondly, because the misuse of the structure enabled the ultimate disposal to take place, a result which simply could not have been achieved had the structure been respected and followed. 

266Mr Robberds' argument was based on a simple foundation. The Crown case, it was submitted, focused on the proposition that, by no later than 11 June 2004, the appellant intended that Barat Advisory would sell the Admerex shares and not include in its relevant tax return any capital gain it might make on the sale. The consequence of this was, according to the argument, that the one single intention underlay the commission of both offences. Given the nature of the offences, the dishonestly obtaining offence should be regarded as the principal offence. The consequence of these arguments, accordingly to Mr Robberds, was that there was no additional significant criminality in the count 1 offence and the sentences should have been structured, both as to their length and concurrency, by reference to the maximum penalty for the offence in count 2. 

267Mr Robberds' arguments, plainly enough, reflected a recognition that the maximum penalty for the money laundering charge was a term of 25 years imprisonment whereas the maximum penalty for the count two offence was imprisonment for 5 years. If the two offences could be curtailed within the penalty for count 2, there would be a significant, forensic and tactical benefit for the appellant. 

268Mr Robberds' argument fails for two reasons. First, as we have pointed out, the trial judge was correct to conclude that the misuse of the Stichting structure and, indeed the reasons in the appellant's mind for its creation, were circumstances of criminality that the trial judge was entitled to take into account. Secondly, Mr Robberds' argument is, with respect, an over-simplification which seeks to proceed without reference to the importance of the facts found by the trial judge. Indeed, Mr Robberds attempted to hive off those facts and argue they were not relevant to the offences. 

269There can be little doubt that, had the appellant simply disposed off the Admerex shares in Australia (without any overseas structure being created), and had at that time without more intended to obtain a benefit by deception, an indictment filed containing the two offences may, in those circumstances, have had little chance of surviving an abuse of process application. Had it done so, however, there can be little doubt that, upon conviction, the criminality of the first charge in such an indictment would most likely have encompassed the criminality within the second. 

270This was not the situation, however, that faced the trial judge when it came to make his assessment of the factual circumstances relevant to the issue of criminality in each offence. As his honour acknowledged, the authorities required him to take ""the commonsense approach to the assessment of criminality with respect to each offence"". It is clear from a reading of his Honour's analysis that, in his view, the evidence revealed, in a significant manner, the areas in which there were discrete aspects of criminality in relation to the commission of each offence. We agree with his Honour's analysis. His Honour was right to conclude that there were significant additional features with respect to the areas of criminality discernible within the facts relating to each of the two charges. There was of course, as we acknowledge, a clear area of overlap but there were also areas of significant additional criminality. The sentences had to reflect, in a principled way, these areas of significant additional criminality as well as recognizing the principles of cumulation, concurrency and totality. In these circumstances, it would have been wrong for his Honour to conclude that all the circumstances which bore upon the appellant's criminal conduct in the period from April 2004 to November 2006 should be placed under the one umbrella of criminality surrounding the second count. The trial judge was right to conclude that such a course ought not be followed. 

271We are unable to discern any error in relation to his Honour's conclusion. 

Ground 9 (Sentence Appeal) 

272The appellant contends that the trial judge did not give sufficient weight to his good character. Mr Robberds' argument was that his Honour gave this consideration less weight than he ought to have done. It is trite law to say that the weight to be given to the issue of good character is a matter for the trial judge: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [111]. However, there can be no doubt that his Honour did take into account in favour of the appellant his good character and favourable antecedents. There can be no criticism of his Honour for noting that good character is of lesser significance on a sentence for white colour crimes than it is for other criminal behaviour: R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7 at [410]; R v Adler [2005] NSWSC 274 at [51]; R v Williams [2005] NSWSC 315; 152 A Crim R 548 at 579 [60-61]. Moreover, his Honour was entitled to make the observation he did that, in a number of respects, the applicant's good character, and his reputation as a successful businessman, assisted to some degree the commission of the offences. His Honour referred (para 219 ROS) to the evidence that Ms Harley had assured several European entities that the appellant was a successful businessman and a person of good character. Those assurances were no doubt required to enable the banking arrangement and the establishment of the Stichting group structure. 

273Mr Robberds raised a muted challenge to the existence of evidence of this kind. However, it may clearly be seen in the written character reference Ms Harley gave to Citco in June 2004 (Exhibit C3.486); it may be seen in the evidence relating to Ms Harley attending at the offices of EFG Bank in Geneva in June 2004 to facilitate the opening of bank accounts by the Stichting group companies (Transcript 182); and it may be seen in Ms Harley's attendance at the offices of Citco in Amsterdam in June 2004 to facilitate the establishment of the structure. 

274Finally, Mr Robberds argued, once again, that the Stichting structure was not used to commit either of the offences. We reject this argument so far as it relates to count 1 and it had, as well as, an indirect bearing on the count 2 offence. 

Ground 6 and 10 to 14 (Sentence Appeal) 

275Grounds 10 to 12 challenge the trial judge's finding that the appellant's course of criminal conduct extended over a significant period of time. Grounds 11 and 13 challenge his Honour's findings in relation to the appellant's planning and deception. Grounds 6, 12 and 14 assert error in his Honour's finding that the appellant's conduct involved the establishment and misuse of a ""sophisticated offshore structure"". 

276The challenges in grounds 10 to 12 have no substance. We have, in our earlier findings, made it clear that these findings were open to the trial judge. In relation to count 1, the jury's verdict required his Honour to find the appellant's criminal conduct commenced no later than June 2004 when, in his capacity as the controlling mind of Barat Advisory and of each of the Stichting group companies, he formed an intention to retain the beneficial interest in the Admerex shares for Barat Advisory. His criminal conduct continued into February 2005 and included those events which plainly demonstrated Barat Advisory's retention of the beneficial ownership through the appellant's control. The conduct then involved the swap of the shares and the consequent sale of the Temenos shares. It extended to the activities which produced the material benefits for the accused including the purchase of property, artworks, jewellery, a yacht and other matters. 

277The appellant's criminal conduct continued into his dealings with the accountants and, over a period of time was particularly focused on his deception of those professional men. It culminated in the lodgement of the Barat Advisory tax return in November 2006. 

278We are also satisfied that his Honour was entitled to find that the Stichting structure represented ""a sophisticated offshore structure"". It could scarcely be described otherwise. An examination of the taxation advice prepared by Ms Harley, and an analysis her memo of fees, demonstrates not only that the advice was essentially tax based but that its implementation was relatively complex. We agree with the Crown that there can be no basis to criticise the description of the Stichting Group arrangement as ""sophisticated"". Nor can there be any quarrel with his Honour's findings that the structure was ""misused"". We have earlier detailed the manner in which the appellant ignored the structure of the arrangements and effectively flouted Ms Harley's advice. 

Grounds 19, 20 and 21, 22 and 23 (Sentence Appeal) 

279The appellant contends that the sentences imposed on each count were manifestly excessive. In support of this contention the appellant submits that: 

(i) Insufficient discount was given for the appellant's facilitation of the course of justice by admissions and other practical steps which assisted in the trial being conducted in an orderly and efficient manner. 

(ii) His Honour did not give sufficient discount for the appellant's prior good character. 

(iii) The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive in comparison with other cases which arose out of the multi-agency tax investigation taskforce known as Project Wickenby. 

(iv) There was no significant aspect of the appellant's criminality concerning count 1 which was not included in his criminality concerning count 2. 

280In general terms, where a ground of appeal is taken that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive, the appellate court will be required to examine the sentence in the light of the two categories of appellable error referred to in House v R (1936) 55 CLR 499. We are concerned here with the second type of appellable error. This occurs where the order under consideration is said to be unreasonable or plainly unjust: House at 505 per Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ. ""It may not appear how the primary judge reached the results embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred."" 

281As Heydon J observed in Hili v R (at 543 [75]), appellate intervention in the second category takes place because the character of the order indicates that some underlying error within the first category has taken place, even though it is not possible to identify it. 

282In the present matter, Mr Robberds, by postulating the particulars he has, relied on errors within the first category whilst assenting overall that an error of the second category has occurred. 

283We would conclude at the outset that none of the particular matters relied on by Mr Robberds has been established. 

284As to the first particular, the trial judge recognised that an allowance should be made for the appellant's facilitatio",2012-03-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2416446,Environment Protection Authority v Truegain Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 41,"Judgment 

1The defendant is the holder of an environment protection licence issued under the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997. The licence is expressed to apply to the premises described as ""Truegain Pty Ltd 62 Kyle Street Rutherford NSW 2320"" for the scheduled activity of ""petroleum and fuel production"" and ""waste processing (non-thermal treatment)"". 

2The defendant has been served with a summons to answer a charge: 

... that, between about 2 June 2010 and about 9 July 20120, at or near Rutherford in the said State, it committed an offence against s 64(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW) in that it was the holder of a licence, a condition of which was contravened by a person. 

3The particulars in the summons describe the licence issued to the defendant and the summons specifies the condition contravened as condition 01.1, which is then set out (in particular (b)): 

01.1 Licensed activities must be carried out in a competent manner. 
This includes: 
(a) the processing, handling, movement and storage of materials and substances used to carry out the activity; and 
(b) the treatment, storage, processing, reprocessing, transport and disposal of waste generated by the activity. 

4The defendant, by an amended Notice of Motion filed on 1 March 2012, now applies for the proceedings to be dismissed, or otherwise stayed, on the basis that the charge is duplicitous. 

5The defendant says that the duplicitous nature of the charge is apparent from the further and better particulars supplied by the prosecutor on 24 February 2012 and 28 February 2012. In its particulars the prosecutor alleges that the defendant committed the offence by way of seventeen separate acts or omissions and at twelve different locations within the premises. The applicant submits that each is a separate offence which is contained in a single charge, and accordingly the charge is bad for duplicity and ought to be dismissed. 

6The offence provision is s 64(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act , which simply states: 

If any condition of a licence is contravened by any person, each holder of the licence is guilty of an offence. 

Maximum penalty: 

(a) in the case of a corporation-$1,000,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, a further penalty of $120,000 for each day the offence continues, or 

(b) in the case of an individual-$250,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, a further penalty of $60,000 for each day the offence continues. 

7The question for determination is whether the offence provision envisages a single criminal enterprise made up of more than one act. That is: is it directed solely at a specific and individual act or omission or at a course of conduct or offence? 

8As noted at [5] above, the defendant contends that the duplicitous nature of the charge is apparent from the further and better particulars supplied by the prosecutor on 21 February 2012 and 28 February 2012. Those further and better particulars identify seventeen acts which, the defendant contends, amount to separate offences which have been alleged under a single charge. The particulars may be summarised as follows: 

(i) the defendant committed the offence by breaching condition 01.1 of the licence (see particular (b) in the summons); 

(ii) the defendant committed the offence by breaching condition 05.1 of the licence (see, e.g., para. 19 (first bullet point) in the second letter); 

(iii) the defendant committed the offence by breaching condition 05.2 of the licence (see, e.g., para. 19 (second bullet point) in the second letter); 

(iv) the defendant committed the offence by breaching condition L1.1 of the licence (see, e.g., para. 19 (third bullet point) in the second letter); 

(v) the defendant committed the offence by failing, itself, to comply with the licence, in breach of s 64 of the Act (see, e.g., para. 14 in the second letter); 

(vi) the defendant committed the offence by failing to ensure that persons associated with the defendant complied with the licence, in breach of s 64 of the Act (see, e.g., para. 24 (first bullet point) in the second letter); 

(vii) the defendant committed the offence by failing to notify the EPA of a tank overflow in breach of the obligations set out in Part 5.7 of the Act (see, e.g., para. 24 (third bullet point) in the second letter); 

(viii) the defendant committed the offence by polluting waters in breach of s 120 of the Act (see, e.g., para. 24 (top of page 9) in the Second Letter); 

(ix) the defendant committed the offence by carrying out the processing of materials and substances incompetently (see, e.g., para. 10 (penultimate bullet point) in the second letter); 

(x) the defendant committed the offence by carrying out the movement of materials and substances incompetently (see, e.g., para. 19 (viii) in the second letter); 

(xi) the defendant committed the offence by storing materials and substances incompetently (see, e.g., para. 25 (xxxvii) in the second letter); 

(xii) the defendant committed the offence by carrying out the treatment of waste incompetently (see, e.g., para. 10 (third-last bullet point) in the second letter); 

(xiii) the defendant committed the offence by storing waste incompetently (see, e.g., para. 19 in the second letter); 

(xiv) the defendant committed the offence by carrying out the processing of waste incompetently (see, e.g., para. 14 (second group of bullet points commencing, 'Failure to maintain DAF') in the second letter); 

(xv) the defendant committed the offence by carrying out the reprocessing of waste incompetently (see, e.g., para. 25 (1i) in the second letter); 

(xvi) the defendant committed the offence by carrying out the disposal of waste incompetently (see, e.g., para. 15 in the second letter); 

(xvii) the defendant committed the offence by failing to properly treat rainwater at the premises (see, e.g., para. 17 (last paragraph) in the second letter). 

9It can immediately been seen that the prosecutor by its particulars alleges breaches of other conditions of the licence and breaches of other provisions of the Act, all of which are said to amount to a commission of the offence. 

10The defendant accepts that the question is whether an offence against s 64(1) of the Act can be of a single event, or an event of a continuing nature as recognised in penalty provision, and whether the particulars disclose a number of discrete offences which infringe the rule against duplicity. 

11The prosecutor submits that on the proper construction of s 64 it is an offence provision that envisages a single criminal enterprise made up of more than one act; it is not directed at specific and individual acts or omissions, but at a course of conduct or series of events over time. 

12The defendant submits that the offence created by s 64 is not a course of conduct offence; but if it is, the allegations in the particulars of various kinds of disparate acts of themselves, if established, amount to separate offences which are said to give rise to duplicity. 

13I have come to the view that the charge in the present case, as amplified by the particulars, is bad for duplicity. As Kirby J noted, however, in Walsh v Tattersall (1996) 188 CLR 77 at 110, such a finding does not oblige the Court to dismiss the charge where the defect is one of patent duplicity. The proper course is to put the complainant to an election to remove the embarrassment. I have come to this view for the following reasons. 

14In Walsh v Tattersall , Kirby J noted (at 110) that a strict approach to resolving questions of duplicity has been consistently applied in the High Court (citing Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467, Iannella v French (1968) 119 CLR 84 and S v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 266), noting that there are reasons of principle or policy which favour the approach. In that case s 120(1) of the Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1986 (SA) read: 

(1) A person who 

(a) obtains by dishonest means any payment or other benefit under this Act 

... 

is guilty of an offence. 

15The Court (Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ dissenting) held that a discrete offence is completed upon the receipt of any one payment or benefit, so that a charge of obtaining by dishonest means ""payment or benefits"" made under the Act and where those such payments were particularised was bad for duplicity. Kirby P noted (at 112) that, as in Johnson v Miller , the appellant had few merits on his side; except legal merits, which are sufficient. 

16So, too, in the present case, the offence is created if ""any condition"" is contravened: s 64(1). As in Walsh v Tattersall the subsection uses the singular. Particularising alleged breaches of other conditions and of other sections of the Act gives rise to duplicity. 

17In Johnson v Miller , Johnson was charged with being the licensee of specified premises out of which person unspecified were seen coming during prohibited hours. In the course of correspondence furnishing particulars, it appeared that the informant Miller alleged and proposed to prove that about thirty men were seen coming in and out of the premises between the prohibited hours and that Miller was in a position to give the exact time when each man was seen, but could prove the identity of only four of them. Later Miller withdrew the letter giving particulars as to the thirty men and substituted for it a statement that an unknown person was seen coming out of the premises during the prohibited hours on the date stated. At the hearing the complaint was amended to refer to ""a certain person"" instead of ""certain persons"". Johnson then contended that Miller should supply further particulars to show which of the thirty men was the man whose emergence from the hotel was the subject of the complaint. Miller refused to do so, and the complaint was dismissed on the ground that it was defective in substance and Johnson was prejudiced by the defect. The High Court (Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ, Latham CJ dissenting) held that the complaint was rightly dismissed. 

18In the course of his judgment Dixon J said (at 487): 

Prima facie, but one offence can be proved under one charge. For, except to prove intent or system and to exclude accident or mistake, evidence that accused persons committed other like offences is seldom relevant to the issue of guilt. But, if the present case fell within the prima-facie rule, plainly to admit evidence of thirty distinct offences would be contrary to law, and the fact that each satisfied the description contained in the complaint could afford no justification for such a breach of so important a rule. 

19Dixon J continued (at 489): 

For, in many cases, evidence of more than one offence cannot be admitted, and under one charge to take evidence of a number of separate instances of the commission of the same offence because each will indifferently fit the complaint is to pursue a course contrary to law. It cannot be enough to require the complainant to elect among the instances he has proved after his evidence has been given in full. Where an information or complaint is so drawn as to disclose more than one offence and one set of facts amounts to each of the various offences covered by the charge, as was the case in Johnson v Needham [1909] 1 KB 626, the proper course is to put the complainant to his election. 

20Johnson v Miller was expressly followed by the Full Court in Byrne v Baker [1964] VR 443. In that case a charge was laid under s 107 of the Companies Act 1958, which relevantly stated: 

(1) A director shall at all times act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office. 

The defendant, a director of the company, was charged that between 3 May 1960 and 21 June 1962 he ""did not at all times use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office"". In response to a request for particulars to enable the preparation of a defence, a ten-page document containing 61 paragraphs was furnished which specified a number of acts or omissions in which it was alleged that the director had not acted honestly or used reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties of office. I observe that this is not dissimilar to what has occurred in the present case. The Full Court held that the charge as particularised was bad for duplicity. In so holding the Court observed (at 153) that the information charged the defendant with a single offence, but each of the particulars if proved would constitute an offence. This placed the defendant in the position of having to defend himself, upon one information, against 25 other charges, proof of any one of which would establish guilt of the first. The whole proceeding was gravely oppressive. 

21In Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd [1988] VR 411, section 21(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 stated: 

(1) An employer shall provide and maintain so far as is practicable for employees a working environment that is safe and without risks to health. 

An information based on s 21 charged a defendant that: 

... being an employer it did fail to provide and maintain so far as was practicable for employees a working environment that was safe and without risk to health. 

The information contained particulars of a number of separate acts and omissions in which it was alleged that the defendant had failed to provide and maintain so far as is practicable for employees a working environment that was safe and without risk to health. 

22It should be noted that s 21(1) is in similar terms to s 64(1) in the present case, and the particulars contained a number of alleged acts and omissions, as in this case. Fullager J held that the information as particularised was bad for duplicity because it contained more than one offence. In so deciding, Fullager J applied Byrne v Baker . His Honour said (at 415) that the language of s 21(1) is apt to convey the concept of the tort of negligence in the field of employer and employee, and that each and every act or omission particularised constituted an offence under the section. 

23In Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill (1995) 37 NSWLR 150, the Full Court of the Industrial Court of NSW considered an information under s 15 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983, which alleged that the appellant: 

... being an employer at Port Botany Liquids Terminal, Port Botany ... did fail to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all its employees, contrary to the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983, section 15. 

That section relevantly states: 

15(1) Every employer shall ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all of his employees. 

24Subsection 15(2) stated: 

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), an employer contravenes that subsection if he fails - ... 

and thereafter the subsection lists a number of specific activities and steps to be done or taken. 

25Particulars were later furnished which identified a number of respects in which it was alleged that the appellant failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare of its employees. The appellant contended that, having regard to the particulars later furnished, the information was bad for duplicity. 

26Fisher CJ did not consider that there was such ambiguity, uncertainty or duplicity as to render that (and two other informations) invalid. Hill J, however (at 128) expressly followed the reasoning of the Full Supreme Court of Victoria in Byrne v Baker and of Fullager J in Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd. Hill J noted that the particulars alleging contravention of s 15(1) consisted of a number of separate and distinct failures, each one of which was a contravention of the subsection. Hill J then continued (at 179): 

In my view, these alleged failures involve at least two alleged contraventions of s 15(1) and therefore two offences. The nature and content of each failure is separate and distinct. The fact that each failure may occur and/or become evident on the same day, in my opinion, is not to the point. Each one is a contravention of s 15. The letter of 28 June 1993 states that the respondent alleges and relies upon various failures falling within all paragraphs of s 15(2). If, of course, the same act or omission falls coincidentally within more than one of the categories of failure set out in s 15(2) (or more than one of the subcategories set out in each category), then, in my opinion, only one offence will be involved. But that is not the case here. Many of the acts and/or omissions identified as failures are disparate in nature and content. They involve different items of plant, different systems of work, different operations and procedures, different locations on the premises, and the safety of ingress to and/or egress from the premises, which in turn could involve, and is seemingly alleged to do so, different risks of danger to different employees. The defence, if any, under s 53 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act may well be very different in respect of each alleged failure. 

The gist of the offence created by s 15 is not, in my opinion, the single act or omission of failing to observe a general duty to maintain at all times a safe working environment for employees which may possess one or more of a number of characteristics or features, but each particular act or omission which amounts to a failure to maintain that environment. Each act or omission which constitutes a failure specified in s 15(2) or otherwise amounts to a breach of the duty under s 15(1) is, in my opinion, a separate offence under the section. I respectfully agree with the reasoning and conclusion of Fullagar J in Chugg and Stanley P in Broken Hill Associated Smelters Pty Ltd v Stevenson (at 137-140). The legislation in this case is, in all material respects, in the same terms as the Victorian legislation; and the relevant and material facts in this case are also similar. 

27I observe at this point that the legislation in the present case is in material respects similar to the Victorian legislation considered in Chugg and the legislation considered in Boral Gas above. 

28Hungerford J also held (at 209) that whilst the information itself exhibited no patent duplicity, the particulars gave rise to latent duplicity or uncertainty - the information was, therefore, bad and contrary to law. In so holding, Hungerford J cited Ex parte Graham: Re Dowling [1969] 1 NSWR 231. In that case the defendant was charged with negligent driving - one offence. The particulars provided, and later evidence showed, that the facts alleged as constituting the negligence occurred at two different parts of the highway. The Court of Appeal held that two separate offences were contained in the information, the conviction was, therefore, bad and the defect could not be remedied. Jacobs JA said (at 236 - 237): 

Between the two acts, the crossing of the centre line and later the overtaking on the bridge, there was an interval of time and space in which the vehicle driven by the present applicant was not observed by any witness and concerning which there is no evidence by way of inference or otherwise that any negligence shown by crossing the unbroken line continued in substance until the act of overtaking the articulated vehicle on the Paddy's River Bridge ... 

However, if the charge or complaint is taken on its face value alone then it is bad, whether it be uncertain because the adjudication thereon extended beyond the charge or complaint or because it was based on a charge or complaint which included two separate acts and was therefore bad for its latent duplicity. 

29Asprey JA (Wallace P concurring) said (at 242 - 243) that on its face the information was sufficient in law. His Honour continued: 

But difficulties arise where the nature of the charge, in the absence of particulars, is such that, to support it, evidence is led to prove conduct which comprises a continuity of action or a series of connected acts. In cases of this type, where the evidence adduced passes beyond proof of conduct of the kind so described and calls upon a defendant to answer two or more separate offences upon the single information, a conviction upon the offence charged in the information is bad. ... The question then arises as to whether these occurrences constituted one offence of negligent driving or whether they constituted two or more separate offences. This raises problems of some nicety. The answer to this question would appear to be whether the occurrences alleged in the evidence, although happening at different places on the Hume Highway and at successive times, constituted one continuing offence. ... The test would sometimes be whether the acts in question are so separate and complete in themselves that each constitutes an offence. ... But that is not a universal touchstone as in each case the conduct of the defendant must be considered in relation to the nature of the offence with which he is charged. ... In the present case I would regard the alleged conduct of the applicant when he crossed the separate unbroken lines on the hill on the southern side of the bridge and the continuation of his driving in that position to a point where he caused the police vehicle to turn sharply to avoid a collision as a single, continuous incident of negligent driving. But, in my view, another situation arises in relation to the alleged overtaking of the articulated vehicle on the bridge some one half to three quarters of a mile further along the Highway because for a considerable distance before that position had been reached, the applicant had driven his motor vehicle back to the correct side of the road and had followed the articulated vehicle for the distance in question on to the bridge in a manner of driving to which no exception was taken before he commenced the act of overtaking it. In other words, one alleged act of negligent driving had been completed and followed by a distinct course of exemplary conduct before the alleged occurrence of conduct of quite a different character. ... Whether what took place amounted to duplicity strictly so called or whether the alleged facts disclosed a latent ambiguity or uncertainty in the information matters not. Upon this charge only one offence could be proved and the admission of evidence of more than one offence was contrary to law ... 

30Hungerford J found (at 205) that the position in Boral Gas was analogous to the quoted position in Ex parte Graham; Re Dowling where there was found to be two disparate acts of negligent driving so as to constitute two separate breaches of that one offence. Hungerford J (at 207 - 209) then referred to and followed the two Victorian cases of Byrne v Baker and Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd , in which he said that the issue arose directly for consideration. 

31As a consequence of the decision in Boral Gas , a new section was inserted into the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 (s 49A) - now s 31 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000, which is in the following terms: 

(1) More than one contravention of a provision of Division 1 by a person that arise out of the same factual circumstances may be charged as a single offence or as separate offences. 

32Thus, in John Holland Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of NSW [2010] NSWCA 338, Spigelman CJ (Beazley and Giles JJA concurring) said: 

65 The fact that the Application for Order expresses a range of matters in terms of a single offence does not, in the specific context under consideration, raise the kind of issues of duplicity which often arise in a criminal prosecution. That is by reason of s 31 of the OH&S Act , which I have set out at [15] above. 

66 Section 31 was originally enacted as s 49A of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983, in response to the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission in Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill (1995) 37 NSWLR 150. 

33At [71] Spigelman CJ said: 

Section 31(1) is facultative and permits a course which common law principles of duplicity would not permit. 

34Mr J Horowitz, appearing for the defendant, submits that each of these cases strongly supports his submission that the charge in the present summons, amplified by the particulars, is bad for duplicity. 

35I accept, of course, that ultimately what is presented is a question of fact and degree in each case (as noted by Kirby J in Walsh v Tattersall at 108). There are also cases, such as those relied upon by the prosecutor in this case, which go the other way. 

36Notwithstanding the submissions of the prosecutor and the authorities upon which it relies (as discussed below), I am persuaded by each of the above-mentioned cases - which are almost directly relevant to the present case - to conclude that the charge in the present case, as amplified by the particulars, is bad for patent duplicity. Moreover, the absence of a provision of such as s 31(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 reinforces this view. The wide-ranging particulars in the present case, raising as they do alleged breaches of other conditions of the licence and other statutory provisions contravenes the common law principles of duplicity which the High Court had reaffirmed in Walsh v Tattersall , noted above. 

37I accept, however, that there is a contextual indication in s 64 itself that the offence is one which can encompass a course of conduct. That is, it is legitimate to charge in a single count one offence although involving more than one act, in which case a charge may not be bad for duplicity: R v Locchi (1991) 22 NSWLR 309. This appears to be so when one looks at the penalty provisions for an offence against s 64, which provides for both a single penalty and a further penalty ""in the case of a continuing offence"". 

38In Ex parte Graham; Re Dowling the two offences occurred at successive times and at different placed on the Hume Highway. Between the two acts there was an interval of time and space when there was no evidence by inference or otherwise of any negligence. One act of negligence had been completed, followed by exemplary conduct, before the second act of negligence and at a different location. These two facts led to the conclusion that they were two separate and distinct offences. 

39In the present case the particularised conduct all occurred within the licensed premises, albeit in different parts of those premises. The licence applies to the premises described as ""Truegain Pty Ltd, 62 Kyle Street Rutherford NSW 2320, Lot 29 DP221102"". Unlike the case of Ex parte Graham: Re Dowling , each of the particularised conducts occurred at the same location, namely, the licensed premises. The real question is whether the particularised conduct - which may be of a continuing nature - describes a series of discrete or separate offences, accepting, however, that a single offence may be of a continuing nature. 

40Some of the authorities relied upon by the prosecutor relate to a single course of conduct of a continuing nature. For example, in CSR Ltd v Environment Protection Authority [2000] NSWCCA 373; (2000) 110 LGERA 134, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that a summons was not bad for duplicity which alleged that the defendant negligently caused a substance to leak in a manner which harmed or was likely to harm the environment: there was but one continuing offence which possessed one or two forbidden characteristics - the single act remained unlawful whether it harmed the environment or was likely to harm the environment. That is, there was only one offence which was charged, relevantly to cause a substance to leak for a continuous period. 

41In Montgomery v Stewart (1967) 116 CLR 220, the High Court held (by majority) that an information charging a defendant with an offence under s 43 of the Companies Act 1958 (Vic) of issuing of a prospectus containing more than one untrue statement did not create separate offences. The offence involved a single course of conduct - issuing a prospectus - which did not involve, as does the present case, conduct which is alleged to infringe other prohibitions. 

42Similarly, in Hamzy v R (1994) 74 A Crim R 341 the appellant was convicted of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin, based upon evidence that he had supplied a number of witnesses with various amounts of heroin at different times during the twenty-month period specified in the indictment. In holding that there was no duplicity, the Court of Criminal Appeal followed Locchi (inter alia) and held that the Crown is entitled to plead in the one event a charge of supply where it intends to prove a number of individual acts or supply to different people at different times, provided that those acts can fairly and properly be identified as part of the same criminal enterprise or the one criminal activity. Hunt CJ at CL explained the principle as follows (at 343 - 344): 

Prima facie, only one offence may be proved under each count of an indictment: Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 487. An indictment is bad for duplicity where it is apparent on its face that more than one offence has been charged in the one count. That is a true duplicity, but that is not the complaint here. The appellant's principal argument here is that there is a latent ambiguity in each count, in the sense described by Dixon J in Johnson v Miller (at 486), in that it is not until the evidence is led in support of the charge that it becomes apparent that the count is referring to more than one offence. It is argued by the appellant that the evidence in the present case discloses a large number of individual supply offences, although none by itself involving a quantity of heroin of not less than 250 g. 

Both true duplicity and latent duplicity may embarrass an accused, although that is not always the case. So far as true duplicity is concerned, he may wish to plead guilty to one of the offences disclosed and not guilty to the other or others. So far as both types of duplicity are concerned, he cannot at the conclusion of the Crown case submit that there is no case to answer in relation to some but not all of the offences claimed by the crown to have been established. 

43In R v Moussad [1999] NSWCCA 337 the appellant was convicted of defrauding the Commonwealth by obtaining money by way of Child Care Fee Relief to which she was not entitled. The charge was laid under s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which states: 

A person who defrauds the Commonwealth ... is guilty of an indictable offence. 

The Crown contended that as part of a continuing offence the appellant submitted nine false quarterly claim forms between 1991 and 1993. After reviewing a large number of cases, each of which turned on their own facts, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the charge was not bad for duplicity. 

44In Environment Protection Authority v Sydney Water Corporation Ltd (1997) 98 LGERA 361 the defendant was charged with a contravention of a condition of a licence issued by the prosecutor under the then Pollution Control Act 1970. The condition of the licence which was said to have been contravened stated: 

Pollution control equipment, fuel burning equipment or industrial plant installed in or on the premises must be maintained in an efficient condition and operated in a proper and efficient manner. 

The EPA, before the commencement of the hearing, provided particulars of the alleged breach of the condition, specifying the respects in which Sydney Water had failed to maintain the industrial plant in an efficient condition. Those particulars were provided on the basis that the sewage treatment plant was regarded ""as a single entity wherein the free flow of liquids is interrupted by individual items of plant"". There were five items said not to have been maintained in an efficient condition. The Court of Criminal Appeal dealt with an issue in the case which is not presently relevant. However, the Court noted that in a preliminary ruling, which was not challenged on the appeal, Talbot J at first instance had held that it was appropriate for the prosecution to be conducted upon the basis that only a single offence was being alleged and rejected a submission that the alleged failure in respect of each of the items must be regarded as a separate offence. Although not an issue in the Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ (Ireland and Bruce JJ concurring) said (at 363): 

Charging a single offence in such circumstances is consistent with authority and practice in criminal cases: see, eg, Director of Public Prosecutions v Merriman [1973] AC 584 ; R v Hamzy (1994) 74 A Crim R 34l. 

45The finding of no duplicity in Sydney Water appears to be inconsistent with the findings of duplicity in Byrne v Baker , in Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd and in Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill. In Sydney Water it appears that the sewage treatment plant was regarded as a single entity wherein the free flow of liquid was interrupted by individual components of the plant, whereas in the present case the particulars relate to different activities involving different items of plant or equipment and different operations and procedures. The cases are hard to reconcile. I think that some guidance is offered in Montgomery v Stewart , which is authority for the proposition that a single offence can be constituted by more than one individual act or omission, provided that the acts or omissions are of the one kind so as to constitute the one criminal activity. Thus, in both Hamzy and Moussad the acts of the defendants in each case were all of an identical kind - in the case of Hamzy it was the various acts of supplying heroin, and in the case of Moussad it was the various acts of obtaining money to which the defendant was not entitled. 

46In the present case the particulars clearly disclose actual or patent duplicity in alleging acts or omissions which are said to involve contraventions of conditions of the licence other than condition 01.1. This conclusion follows from the wording of s 64(1): ""If any condition of a licence is contravened ..."". The section uses the singular - ""condition"". I derive support for this conclusion in Walsh v Tattersall. In that case the offence provision provided that a person who obtains by dishonest means ""any payment or other benefit under this Act ... is guilty of an offence"". As Gaudron and Gummow JJ pointed out (at 89), in that case: 

... there is no offence created of '[obtaining] by dishonest means payments or benefits under [the Act]'. Yet count 1 was so expressed. 

47In applying the reasoning in Walsh v Tattersall to the present case, it inevitably follows that the charge as amplified by the particulars which allege contravention of conditions additional to condition 01.1 demonstrate actual duplicity. 

48For the same reason it is self-evident that the allegations of acts or omissions which are said to arise from contraventions of other statutory provisions are also duplicitous since they each amount to separate or discrete offences. The duplicity arises, at the very least, in particulars (ii) - (iv) and (vii) - (viii) noted at [8] above. 

49I have come to the view that the remaining particulars, with the possible exception of particulars (v) and (vi), are also bad for duplicity. In coming to this view I have relied upon Johnson v Miller, Byrne v Baker, Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd, Boral Gas (NSW) Pt Ltd v Magill and the observation of Spigelman CJ in John Holland Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of NSW (noted at [32] and [33] above) . As Dixon J said in Johnson v Miller: "" Prima facie, but one offence can be proved under one charge"" and ""to admit evidence of thirty distinct offences would be contrary to law"". In the present case, as in Byrne v Baker, as in Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd and as in Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill the summons charges the defendant with a single offence but each of the particulars if proved would constitute an offence. Thus, as in Boral Gas, the particulars allege a number of separate and distinct failures each of which would be a contravention in itself. If, however, the same act or omission were alleged then only one offence would be involved, but that is not the case here. To adopt Hill J in Boral Gas (at 179): 

Many of the acts and/or omissions identified as failures are disparate in nature and content. They involve different items of plant, different systems of work, different operations and procedures. ... The defence, if any, under s 53 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act may well be very different in respect of each alleged failure. 

50I also have come to this view in the light of the statutory defence which is available to a prosecution under s 64. Subsection 64(2) states: 

(2) Defence 

The holder of a licence is not guilty of an offence against this section if the holder establishes that: 

(a) the contravention of the condition was caused by another person, and 

(b) that other person was not associated with the holder at the time the condition was contravened, and 

(c) the holder took all reasonable steps to prevent the contravention of the condition. 

A person is associated with the holder for the purposes of paragraph (b) (but without limiting any other circumstances of association) if the person is an employee, agent, licensee, contractor or sub-contractor of the holder. 

51The defence is available if ""the contravention of the condition"" was caused by another person. The defence, if any, may well be different in respect of each failure. The defence would thus be available to any or each of the acts or omissions which have been particularised if each were regarded as a discrete offence, but would otherwise not be available if each particular was regarded as part of the one offence against the section unless they were all caused by another person. 

52It may also be the case that particulars (i), (v) and (vi), although not demonstrating actual or patent duplicity, may involve latent duplicity depending on what evidence is sought to be led, particularly if the matters do not relate to the ""licensed activities"", namely ""petroleum and fuel production' and ""waste processing (non-thermal treatment)"". Moreover, particular (xvii), noted at [8] above, appears to have nothing to do with the licensed activities but may amount to a breach of some other provision, in which case it, too, is duplicitous. The difficulty with any latent duplicity is that it is often not possible for a Court to determine whether there is latent duplicity until the evidence is led. 

53I hold that the summons, as amplified by the particulars, is duplicitous. The particulars supplied make clear that more than one offence is alleged. However, this does not render the process incurably bad. The prosecutor can, at this preliminary stage, remedy the situation by electing, prior to trial, which of the matters alleged in the particulars it proposes to pursue.

2416484,R v AD [2012] NSWDC 273,"Sentence


1HIS HONOUR: AD appears today for sentence in relation to five matters on an indictment, to which he pleaded guilty in July 2011, in the District Court at Coffs Harbour before another judge and also appears in relation to proceedings concerning an alleged breach of a s 12 bond, granted to him in respect of a wounding offence. 

2The five matters on the indictment to which he pleaded guilty were, respectively, in relation to count one, an allegation on 23 March 2010, at Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales, the prisoner did possess child pornography material, namely five photographic images for use through a carriage service. The second count alleged that on 22 March 2010 at Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales, he did use a carriage service to transmit child pornography material. The third count alleged that between 1 January and 23 March 2010, at Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales, he did commit an act of indecency upon AM, a person under the age of sixteen year's, namely thirteen years. The fourth count in the indictment was in identical terms to the third, and the fifth count in the indictment alleged that between 1 January and 23 March 2010 at Coffs Harbour in the State of New South Wales, the accused did incite AM, a child then under the age of sixteen year's, namely thirteen year's to perform an act of indecency knowing that the act of indecency was being filmed, for the purposes of producing child abuse material. Count one carries a maximum penalty of fifteen year's imprisonment, as does count two I am informed. Count three and count four both carry maximum penalties of two year's imprisonment and count five carries a maximum penalty of ten year's imprisonment. The offences alleged in relation to count one and two are breaches of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act. The other three offences are breaches of State law. 

3The reckless wounding matter is an offence committed on 8 February 2009 at Coffs Harbour, when the accused stabbed a gentleman by the name of Richard Kirk. In relation to that particular matter the accused was convicted and sentenced to twelve month's imprisonment, suspended pursuant to s 12 Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act on 12 October 2009. The offences with which I am concerned, committed up until 23 March 2010, involve clear breaches of the good behaviour bond, granted the previous year and inevitably, as was conceded by counsel for the prisoner, required the revocation of the good behaviour bond and the imposition of a sentence of twelve month's imprisonment. S 98(3) Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 could demand nothing else.

4In relation to the facts, upon which the prisoner is to be sentenced for the matters on the indictment, there is an agreed statement of facts that was tendered when I sat in Coffs Harbour in December 2011. I should point out as was implicit in what I said earlier, the prisoner pleaded guilty at earlier sittings of the District Court before another judge. The matter came on before me in December. Application was made to adjourn the matter because a report had not been prepared but I indicated to the parties that the length of time that the matter had taken to get to where it was, demanded that I should at least commence the matter and complete it when I was in a position to be satisfied, that such reports that were being sought, were needed. As it transpired I was satisfied in the circumstances, that there needed to be a further delay for further reports to be prepared and I must say I was greatly assisted by both reports, prepared and tendered by both the defence and the prosecution. 

5The prisoner was arrested on 23 March 2010, in the Coffs Harbour area, and was found in possession of a knife and a small quantity of cannabis leaf. This arrest was unremarkable except for the fact that when police took custody of the prisoner's mobile phone, and did a search of the phone in an endeavour to find the personal details of the prisoner who suffers an intellectual disability, to which I will refer in a moment. The police found five separate photographs of a naked boy. The photographs according to the record on the phone, were taken between 19 March 2010 and 21 March 2010. These five images constitute count one. 

6A further search of the phone revealed that the prisoner had sent to a man who I shall refer to as PS, on 22 March, one of the images. PS told police that he had received a photograph of a naked boy who he knew to be an Aboriginal boy by the name AM. PS has seen the boy a number of times at the home of the prisoner and PS said he was shocked receiving the photograph, having not solicited that photograph. That constituted count two.

7On 24 March police searched the prisoner's home, they found further cannabis leaf. The evidence reveals the prisoner is a regular user of cannabis and enquiries revealed that the boy shown on the data bank of the prisoner's phone was a young man, AM, born on 20 December 1996 and thus was thirteen year's of age when the photographs were taken. He was not interviewed until 20 May 2010. He said he knew the prisoner and would go to the prisoner's home to be provided with cannabis. The child gave details of sexual offences committed upon him. He said that on one particular occasion, the prisoner had told him to ""get stoned"" and expose his genitals. When this was done the prisoner told AM to pull his buttock cheeks apart and he took a photograph of AM in this position. AM said the photograph was taken with a white mobile phone, which is not the phone which the police recovered from the prisoner. AM told the police that he in fact had ""smashed"" the prisoner's white phone. That event gives rise to count three. 

8On another occasion the prisoner forced the boy to masturbate. When he ejaculated the prisoner put the ejaculate on a spoon and placed the spoon in his own mouth. That is the detail relevant to count four in summary. In relation to a particular photograph the victim said the prisoner had supplied him with cannabis and got him stoned. He had told AM to pull his pants down and pose naked with his legs spread apart. The prisoner forced A to do this by holding a knife towards him. The prisoner photographed A in this position. During the interview AM signed the photographs that were marked by interviewing police and those images were numbered and that allegation relating to the actions of the prisoner and the taking of the photograph constitute count five. The knife with which the victim was threatened was identified by the victim, from photographs supplied by the police. 

9The prisoner has been in custody since his arrest on 23 March 2010, and the effective sentences to be imposed upon the prisoner date from that date. Although, as I will explain, there will need to be some partial accumulation of some of the sentences. The prisoner when he committed these offences was forty-six year's of age. He was born on 2 July 1963 and on my calculation will turn fortynine this coming July. He has prior findings of guilt. He has a conviction at the Coffs Harbour District Court in January 1986 for two counts of indecent assault, for which he was placed on what was called a recognisance then, to be of good behaviour for three years. He was charged in relation to those matters on 24 July 1984.

10On 29 May 1986, that is subsequently as I understand it, he was charged with committing an act of gross indecency upon a person under the age of eighteen years, and at the Sydney District Court on 15 December 1987 he was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment with a nonparole period of nine months.

11On 23 August 2011 he was sentenced at the Coffs Harbour District Court in relation to two offences of committing an act of indecency on a person under the age of ten years. On one count he was sentenced to two years imprisonment, suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, by entering in a good behaviour bond to receive supervision from the Probation and Parole Service. On the second count he was placed on a s 9 good behaviour bond for a period of four years.

12On 12 October 2009 at the Coffs Harbour Local Court, as I said, he was convicted of recklessly wounding another person and sentenced to a term of imprisonment, which I have outlined, which was suspended. He was also convicted of possessing a prohibited drug for which he was fined $150. For the offences for which he was initially charged on his arrest on 23 March concerning the custody of the knife and the possession of the cannabis, of which there were two counts, he was fined in each respect $200, although at that time he, of course, was in custody.

13In relation to the indecent assault matter for which the prisoner received a three year good behaviour bond, the psychologist's report prepared for sentencing purposes made a reference to the victim as ""the nine year son of a local publican."" In relation to matters with which the prisoner was charged in mid 1986 and sentenced to a term of imprisonment the psychological report prepared for the court referred to the victim being a thirteen year old male. In relation to the convictions in 2011, for which the prisoner received, amongst other things, a suspended sentence, the psychological report prepared on that occasion for the prisoner's appearance at court referred to the victim being a five year old son of a friend. I have no other details and I again repeat what I have said many times that it is high time that judges in the District Court and the Supreme Court when sentencing an offender in relation to indictable matters were given the remarks on sentence in relation to prior indictable matters if they are available and in the modern era with digital recording of judgments that is not an impossible task one would have thought. It is vital that sentencing judges have all available information in relation to relevant prior convictions, and clearly the matter to which I have referred are highly relevant.

14In sentencing the offender, of course, I have taken into account the limited Victim Impact Statement prepared by AM, who reflected upon the effect upon him of the prisoner's offending, his anger, his fear and the guilt that he felt arising out of the actions of the prisoner.

15It is true, as the facts reveal, the prisoner did not abduct the victim and drag him kicking and screaming to his own home. But it is also true, as I will outline in a moment, the prisoner has a great deal of difficulty taking responsibility for his wrongdoing and his exploitation of his victims, not just this one, but the other victims to which I referred. The Corrective Services psychological report actually quotes the prisoner's remarks in respect of those other offences and, as with this matter, the prisoner's response is very much one of minimising the impact of his conduct upon others. In respect of one previous victim he simply said ""one thing led to another I know I (as said) shouldn't have happened."" In relation to another victim he said it was ""the same shit, apparently I touched him."" The prisoner's insight in relation to the current matters is, of course, limited indeed.

16Although the prisoner did not give evidence before me I have a great deal of history in the respective psychological reports and in the Probation and Parole Service report.

17I will come back to the personal circumstances of the prisoner in a moment, but by reference to the Probation and Parole Service report dealing with the material tendered in the Crown case, the prisoner is noted to be in breach of the bond previously given. The report outlines the background of the prisoner, including having been diagnosed at the age of twelve months with congenital hydrocephalus or ""fluid or water on the brain"" and having been treated for that for a period of time. The prisoner is physically disabled in a very noticeable and material way. He presently walks with a walking frame and clearly is greatly limited in his physical capacities.

18So far as the Probation and Parole Service report is concerned, dealing with matters within the purview of that service and its supervision of the prisoner in the past the Probation and Parole Service notes a history of social isolation. It also notes the fact that the prisoner minimises his behaviour, tends to blame others for the circumstances in which he has found himself in and ""appears to have little understanding of his offending behaviour.""

19The report reflects upon his physical and intellectual disabilities, detailed by the psychologist and notes that his previous supervision has had limited impact upon him. It notes details from previous psychological reports. In June 2000 it was noted that the prisoner was

""socially awkward and has a lesser than adequate understanding of the consequences of his own actions. He is unaware of others' perception of him. He is not orientated towards group activity. He is less competent than normal of expressing himself and initiating actions with others. He has problems with inappropriate anger, impatience, irritability and impulsivity."" 

20It noted his history of cannabis use, although he does not consume alcohol.

21So far as his attitude towards the offences are concerned the prisoner told the Probation and Parole Service that he denied using the knife, but that issue is not challenged for these proceedings. He told the Probation and Parole officer that he was ""stoned"" at the time of these offences and ""did not know what he was doing."" He said to the Probation and Parole officer that the victim ""would often come around"" to his place stoned and ""make a pest of himself."" He acknowledged to the Probation and Parole officer that he should not have committed the offence and that it was ""the wrong thing to do"", but, as I said earlier, minimised his responsibility, particularly given the victim's age. The Probation and Parole Service noted that the offender was a person who needed a high level of intervention by the Service, particularly requiring referral to the Department's sex offender programs.

22It is clear, obviously, without reflecting upon his unsuitability for Community Service and the like that the prisoner is a person who must be sentenced to terms of imprisonment in relation to the current offences, notwithstanding the terms of s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

23This brings me to the reports of the psychologist. The two reports are very detailed and thorough and very much accord with one another. One can act with some confidence upon them, given the many common observations and findings relating to the prisoner. Taking the material from the reports concerning the prisoner's background because it is more detailed than that contained in the Probation and Parole Service report, I note the prisoner is the third eldest of eight children. He claims seven brothers that he says are aged in their ""late twenties to late fifties"". His father died in 1997 and his mother died in 1999 and it would seem that he was not the subject of any violence, sexual or otherwise from his parents or within his family and he did not witness any domestic abuse. He indicated, however, great difficulties in his education because of the effects upon him of his hydroencephalitis and the fact that effectively he was unable to read or write and was never offered remedial education or assistance at school and thus has had very limited real education. He has received a disability support pension for his physical disability his entire adult life. His physical disability includes what is described, as I understand the reports, as muscular dystrophy that has existed for a long period of time. His strength in his leg muscles and the rest of his body has diminished throughout his life, however whilst in custody there has been no significant deterioration. 

24There is no suggestion in the material available to me, nor any claim made by AD, that he is unable to receive adequate medical treatment whilst in custody but I do accept by reason of both his physical disability and his intellectual disability that the circumstances of custody are circumstances of greater hardship for him than for persons of average intellectual and physical disposition serving their sentences in the general gaol community. He has not suffered any head injuries in his life but his intellectual disabilities have of course remained with him throughout his life. He has two children from a relationship that he entered into when he was twenty seven years of age. Those two children are now aged, as I understand it, fourteen or fifteen but are in foster care, the mother being unable to care for them. The prisoner has indicated an interest in their welfare and the fact that they communicate with him whilst he is in custody. 

25His sexual proclivities have generally been homosexual, although he had a relationship of a sexual character with the mother of his children. I do not propose to go into the detail of his sexual background. It is not a matter of great significance. It does not necessarily explain the offending behaviour, but it is clear that he has a history of offending in relation to underage boys and thus might be said to have a proven capacity to commit offences of a paedophilic or hebephilic character. The prisoner denied any paedophilic or hebephilic interests despite the nature of the current offences and only admitted to watching age appropriate pornography without an interest in paedophilic pornography. I have no reason to conclude that what he said in that regard was untrue. The psychological assessments of the prisoner by both the psychologists retained by the defence, Ms Nasr and the psychologist from the Corrective Services Department, Kate Solomon generally agree. There is more detail than Ms Nasr's testing in Ms Solomon's testing however does reflect upon testing that has been conducted in the past.

26According to the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale(WAIS), AD's verbal intelligence was assessed as being in the borderline range superior to only five per cent of his aged peers. His non verbal or performance intelligence was also determined to be in the Borderline range of the eighth percentile. Overall AD's intellectual functioning was estimated to fall in the borderline range with his performance being above five per cent of the normative sample. It was said this was consistent with his presentation reported history. It is noted that impoverished verbal skills are often associated with a greater tendency to impulsivity and poorly reasoned behaviours through a lack of self reflective skills or limited insight. Impoverished non verbal skills are often associated with poor visual motor coordination and abstract reasoning and limited general intelligence.

27The Corrective Services psychologist's report notes that reports in 1985 variously describe the prisoner as ""mild to moderately disabled physically and mentally"" with below average reading and other capacities. One report in 1987 assessed AD at being in ""the bottom five to ten per cent of the population"". Another report in 2000 described in as having ""a borderline intellectual disability"". A 2010 report apparently recorded, or made when the prisoner was in the current custody described him as having ""mild range of intellectual disability"". The overwhelming evidence is that his intellectual disability is much greater than that. As I said, to be fairly described as ""borderline"". 

28His hydrocephalous has affected him in a range of ways. It has left him as an isolated individual most of his life, both as a child and as an adult. He has poor self esteem and low confidence and generally, except on limited occasions, sticks to himself. The psychologist retained by the defence opined that his offending was best understood within the context of a ""poorly socialised man with disturbed attachment and intimacy deficits and poorly reasoned thinking and decision making with limited understanding or forethought to the consequences of his behaviour."" The prisoner was reported to have limited or minimised, not just his offending behaviour but his problems and deficiencies. It was thought that he had symptoms or presentations consistent with a Schizoid Personality Disorder, having regard to DSMIVTR criteria. 

29The major issue, apart from issues of intellectual ability and the like addressed by both reports concerns the assessment of the prisoner's risk to others, particularly in the area of further sexual offending. I should hasten to say that having regard to the facts of the case, having regard to the intellectual and physical circumstances and social circumstances of the prisoner and particularly noting the character of his prior offending, it would be self evident on those matters alone that the prisoner was a person of some considerable risk of re-offending in the future. 

30Both psychologists undertook a risk assessment by reference to the use of actuarial measures. The specific actuarial measure undertaken by the Department of Corrective Services, as is usually the case in such reports, was the use of what is described as the Static 99R instrument to assist in the prediction of sexual recidivism. The two psychologists both agree that the prisoner on these actuarial assessments is a person in the ""high risk category"" relevant to other male sexual offenders. 

31Without going into a detailed analysis of both reports, given their similar conclusions, perhaps it is most convenient to summarise the dynamic risk factors which are considered relevant. Matters that are predictive against AD's risk of further offending are that he does not present as inherently psychopathic, he denies being a victim of sexual abuse and he does not present with ""serious mental health concern"" in relation to his offending behaviour. However, factors that can be considered to elevate AD's future risk of re-offending are his history of sexual offences and use of coercion in the past, the use of coercion to take pornographic pictures of the victim, the history of sexual and non sexual offending in indicating some sexual deviancy, antisocial aspects of his lifestyle, severe and endemic psychosocial deficits, limited self awareness, lack of employment, regular drug use, poor coping and problem-solving abilities, lacking future oriented goals et cetera.

32I have taken these matters from the defence's psychological report. It is a matter of commonsense, but also of expert evaluation, that the preponderance of risks work in favour of an elevation of his risk, rather than a diminution of his risk to others. Static and historical risk factors identified in that report, including the fact that the prisoner has never lived with a partner for more two years, has prior non-sexual violence history, has four former sexual offences, has four or more prior sentencing appearances, the victim was unrelated to him, the victim was a male suggest this is so. The instrument used by the defence psychologist suggests that the ""normative sample"" on which this instrument is based suggests that thirtynine per cent of offenders would receive a further sexual conviction within five years, and fortyfive per cent within ten years, and there are other statistics presented. 

33I am mindful Ms Nasr points out, as does the Correctional Services psychologist, that these statistical or actuarial instruments have their limitations, and they both point to the fact that their predictive capacities have to be seen in the context of the many qualifications which are set out in the report. The Corrective Services report deals with dynamic and static risk, or stable risk factors, and the report covers the same issues. Both reports indicate that, given the findings of the respective psychologist, the prisoner is one who needs treatment intervention. The prisoner has reported that he is willing to participate in a sex offender treatment programme and there such programmes available in custody, and there are such programmes available in the wider community. 

34There is a suggestion within the Corrective Services Report that the treatment programme in custody would need a ""minimum period of two years"" post sentencing. I agree with the submission put by the accused's counsel that I cannot fashion a sentence to accommodate the ability of the prisoner to undertake that particular programme. What I must do is sentence the prisoner appropriately and according to law, and fix an appropriate sentence, taking into account all relevant matters, just not that particular factor. 

35I note the Corrective Services report, which is also authored by the Therapeutic Manager of Sexual Offender Programmes for the Corrective Services, states that there are sex offender programmes in the community for risk management and treatment, although the programmes are not designed for ""high intensity needs sex offenders"". It is felt by that report that his needs would not be adequately met in the community. Be that as it may, as I said, the determination of the appropriate sentence must take into account a wide range of factors, not just those matters. 

36Clearly, by reference to the findings of both reports, the prisoner is a person who needs an extended period of supervision to assist in relation to adjustment to community living such as finding appropriate accommodation, and requires an extended period of supervision to address, not just matters relating to his risk to others in the community, but also his abuse of cannabis and related issues, including his social isolation. I have not forgotten the fact that, although the prisoner is a person at risk of reoffending, it would appear that his inhibitions may well have been reduced significantly, or substantially, by his use of cannabis. In any event, I have had close regard to both psychological reports, and the time available to me now does not enable me to do complete justice to the detail of those reports.

37As I said, there was no other evidence apart from the psychological report. The prisoner did not give evidence, but I fully understand his capacities are so limited he would no doubt not do justice to himself, and I do not hold that against him. No other material was presented in substance on his behalf.

38Both the Crown and the defence provided helpful written submissions, and I have taken into account the detail of those submissions in the conclusions that I have reached. The oral submissions that supplemented the written submissions by definition, given the detail in the written submissions, were limited. Essentially, in conjunction with the writing submissions, it was submitted that the prisoner's intellectual disability means that his moral culpability is diminished, he is not an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence. It was also submitted that he should receive a discount greater than ten per cent, notwithstanding the fact that he pleaded guilty on a date that the matter was fixed for trial, or perhaps the day after, the reason being that, because of his intellectual disability, it was much more difficult to obtain proper instructions from him short of, of course, he being unfit to be tried. It was also submitted, as I said, that the sentence should not be adjusted simply to accommodate the need for him to undertake courses recommended by the Department of Corrective Services. 

39In relation to the Crown's oral submissions, supplementing the detailed written submissions, the Crown drew the Court's attention to the finding of the Corrective Services psychologist in respect of the intellectual disability and its relationship to the offending that:

""AD's intellectual disability...does not appear to be a key contributing factor in his sexual offending behaviour. It may, however, affect his ability to engage in abstract thinking and have insight into his behaviour. Furthermore, AD's intellectual disability is relevant with regard to treatment, and is considered as a responsivity factor in the recommendations below"". 

40This case brings into very sharp focus the decisions of superior courts in relation to the treatment of offender's with intellectual disabilities. I bear in mind, of course, as I turn to this topic, that the discussion with which the Court is concerned in the cases is very much related to the purposes of sentencing now set out in s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. All of those purposes, one way or another to varying degrees, have a relevance in this particular sentencing exercise. However, particularly in the context of punishment and personal deterrence and general deterrence and their relevance to sentencing on this occasion, one has to consider the principles that I have summarised in the judgment of R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228. Ironically, Ms Hemsley, after this judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal came back for sentence before me in 2006 for an almost identical offence for which she was sentenced by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2004, and I was required to apply Hemsley principles to Ms Hemsley. In summary, Sperling J said at paragraphs thirty three to thirty six that mental illness and, in that regard, I also refer to mental disability - may be relevant in three ways. 

41First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. There may not then be the same call for denunciation, and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced. Secondly, mental illness or disability may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration. Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person. 

42I interpose to point out in this matter and I have already accepted such is the situation here because the prisoner, not only has his mental disabilities, he also has his very substantial physical disabilities. Fourthly, and a countervailing consideration that is to be taken into account, is that the level of danger which the offender presents to the community may sound in special deterrence, and his Honour, in those succinct remarks, referred to a number of authorities. 

43I should also note one of the authorities cited by Sperling J, the decision of the learned Gleeson CJ when he was Chief Justice of the New South Wales Supreme Court in R v James Peter Engert, a decision with which the balance of the Court agreed, where his Honour discussed the authorities, commencing in New South Wales with the decision of Grove J in Scognamiglio in 1991, dealing with the diminution of a consideration of general deterrence when the prisoner was not an appropriate vehicle for that message. His Honour, the learned Chief Justice, after referring to the late Justice Badgery Parker's judgment in Letteri, an unreported judgment from 1992, said that:

""The question of the relationship, if any, between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence goes to the circumstances of the individual case, to be taken into account in the application of relevant principles. The existence of such a causal relation in a particular case does not automatically produce a result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence anymore than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case. For example the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offences or offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence and increase the importance of a particular deterrence or the need to protect the public. By the same token there may be a case in which there is an absence of connection between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence for which the person is being sentenced with the mental disorder may be very important in considerations of rehabilitation or the need for treatment outside the prison system.""

44In this matter the facts of the case reveal that the prisoner's intellectual disability is a matter that has clearly contributed at least in part to his social isolation which has contributed to the circumstances in which he came in contact with the victim and the circumstances in which the prisoner abuses cannabis. These were preludes to the commission of the offences. His intellectual disability provides for him difficulties also in abstract thinking. It may make him even more susceptible to the effects of cannabis, although he has been a cannabis user for some period of time and the effects would not be foreign to him. Of course cannabis could contribute to the lowering of his sexual inhibitions, whether he had an intellectual disability or not. Certainly his social isolation and his cannabis use in that isolation provided the opportunity for him to have contact with the victim in circumstances where others were unaware that it was occurring. 

45The evidence reveals, however, in his criminal history that he is a man who has offended against children before and certainly could not be seen in the context of his criminal history that the offences with which I am concerned were either opportunistic or uncharacteristic. The relationship between his intellectual disability and the offending is not clearly drawn. Certainly in my view of the objective facts, whilst his intellectual disability may have some salience in explaining the circumstances of the commission of counts three and four, the causal connection and the explanation for his offending by reason of his intellectual disability has far less weight or salience in explaining or understanding the circumstances of the commission of the offences in counts 1, 2 and 5. 

46The facts of the matter are that the taking of photographs and the storage of them, the dissemination of them on a limited basis reflect the technical expertise and a degree of deliberation beyond simply impulsive conduct. Even if this technical expertise and conduct was not inconsistent with borderline intellectual function they certainly reflect in their terms these events, a capacity for deliberation and/or cunning which would allow for these offences to occur. The organisation and execution of the offences set out in counts one, two and five reflect a recognition by the prisoner of the consequences of what he was doing, particularly given that one of the images was transmitted to another for that other person's supposed digestion and/or gratification. It should also be pointed out that the threats the prisoner made in order to commit the offence in count five show a determination on the part of the prisoner to commit the substantive offence beyond what could simply be described as a lack of inhibition, or a lowering of inhibition by reason of intellectual disability or cannabis usage. 

47So far as his borderline intellectual capacity or disablement not making him an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence or lowering his moral culpability, the relationship between his condition and the commission of the offences as I say may be stronger in relation to counts three and four but less so in counts one, two and five. However, even accepting a causal connection between his intellectual disability and the commission of all the offences or by reference to the so called Hemsley principles that I have referred to, if I was to accept that he was not an appropriate vehicle for the message of general deterrence to be given its full weight, given what Gleeson CJ said in Engert, noting the previous crimes against children, noting the psychologists' opinion based upon the criteria to which they refer and the actuarial test that they have applied, and having regard to simple common sense that the prisoner is a person at high risk of reoffending, personal or specific deterrence in this matter require some greater weight than might otherwise be the case. 

48This is underlined in my view, as reflected in the respective psychological reports, by the prisoner failing to take full responsibility for his misconduct and seeking to shift the blame to some degree. I am prepared to accept of course this aspect of the prisoner's presentation may be very much a manifestation of his intellectual disability as it has been described. Thus I simply state that in sentencing the offender I have taken into account the principles to be applied and carefully weighed the competing purposes of sentencing that arise in this particular matter. 

49In relation to the objective circumstances of the offending certainly whilst the offences set out in counts three and four maybe consistent with impulsive behaviour, as I said earlier they are not uncharacteristic offences for the prisoner and the offences set out in one, two and five have little or no impulsive character and reflect upon the capacity of the prisoner to understand the seriousness of his conduct and the capacity of the prisoner to deliberate upon that conduct. Ultimately, I have concluded that the offence set out in count five with its maximum penalty of ten years has at least the character of offending in the mid range of objective seriousness. I hasten to say I am not using the language of Part 4 Division 1A. Counts one and two in their character and execution are at the lower end of the range of seriousness, given the various matters discussed in R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370 and R v Minehan [2010] NSWCCA 140. But, also, it must be fairly said that counts one and two have to be seen in a wider context, particularly of related indecent assaults in the sense of offences of that character committed during this same period of time or perhaps beforehand.

50The criminal history of the prisoner does not entitle him to any particular leniency and I have dealt with that as it evidences his risk to others. As I have pointed out the consideration of s 3A for the purposes of sentencing requires a fine balance in the way in which I have analysed it from the cases that I have referred to including Hemsley and Engert. In relation to each offence the offender is to be sentenced to an appropriate sentence for each offence with appropriate consideration given to the totality of the criminality by accumulation or concurrency as the case maybe as set out in the majority judgment of Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610.

51Briefly by reference to s 21A of the Act, noting of course, the general application of the common law of sentencing under s 21A(1), the facts are that the prisoner was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the commission of all the offences and this is clearly the most significant aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2) of the Act.

52I appreciate that his intellectual disability may limit his complete understanding of the consequence of his conduct or limit his capacity to think through the fact that these offences were committed whilst on conditional liberty. In relation to the counts three, four and five the intoxication of the victim by providing him with cannabis, even if the victim demanded the cannabis, is an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(c)(b) of the Act. Of course, again this matter is to be seen in the context, not only of the intellectual disability of the prisoner, but his own dependence and use of cannabis. 

53In relation to count five the commission of that offence is one that involves aggravations, which I have referred to in the facts as they have been revealed to the court. The offence carries a maximum penalty of ten years and pleads the filming for the purposes of producing child abuse material as a relevant ""aggravation"" the use of force in these circumstances, as revealed in the facts, points to a particular aggravation under s 21A(2)(c) of the Act.

54In relation to mitigating factors arising under s 21A(3) of the Act the most significant matters that I can identify are the fact that the offences were not part of ""planned or organised criminal activity"". The prisoner's pleas of guilty are a mitigating factor, although he receives a discreet discount for that. I note from the submissions of the defence, which I accept, that there was no physical injury or cruelty inflicted upon the victim in relation to any of the offences, but particularly in relation to count 1. The poses taken by the prisoner on his mobile phone did not depict ""explicit sexual activity."" The prisoner did not retain photographs for profit or disseminate them for profit, but rather for personal purposes. Although he did send one image to a third party, again, this was not for a commercial purpose. 

55In relation to the fixing of the appropriate nonparole period I have pointed to special circumstances that arise. Another special circumstance that is relevant is the fact that the sentences I impose will involve some accumulation upon other sentences. The structure of the sentences that I have fixed upon reflects upon the fact that I view counts five and one as the most serious of the offences in the context of the statutory maximums. I am mindful of the fact that the Commonwealth offences carry greater maximum penalties, but in the scale of objective seriousness they are at the lower end of the scale, whereas the offence under count five is a State offence at a higher range of objective seriousness, but with a lesser maximum penalty. 

56I am constrained in relation to counts three and four by the maximum penalties which are in each case two years. In relation to count two, although it has the same maximum penalty as count one it is, in my view, for obvious or various reasons less serious than the objective seriousness of count one carrying the same maximum penalty.

57In relation to the discount to be provided for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty, in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton, which has application, initially I was drawn to the view that it was a discount of ten per cent. But I am now satisfied, fully apprised of the prisoner's intellectual disability and the difficulties pointed to by Mr Carty that the discount should be slightly more than ten per cent, although the prisoner pleaded guilty when the matter was to commence as a trial. There are obviously difficulties in dealing with a man of this man's significant incapacities and I have concluded that the appropriate discount should be one of twelve and half percent to reflect the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. I do note in that regard as far as I am aware the victim has never been required to attend to actually give evidence. I note also that he was left in a state of uncertainty until the last moment. It was submitted in any event by Mr Carty that the appropriate range was between ten and fifteen percent and in that regard the Crown accepts there must be discount for the utilitarian value for the pleas of guilty.

58I do not believe there is a need in practical terms to refer to any other matter that has been raised in submissions, as I said all matters have been taken into account. Thus the sentences I impose are as follows: 

59In respect of the alleged breach of s 12 bond, having regard to the terms of s 98(3) of the Act, and noting the breaches admitted, that bond is revoked. This prisoner is convicted. He is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twelve months to commence on 23 March 2010 to expire on 22 March 2011.

60In respect of counts three and four this is the offences of indecent assault, the prisoner is sentenced to one year, five months, two weeks imprisonment on each count. The starting point of those sentences is twenty months imprisonment. The final sentence includes the Thomson and Houlton discount. Those sentences are to be concurrent with one another and each to commence on 23 September 2010 to expire, as I calculate, on 6 March 2012. 

61In respect of count two the sentence imposed upon the prisoner is a non parole period of two years commencing on 23 March 2011 and expiring on 22 March 2013, the balance of sentence is seven months and two weeks. My calculation is the balance of sentence will expire on 6 November 2013. There is no finding as to special circumstances in relation to that sentence, because of the sentences of non parole periods to be fixed for counts one and five which will be concurrent with that sentence.

62In respect of counts one and five the prisoner is convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of three years, to commence on 23 March 2011 expiring on 22 March 2013. I have made a finding of special circumstances. The balance of sentence shall be one year, eleven months and seven days. The starting point of that sentence was four years and six months, the total sentence for those two counts, bearing in mind the sentences to be served concurrently is three years, eleven months and seven days. The starting point for the sentence I impose in relation to count two was three years imprisonment, less twelve and a half percent discount. 

63Thus the total sentence imposed is one of four years, eleven months and seven days. The effective nonparole period is three years imprisonment. The effective commencement to the sentences will be 23 March 2010. The effective expiry date of the nonparole period will be 22 March 2013 and the balance of the sentence, effectively, will be, as I said, one year, eleven months and seven days. I cannot direct the offender be released to parole. That will be a matter for the Parole Authority.

		28 March 2013",2012-03-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2416507,Sullivan v R [2012] NSWCCA 41,"Judgment 

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Blanch J. 

2BLANCH J: The applicant seeks an extension of time within which to appeal against his conviction for murder and for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed. The grounds of appeal are: 

(1)The trial miscarried as a result of a failure to direct on intoxication. 

(2)The trial miscarried as a result of a failure to insufficiently direct on reckless indifference. 

(3)The verdict was unreasonable. 

3The trial occurred between 24 June and 7 July 2009 and a verdict of guilty of murder was returned by the jury on a charge that on 3 October 2007 at The Entrance in the State of New South Wales the applicant did murder Adam Guy Prochilo. 

4On 9 July 2010 he was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment comprised of a non-parole period of 18 years and 9 months and a balance of term of 6 years and 3 months to date from 7 October 2007. 

The facts 

5The applicant and the deceased were known to each other. The applicant sold drugs to the deceased which were sometimes paid for in money and sometimes in the form of goods. Prior to 3 October 2007, the date of the alleged offence, there had been animosity between the applicant and the deceased. Mr Gould, a neighbour of the applicant, gave evidence that the applicant said to him that his wallet had gone missing and he knew who it was, that he had had a shower and when he came back his wallet was missing. He said the applicant said it was about drugs and that the name of the person was Adam. He said the applicant was agitated and angry and said ""... he was going to stab him next time he came around."" 

6The deceased, Adam Prochilo, visited the applicant at his home at The Entrance shortly after 1.11 a.m. on the morning of 3 October 2007. There was evidence the deceased was in need of money to fund pending legal proceedings. There were three guests asleep in the lounge room of the applicant when the deceased arrived. They gave varying accounts of what they saw and heard but they did see the applicant holding a knife with blood dripping from the blade and he co-opted them into cleaning up the blood and disposing of the knife. In respect of two of these witnesses, the judge gave a warning about the unreliability of their evidence under s165 of the Evidence Act because of their chronic alcoholism. A neighbour, Mr Bradshaw, heard someone in the applicant's house say ""Sorry mate, sorry mate I didn't mean it"" and then that man hurried off into the street. The deceased left the applicant's property and he was heard by another neighbour at his front door calling for help and saying that he had been stabbed in the chest. He died before he could receive any medical attention. 

7The applicant's evidence was that the deceased came to the house to get drugs on credit. He refused him and there was an altercation in which the applicant punched the deceased and the deceased fled. Some short time after, the deceased came ""flying through the door"" and attacked him causing him to fall from his chair and slide across the kitchen floor. In his evidence the applicant said he was repeatedly hit about the upper body by the deceased and believing he was going to be seriously injured, he reached up for the knife and swung it around blindly in the direction of the deceased, thus causing the fatal stab wound. 

8Arising from these facts the Crown case at trial was that the applicant was guilty of murder pursuant to s18A Crimes Act on the basis that the act causing death was done with reckless indifference to human life or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. 

The grounds of appeal 

9The first ground of appeal is the trial miscarried as a result of a failure to direct on intoxication. 

10The applicant gave evidence at trial that during the day and evening prior to the arrival of the deceased he had smoked three or four cones of cannabis which he shared with two of his guests, Mr Thompson and Ms Walker. He said that prior to the arrival of the deceased the last occasion he had used cannabis was at about 9.00 p.m. or about three hours prior to the arrival of the deceased. He was asked in chief how he was feeling so far as the marijuana was concerned and the following passage of evidence occurred: 
Q. Just before Mr Prochilo came, how were you feeling so far as the marijuana was concerned? 
A. Just cruising, just out of it, whacked, you know. 

Q. Sorry? 
A. Just out of it, you know, whacked. 

Q. Out of it, whacked. What do you mean by that? 
A. Yeah, just a bit whacked, just cruising well. Stoned. 

Q. Stoned and what do you mean by that? 
A. Out of it. Just out of it, stoned. Out of it mate, stoned, cruising. 

Q. You also say that you'd taken some amphetamine during the day? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. So how many times before Mr Prochilo came the first time had you taken amphetamine on that day or night? 
A. How many times have I taken it that night and day? About three times, four times that day. 

Q. So by the time Mr Prochilo came the first time to see you, how many times had you taken marijuana? 
A. About three. 

Q. How many times had you taken amphetamines? 
A. About three. 

11He also gave evidence that on the afternoon of 2 October 2007 he had taken half a gram of amphetamine on three or four occasions and he had a further half a gram of amphetamine in the five to ten minutes between the time the deceased left his residence and later returned attacking him. His account was that on the night the deceased was killed he had come, then left and then returned. The applicant said the total amount of amphetamine of about one gram had an effect on him. He was asked in cross-examination to describe it and he said ""It sort of - it picks you up. It picks you up. Like, if you play sport it picks you up. You know what I mean? It'll fix your - it'll - your reflexes speed up, more energy."" He went on to say ""I was just - just cruising, just cruised. It just made me cruise."" 

12In the course of the closing address by the Crown Prosecutor, the trial judge asked the defence whether any directions were sought relating to the taking of amphetamine and defence counsel indicated the defence would seek to rely on the use of cannabis and amphetamine in relation to the subjective element of self-defence. At page 1076 of the appeal book her Honour referred to the fact there was no pharmacological evidence about the effect of marijuana and she was concerned the jury were being asked to speculate. At page 1088 her Honour said: 
""The mere fact that he had a cone of marijuana three hours before the deceased came around to his house leaves, in my thinking, no likelihood or any real possibility that your client was intoxicated at the time of the stabbing."" 

13She repeated at page 1092: 
""And simply because there is nothing upon which the jury in my view could form a reasonable view that at the time of the stabbing he was intoxicated by the marijuana. He might have been affected by it."" 

14Her Honour indicated at page 1102 that: 
""... my provisional all but settled view Mr Jeffreys is that I won't leave it on the 428 basis but will, as I say, make reference to it in the other context."" 

15Her Honour was there referring to the context of the defence of self-defence. At the end of the summing up counsel for the applicant raised the issue again and said ""... I take it your Honour's not - going to leave it"" and her Honour said ""No"". 

16The other evidence as to this issue came from one of the applicant's guests Mr Thompson who said he had consumed three bottles of beer but the applicant had no alcohol. He said that he and the applicant had shared three or four cones of cannabis during the day prior to the arrival of the deceased. He was one of the witnesses in respect of whom a warning about unreliability was given. 

17Ms Walker, another guest, said the applicant had not consumed alcohol or cannabis but she had been drinking alcohol and smoked two cones of cannabis. She claimed not to have had any continuing effects. She was also a witness about whom the unreliability warning was given. 

18Ms Turnbull, another guest, said she observed the applicant, Mr Thompson and Ms Walker all using cannabis during the afternoon. 

19During the course of the summing up at paragraph 194 on page 99 of the appeal book her Honour did refer to the applicant's evidence that he was ""stoned, whacked, he was out of it"". At paragraph 223 at page 108 of the appeal book her Honour said: 
""You might, if you reach the point of giving consideration to self-defence in this case, take into account that the accused on his own evidence was affected by cannabis when he struck out in the way that he describes, which he told you made him feel ""whacked"" and you might also take into account that, on his evidence, he had just had some amphetamine, and you might consider in those circumstances whether the drugs or either of them might have affected his perception of the threat and also his perception of what was necessary for him to do to defend himself in the situation in which he found himself."" 

20So far as the trial itself was concerned the approach taken by the defence was to advance the proposition that the applicant was acting in self-defence because he believed it was necessary for him to use the knife to defend himself and that in making a judgment about the accused's belief it was necessary to take into account he was affected by drugs. It would have been tactically difficult for the defence to mount an alternative argument before a jury that the accused did not foresee the probability of death or serious injury because of the effect of the drugs. 

21The question raised is whether, in view of the evidence given, the trial judge should have directed the jury that because of that evidence they should acquit the accused of murder and find him guilty of manslaughter, if the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the accused did foresee the probability of death or serious injury because of the evidence of intoxication by drugs. 

The law 

22In Regina v Stones [1956] State Reports 25 the Court of Criminal Appeal substituted a verdict of manslaughter in circumstances where there was considerable evidence about the intoxicated state of the appellant. The Court there held that when analysing the mental element of murder: 
""The important thing is not the desire of consequence, i.e. motive or intent, but merely foresight of consequence which is the common factor to intention and recklessness."" 

and on that basis intoxication was a relevant factor to be considered in relation to a charge of murder, even where it was alleged the accused acted with reckless indifference to human life. 

23Now in New South Wales by virtue of s428C(1) Crimes Act intoxication may be taken into account in determining whether the person had the specific intent if one is required. By virtue of s428B(1) murder is included as a crime of specific intent. 

24In Viro v The Queen (1976-1978) 141 CLR 88 at page 112 Gibbs J as he then was said: 
""In a case where there is evidence fit to be considered by a jury that the accused was intoxicated as a result of the consumption of drink or drugs, it is not enough to tell the jury that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had in fact formed the requisite special intent. They should also be told that the fact that the accused was intoxicated, whether by drink or drugs or by a combination of both, may be regarded for the purpose of ascertaining whether the special intent in fact existed."" 

25The issue was considered in the case of R v Andres Galambos (1980) 2 A Crim R 388. In that case in an unsworn statement the appellant claimed he had been drinking for a considerable time prior to the offence. He did not expressly allege he was intoxicated at the time of the offence and his counsel did not seek to raise the issue and the trial judge gave no directions about intoxication. In the judgment of Hunt J, with whose judgment Samuels JA agreed, at page 395 said: 
""The question for this Court is whether the material so relied upon by the appellant provides a sufficient foundation for a direction that the onus lay on the Crown to remove any doubt that material may raise ... "" 

26His Honour pointed out that ""The material relied on by the appellant is certainly very brief."" He said it was possible to interpret what the appellant said as indicating he had been drinking alcohol all the previous evening and before he confronted his wife with a rifle in the morning he had consumed a number of double scotches within a short period. It was noted there at page 397 that although the trial judge had asked counsel for the applicant at the trial whether he sought a direction in relation to intoxication that it would have been very difficult in front of the jury tactically for defence counsel to ask for such a direction in circumstances where his defence was he had not intended to fire the rifle and his Honour referred to the decision of the High Court in Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107 at page 117: 
""Whatever course counsel may see fit to take, no doubt bona fide but for tactical reasons in what he considers the best interest of his client, the trial judge must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law. This involves, in my opinion, an adequate direction both as to the law and the possible use of the relevant facts upon any matter upon which the jury could in the circumstances of the case upon the material before them find or base a verdict in whole or in part."" 

The Court allowed the appeal and substituted a verdict of manslaughter. 

27In Bellchambers v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 235 this Court emphasised that the test where intoxication was a relevant issue was not whether the accused had the capacity to form the intent but whether he had in fact formed the intent. In R v White, Evans and Parker (1988) 17 NSWLR 195 this Court stressed that in a case of murder by reckless indifference to human life the accused must foresee the probability of death. This decision was endorsed by the High Court in Royall v The Queen (1990) 172 CLR 378 at 395. 

28The question for consideration is whether the evidence of the applicant that he was ""out of it"" and ""whacked"" by the drugs he had taken should have been left for the jury to consider on the basis that it was relevant in determining if the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt the applicant had the requisite intent namely foresight of the probability of death or grievous bodily harm. 

29In R v Shaw (1981) 2 NSWLR 648 the Court was dealing with a conviction for murder where the deceased had been killed by seven blows from a tomahawk while in bed. His flatmate was convicted although he said he came home late at night and he found the deceased already dead. In his record of interview when asked about his state of intoxication he said ""I would say half whacked, three quarters whacked. I knew what I was doing."" An off duty police officer who saw him in the street that night said ""I could tell he had had something to drink but he was well aware of his senses."" In an unsworn statement at his trial the applicant said ""I was quite drunk at the time, three quarters drunk."" 

30A challenge was mounted to the conviction on the basis that the judge had withdrawn the question of intoxication from the jury. In the course of giving his judgment Street CJ said at page 651: 

""The scope open to a trial judge to evaluate whether there is evidence fit to be considered by a jury necessitates an evaluation of the evidentiary material before the jury at the conclusion of the trial. As Barwick CJ pointed out in R v O'Connor (1980) 54 ALJR 349, at p 358; 29 ALR 44, at p 466: 

""If the evidence, if accepted, is not such as to be capable of raising a doubt as to either of the basic elements, voluntariness or actual intent, there being no other material to suggest a lack of voluntariness or actual intent, that evidence can be withdrawn from the jury's consideration."" 

Such exiguous evidence as was before the jury in the present case, if it could be described as evidence of intoxication, was in my view far too insubstantial to justify any weight being placed upon it, bearing in mind, I repeat, the context of the course of the trial and the course of evidence."" 

31His Honour was there referring to the seven blows with a tomahawk that might indicate an intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. 

32Similarly in the case of R v Murray and R v Manton (1980) 2 NSWLR 526 this Court by majority rejected an appeal based on the failure of a trial judge to direct the jury on the possible effect of intoxication on intent in a case where the appellant said he was ""really pissed"" but denied raping the victim. No direction was sought at the trial. Special leave to appeal to the High Court against this decision was refused. 

33The Crown argues the issue of intoxication should not have been left to the jury and points to the absence of any mention of his intoxication in the record of interview, the absence of cross-examination of witnesses on the issue and the failure to mention it in the opening by the defence and indeed the failure to mention it until the end of the trial. On the other hand the main defence advanced by the applicant was that of self-defence which involved his belief he was being attacked and his response was necessary to defend himself and that his conduct was a reasonable response in the circumstances as the applicant perceived them. A submission that the applicant might not have foreseen the probability of at least serious injury would not sit well with a jury for tactical reasons. That, however, does not relieve the Crown of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt and in a proper case it does not relieve the Crown of dealing with the issue of intoxication even if not raised by an accused - see Pemble (supra) and Galambos (supra). 

34In this case it is understandable there was no cross-examination of the three witnesses who were guests as to the state of intoxication of the applicant. To suggest he was so intoxicated he might not have the relevant intent would tend to contradict the defence being raised that he was acting in self-defence. The result, however, is that no evidence of intoxication exists save the evidence of the applicant at trial. That evidence must be evaluated against his other evidence relating to self-defence. That other evidence involved a detailed account of an altercation with the deceased on what the applicant said was his first visit to the house and that involved him punching the deceased and chasing him off. He then gave detailed evidence of going back into the house, turning on the jug and setting about cutting up cones of cannabis while sitting on a chair. He said the jug boiled and he mixed up a ""few lines"" of ""goey"" or ""speed"". He then described the deceased as coming back 15 minutes later and there followed a detailed description of an attack on him which led him to believe it was necessary to use a knife to defend himself. 

35The authorities clearly establish the need to alert the jury to all relevant legal considerations even if they are not relied on by the defence because sometimes there may be tactical reasons to explain the omission by the defence. On the other hand if the evidence is not capable of raising a doubt it is permissible for the judge to decline to put the issue before a jury even when asked by counsel to do so. 

36In this case the only evidence of intoxication was the somewhat imprecise evidence of the applicant that he was ""whacked"" or ""out of it"" or ""cruising"" and his detailed evidence of his actions that night and his recollection of them contradicts any suggestion that his mental state was such as to raise as a reasonable possibility the fact that he did not have the relevant intent. In those circumstances I do not believe the trial judge erred in not placing the issue before the jury. 

37It follows that even if I had been able to conclude there was evidence such as to require it to be placed before a jury, I would also conclude that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred in accordance with the proviso to s6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 because of the weakness of the evidence. 

38The second ground of appeal asserts ""The trial miscarried as a result of a failure to insufficiently direct on reckless indifference."" In support of this ground it is submitted the jury should have been told the Crown had to establish that the accused's knowledge of probability had to be a substantial or real likelihood as distinct from a mere possibility. Crabbe v The Queen (1985) 156 CLR 464 is quoted as authority for this proposition. 

39I do not believe any authority suggests that the knowledge has to be of a substantial likelihood. On the other hand there is ample authority the accused must foresee the probability of death (see for example White supra). In this case the jury was given a written direction defining reckless indifference as ""An Act is done with reckless indifference to human life if the accused foresaw or realised that his act would probably cause the death of the deceased but he continued with that act regardless of the risk of death."" That direction is in accordance with the law and it was repeated in the summing up. There is no error and I would dismiss this ground of appeal. 

40The third ground of appeal asserts the verdict is unreasonable. 

41In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13 at paragraphs 11 to 14 the High Court reaffirmed its decision in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, that where there is a ground of appeal that the verdict is unreasonable: 
""... the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 

42The Court went on to say: 
""13. The starting point in the application of s6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say: 

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred."" 

Save as to the issue whether the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in not viewing a videotape of the complainant's police interview, to which reference will be made later in these reasons, this qualification is not relevant to the present matter. 

14. In determining an appeal pursuant to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act , by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA , the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated: 

""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'."" 


43The starting point for a review of the evidence is that the applicant said that he did stab the deceased and it is clear that stab wound caused the death of the deceased. The version given by the applicant was that the deceased came to get drugs from him but he wanted the drugs on credit. The applicant refused the request and there was an argument during which the applicant thought the deceased was going to hit him so he punched the deceased who then fled. He said he sat down to cut up cones of cannabis and about 15 minutes later the deceased unexpectedly ""came flying through the door"". He said he was attacked by the deceased so that he ended up on the floor. He tried to get up but the deceased attacked him again punching him and kneeing him in the face. He said he ended up facing front on to a cupboard on his knees and the deceased came towards him again with his arm up. He thought the deceased was going to ""flog him"". He said ""I thought I was done 'cause I thought he was going to flog the shit out of me."" He said he then ""just grabbed one of the knives and flung me arm back"". He went and hid but he could not see whether he was bringing the knife. He said the deceased held his chest, said the applicant's name and then went out the door. He also said that after the deceased left his own nose was bleeding and he had to attend to his nose. The issue in the case was thus an assertion of self-defence. 

44Benjamin Gould was a neighbour of the applicant and had known him for some months before September/October 2007. His evidence was that some time before 3 October 2007 that some days earlier the deceased had stolen the applicant's wallet with $600 in it and he was going ""to stab him next time he came around"". He went on to say that after the fatal stabbing the applicant told him that the deceased had come to his residence on the night, came in and tried to stand over him but the applicant said ""Hang on a minute"", went into the room and came back out and stabbed him. He told Gould the deceased was standing with his hands up at about shoulder height with his palms out, when he stabbed him and said to him ""No Sul"". He told Gould he went towards the deceased who fell to the ground, then got up, ran out the door chased by the applicant's dog. He also said the deceased ""burst open like a stuffed pig and bled everywhere"". There was evidence that the deceased was in need of money for court proceedings. 

45Another neighbour Glenn Bradshaw gave evidence that he knew the voice of the applicant. On the night of 2 and 3 October 2007 he awoke and in the early hours of the morning of 3 October he heard muffled voices, a sound of a door open and close and then ""what sounded like someone being winded"". He then heard someone call out ""Sorry mate, I'm sorry mate, I didn't mean it, I'm sorry"". This voice was a panicky voice which he did not recognise. He then heard hurried footsteps away from the applicant's house. 

46The three guests Mr Thompson, Ms Walker and Ms Turnbull also gave evidence although there was a warning to the jury about the unreliability of the evidence of Mr Thompson and Ms Walker. Jeffrey Thompson said he had known the applicant for 20 years and was staying with the applicant for two days prior to 2 October. He acknowledged he had been drinking during the course of the day and was ""a bit pickled"". He said during the night he was woken by knocking on the door. He heard a voice calling out ""No, no Tony no"" and that voice was not the applicant's. He then heard a bang. He then got up and went to the door and the applicant was there with a knife and said to him ""Take this"". He said the applicant had come running in from the stairs of the house. He had first refused to take the knife but the applicant insisted and he took it down to the back fence and put it into the ground. The knife was covered in blood and he took it down to the back fence ""walked around the alley way right and put it down into the ground"". 

47Jane Walker said she had known the applicant for 25 years and the witness Thompson was her partner. She said she went to the house at 5.00 p.m. on 2 October 2007. She said she drank four cans of beer before going there and drank two long necks during the night. She had not intended staying but because of the amount of alcohol she had she decided to stay the night and went to bed at about 10 or 11.00 p.m. She heard a knock at the door at 2 o'clock and a voice call out ""No Tony no"". She said it was ""a scared voice"". She said she and Jeffrey Thompson got up and she saw the applicant in the doorway of the lounge room very agitated. He said ""I think I've killed a man."" He had something in his hands and asked ""Jeff to take it"". He asked him to ""throw it in the lake"". She asked the applicant what happened and he said ""That man ripped me off for mobile phone $400."" She did not see any injuries on the applicant. In cross-examination she said he didn't say anything directly to her but he spoke to ""Jeff"" and she said what he said to ""Jeff"" was ""I think I've killed or I stuck it right through him or something to that effect"". 

48Susan Turnbull met the applicant four days before 2 October 2007. She arrived at his home at 11.00 a.m. on the 2 nd . She said she did not drink and did not use cannabis. She said she was watching television after dark and she heard a thud and someone calling out ""Oh no"". After a short gap she heard the applicant call out to Thompson telling him to come and she then saw the applicant give Thompson a knife that had blood dripping from it. The applicant told Thompson to throw the knife in the lake. Her evidence was the applicant then demanded both Jane Walker and she help him find where the blood was and help him clean it up. She said she did not notice any injuries on the applicant nor did he complain of any injuries. She noticed blood on the applicant's hands and the front of his clothes. She said that when Thompson came back after disposing of the knife he said to the applicant ""Did you get him?"" and then ""Tony said that he did once. He put it - his right hand to his left side of his chest, and Jeff asked Tony did he kill him and Tony said, ""If I'd fucking killed him he would have been lying here wouldn't he?"" And Tony kept on saying, ""We've got to clean this place up."" 

49After the event there was a covert recording of 7 October 2007. In that listening device recording the applicant said "" at least I put him down... I told him to go out there and he [came] up to his ... doorway right... don't forget because he called me an old man and then he called me little fella after that ... I went bang straight into the chest ... He put the bite. He put the bounce put the bounce on him one step and put one get in early..."". 

50The applicant argues that the evidence of Ms Turnbull in cross-examination that she heard a thud, the scraping of furniture and then a voice say ""Oh no"" is consistent with the account of self-defence given by the applicant. It is also argued that the amount of blood in the kitchen indicates that is where the stabbing occurred rather than closer to the front door. 

51It is argued that the finding of the applicant's blood in the kitchen also supports the applicant's claim of self-defence in a struggle. 

52Those submissions do not in my view raise any doubt about the prosecution case. The evidence establishes to me that the applicant admitted the stabbing to the jury. He did not mention self-defence immediately afterwards to any of his guests and what he did say to his guests was not consistent with his actions being in self-defence. His attempts to clear up the blood in his house and the insistence on the disposal of the knife might be consistent with someone who simply panicked but in view of what he said to the three guests it is more likely he was attempting to conceal a crime. The evidence of Mr Gould and the evidence from the covert recording is evidence of a deliberate act done by the applicant which was not in self-defence. When all of the evidence is considered, it clearly proves the act of the applicant was deliberate and that it was not done in self-defence. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the applicant of murder and I am thus satisfied the verdict of the jury was not unreasonable. I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 

The sentence appeal 
Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant had an intention to kill 
53In R v Isaacs (1996-1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at pages 377 to 378 this Court summarised the duties of a trial judge after a jury verdict. They included determining the facts consistent with the jury's verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. In The Queen v Olbrich (1999-2000) 199 CLR 270 the High Court emphasised that a sentencing judge must find beyond reasonable doubt facts adverse to the accused but it is enough to prove facts in favour of the accused on the balance of probabilities. 

54It is necessary to recognise that in a case such as this the sentencing judge was in a good position to determine the facts having observed all of the witnesses, including the applicant, give evidence. In this case it is asserted there are two aspects of the matter which cast doubt on the judge's finding that the act of the applicant was done with intent to kill. The first assertion is that the verdict may have been based on an act of the applicant done in self-defence which was not reasonable. The second is that the act of the applicant was impulsive. Having reviewed the evidence it appears to me it was open to the judge to find beyond reasonable doubt that the act of the applicant was done with intent to kill. Any evidence raising self-defence only came to light at the trial and was not raised by the applicant to the three witnesses who were his guests and it is wholly inconsistent with the evidence of the witness Gould. 

55It is the fact that on 9 July 2010 when passing sentence the trial judge said the Crown case at trial was limited to an assertion the act was done with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. That was a mistake made one year after the trial where a third head of murder, namely reckless indifference to human life, had been left for consideration of the jury. 

56I do not believe this caused her Honour to fall into error in determining for herself the basis of the jury's verdict. She referred in particular to the fact the applicant was waiting to confront the deceased about the stolen wallet and that he confessed to Gould some days later that he plunged a large knife into the deceased's chest. There was also the evidence of Gould about an earlier conversation where the applicant said ""he was going to stab him next time he came round"" and also the intercepted conversation with his daughter after the event in October 2007 when he said of the deceased ""at least I put him down."" 

57The evidence does justify concluding beyond reasonable doubt the applicant intended to kill the deceased and accordingly, I would dismiss this ground of appeal. 


Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in finding that the offence fell within the mid range of objective seriousness 
58In Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 at paragraph 37 Spigelman CJ said: 
""Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour."" 

59Here it is asserted the error occurred because the Crown's position was the offence fell below the mid range of seriousness and at first the judge appeared to accept that, on the basis the act of the applicant was impulsive. It is further submitted that if the act was not done with intent to kill, it was not mid range. It is argued there was only one stab wound, that the sentencing judge gave only minimal effect to the drugs the applicant had taken, that her Honour mistakenly concluded the applicant intended to confront the deceased and that the mental disabilities of the applicant militated against the finding the offence fell within the mid range. 

60As I have indicated, the sentencing judge was entitled to find the act was done with intent to kill and in my view the judge was bound to find that in this case. Often there are varying considerations which might lead to different conclusions about where in the range a particular offence falls and it is not surprising that at the submission stage her Honour might have entertained the possibility of the offence falling below mid range, particularly because there was only one stab wound. On the other hand, the evidence of Mr Gould did establish an intention to use a knife when confronting the deceased and the evidence does establish the applicant plunged the knife into the deceased's chest. The evidence of the effect of drugs on the applicant was minimal and it was appropriate for her Honour to so find. The mental disabilities of the applicant were obviously relevant on this issue but they were considered by the sentencing judge and I do not believe the evidence of brain damage was such as to justify a finding that for that reason the matter fell below mid range. I would dismiss this ground of appeal. 

Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in respect to the need for protection of the community 
61The sentencing judge found that the applicant does have brain damage which impacts adversely on his mental functioning but she was not persuaded that it significantly diminished his moral culpability for the death of the deceased. She said: 
""This is not only because his brain injury is one of a number of explanations or possible explanations identified by Dr Allnutt for his conduct in arming himself and stabbing the knife into the chest of the deceased, but the offender's behaviour before, immediately after, and then some days after the offence militated against allowing any relaxation of his moral culpability."" 

62It is said that her Honour's finding that general deterrence has less significance because of his mental illness is inconsistent with that. 

63In Veen v The Queen (No. 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ at page 473 it was said: 
""The distinction in principle is clear between an extension merely by way of preventive detention, which is impermissible, and an exercise of the sentencing discretion having regard to the protection of society among other factors, which is permissible."" 

64Dr Allnutt, in a report of 14 February 2009, said: 
""Your client provided a history of a temperamental tendency to being aggressive on occasions commencing in childhood and persisting to adulthood. ... Your client describes experiencing anxiety in crowded places, feeling easily irritable and quick anger when people are close to him..."" 

65Dr Reid, a clinical neuropsychologist, in a report of 3 December 2009 said: 
""Following his head injury he reports a change in his behaviour where he developed agoraphobia, became more impulsive and aggressive and hypersensitive to people coming in close physical contact with him."" 

66Dr Allnutt in a report of 16 December 2009 said: 
""... it would be reasonable to conclude that there were a number of elements active at the material time of the alleged offence included inborn tendency to impulsive aggression, substance intoxication, depressive symptoms, an acrimonious relationship with the deceased and frontal lobe brain damage (increasing his vulnerability to impulsive behaviour)."" 

67Dr Lowe, a consultant neurologist, in a report of 1 June 2010 said of the applicant: 
""In particular, he has suffered mood swings and very poor temper control. He describes himself as hostile and physically aggressive."" 

68He went on to say: 
""In my opinion Mr Sullivan's capacity for critical judgment and insightful thinking would be extremely limited."" 

69The sentencing judge was concerned at the criminal history of the applicant which included a conviction for manslaughter on 19 March 1987. That apparently was also an act done with the use of a knife and the Crown accepted a plea of guilty to manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility. He was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment from 15 July 1986 with a non-parole period of 12 years. He was released to parole on 24 March 1994 having been given remissions under the penal system as it then existed. The sentence would not have expired in its entirety until 14 July 2002. He was in fact convicted of further offences not involving violence in 1988, 1995, 1996, 1997 twice, 1999, 2000 and February 2002. Apparently his parole was not revoked. 

70In view of the medical reports and the criminal history of the applicant, the evidence in my view established beyond reasonable doubt there was a need for the protection of society. In Veen (No. 2) (supra) at page 477 it was said: 
""It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind."" 

71I believe the sentencing judge was justified on the evidence in coming to the conclusions she did. 

Ground 4: The sentence imposed was unduly harsh and severe 
72It is conceded that if the sentencing judge's findings are upheld, the sentence imposed was within range. I believe that concession is justified. I would uphold the judge's findings and on that basis I would dismiss the appeal against severity of sentence. 

73I propose the following orders: 

(1) Grant an extension of time to appeal against conviction and to seek leave to appeal against sentence. 

(2) Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 

(3) Dismiss the appeal against conviction and sentence. 

74HISLOP J: I agree with Blanch J.

		22 March 2012",2012-03-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2416583,R v HENG [2012] NSWDC 58,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Since the age of twelve Christopher Heng has been a user of illegal drugs. He began by smoking marijuana, then progressed to using ice. Shortly before his nineteenth birthday he was using ice, marijuana and alcohol on a daily basis. He wanted to get some more drugs to use on the day of his nineteenth birthday and for that he needed money. Accordingly, he and a co-offender, who was a juvenile, committed an armed robbery in broad daylight on a person who had the misfortune to use his iPhone 4 on a train.

2It was in the early afternoon of 30 August 2011 that Mr Paul Clarke got into the train at Central in order to travel to Caringbah. He was using his iPhone 4 to listen to music and surf the net. He was spotted by this offender and his juvenile co-offender and, on the spur of the moment, they decided they would rob him. Mr Heng sat behind him before reaching forward and covering Mr Clarke's mouth and nose with his hand and presented a knife, holding it against the side of Mr Clarke's face. The offender said, ""This is a knife, do what I say or I will cut you."" Sensibly Mr Clarke did what he was told to do. He allowed the offenders to take his phone and wallet. They also searched his backpack but found nothing worth taking. The two offenders left the train.

3Mr Clarke went into another carriage and spoke to a person there who turned out to be an off duty police officer. Other police arrived and enquiries commenced in an effort to identify the offenders. Fortunately CCTV footage showed the two offenders and they were identified. A search warrant was carried out at the offender's premises where police discovered incriminating material.

4The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to this charge and so the sentence I will impose upon him will be twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been. He has remained in custody since his arrest on the day the search warrant was executed.

5When I sentence him he also asks that I take into account four other offences on a Form 1. These all relate to offences committed by Mr Heng in the early hours of 27 April 2011. The offender and a number of other people were hanging around the bus station when they discovered a large can of white paint. The offender and another threw the paint onto the ground and commenced to jump and slide in it, leaving paint marks on the roadway. That is an offence of malicious damage to property.

6Next the offender was part of a group which stole a shoulder bag from a person who was waiting at a bus stop. Then having travelled by train to Hurstville railway station the offender received an Apple iPad which another member of the group had taken from an unlocked utility parked near the railway station. Finally, when police looked through the offender's property after having searched him upon his arrest for these three matters I have just set out, they discovered 112 My Zone bus tickets. That is an offence of goods in custody.

7All of the offences I have outlined were committed whilst the offender was on two s 9 bonds imposed in the Downing Centre Local Court for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and an offence of goods in custody. When the matter first came before me no one had advised the magistrate that the bonds had been breached and so the matter was adjourned until today part heard so that I could properly consider issues regarding concurrency and accumulation.

8The offender was born in Sydney in 1992 to parents who had come to Australia from Cambodia about thirty years ago as refugees. He is the youngest of six siblings. He did reasonably well at school, getting good grades, although his poor attendance record led to him being expelled after completing the school certificate. He was asked to leave home when he was sixteen because of what he described as dramas between him and his older siblings. No doubt these dramas are at least partially related to his drug use, which as I mentioned earlier began when he was but twelve years of age. He lived either on the street or at a friend's house for a couple of years. At the time of this offence he was living with his mother.

9Whilst in custody he began studying for the HSC but after being moved from one gaol where the HSC was offered to another gaol where it was not, he had to drop his studies. That is very unfortunate. In the witness box he impressed as an articulate and clever young man. It was my impression that he was capable of doing well in the HSC and the inability of Corrective Services authorities to provide him with an education is unfortunate to say the least.

10Whilst in custody he wrote a letter of apology to Mr Clarke, the victim, although at Mr Kozanecki's suggestion it was not sent. I am satisfied nevertheless that he is remorseful for his offending.

11I should mention the issue of parity. The juvenile offender was dealt with for an offence of robbery in company where he received a control order for twelve months with a non-parole period of twenty weeks. When the offender compares the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence which was imposed upon his juvenile co-offender, he must remember that his co-offender was dealt with for a different offence, in a different jurisdiction and it was not the co-offender who held the knife to Mr Clarke's face.

12The seriousness of the offender's conduct is obvious. People should be able to get trains in broad daylight and use their smart phones without being subject to violence and a threat of it at the hands of people who simply want to get money to buy drugs. The offender and the offence fit quite well into the commonplace scenario postulated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the guideline judgment of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R, with two qualifications, one relating to the timing of the plea and one relating to the circumstance that there are a number of matters on a Form 1 which I must take into account when I sentence Mr Heng. But even though the offence and the offender do fit quite well into the guideline judgment, it is of course well to remember that that case suggests a guideline sentence and that judges are free to depart from the sentence range postulated or suggested in that case where it is appropriate.

13In this case I note that the offender was still eighteen years of age at the time of his offending and so this offence was committed by a person who did not have the maturity that other older offenders might have. The offender has plans for the future. Upon his release from custody he wishes to move to the Central Coast, a place where he has lived before and return to work as a labourer. He accepts the likelihood that it will be necessary for him to do a drug rehabilitation course if he is to maximise his potential by putting his drug using days behind him. Of course, his prospects of rehabilitation largely depend on him giving up illegal drug use.

14I cannot say that the prospects of the offender's rehabilitation are good. They depend very much on what the offender does in relation to drugs when he is released from custody. There are many hopeful signs and so it is possible that the offender will take advantage of opportunities that will be presented to him on his release to parole and take serious steps to deal with his longstanding drug addiction. It is not going to be easy but the offender must know that if he does not make substantial efforts to put his drug using days behind him, he will soon become the sort of person who measures out his life in court dates and custodial sentences. 

15This is the first time the offender has received a custodial sentence in an adult gaol. I hope that he is finding the experience unpleasant. I hope that he is determined therefore to put his offending ways behind him when he is released from custody.

16Of course, it is an aggravating circumstance of this offence that the offender was on two s 9 bonds at the time it was committed. It is important of course also that I do not double count. The offender has been sentenced to imprisonment for the offences having breached his bond and it would be double counting to then sentence the offender to a wholly cumulative sentence and regard the breach of the bonds as a serious aggravating factor. On the other hand, the breach of bonds cannot be ignored. What I will do is to commence the sentence I will shortly announce on 6 December 2011 so that my sentence will be partially accumulative and partially concurrent with the sentences he has received in the Local Court.

17Of course, there are special circumstances in this case. They relate to the offender's youth, the need for him to be supervised upon his release from custody in an effort to do as much as can be done to get him off drugs and of course there is the more technical aspect of accumulation which would in itself justify a finding of special circumstances.

18It is clear, as I said before, that the offender's conduct was very serious indeed. And the Form 1 matters also show in some cases much more than juvenile misbehaviour. The offender needs to be personally deterred from committing further offences. There is no reason that the full measure of general deterrence should not be visited upon this offender even despite his relative youth. And more fundamentally perhaps, the courts need to mark in a very concrete way the wrongfulness of what the offender did. I repeat, members of the community are entitled to get public transport and use their smart phones without having a knife presented to them by those who seem to care little about the consequences of their actions beyond a desire to obtain money for drugs.

19The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years to date from 6 December 2011 and a head sentence of three and a half years. The non-parole period will expire on 5 December 2013, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		03 May 2012",2012-03-29 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2416715,Lute v R [2012] NSWCCA 67,"Judgment

1EX TEMPORE - WHEALY JA: This is an application for leave to appeal on sentence. Michael John Lute (""the applicant"") was sentenced by her Honour, Judge Syme (""the sentencing judge""), on 16 November 2010 in the District Court at Taree. The applicant was sentenced with respect to one count of driving in a manner dangerous causing death. This offence is contrary to s 52A(1)(c) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). It carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment.

2The applicant pleaded guilty on the day of trial, having earlier pleaded guilty and then withdrawn his plea. Her Honour allowed a discount of 15% for the utilitarian value of the plea.

3The applicant was sentence to a non-parole period of two years and three months commencing on 16 November 2010 and to expire on 15 February 2013. The total sentence imposed was one of three years and nine months, to expire on 15 August 2014. Her Honour found special circumstances and varied the statutory ratio so that the non-parole period was about 60% of the total sentence.

4There is no dispute about the facts found by her Honour. The applicant and the deceased ""Fox"" (formerly known as Marcus Boyden) were friends and lived in the Gloucester area. The applicant had been drinking with a group of friends at the Roundabout Inn in Gloucester on the evening in question. About 10.30pm, the bar attendant noted signs of intoxication in the applicant and declined to serve him any further. The applicant left the hotel shortly before 11pm. 

5Around 11.55pm, the applicant was driving his Holden Commodore utility in Park Street, with the deceased as his passenger. The applicant drove his utility along a 300m straight stretch of roadway that had recently been realigned and replaced with a new sealed surface. Upon reaching a long left sweeping curve in the road, he travelled across double unbroken separation lines and drove off the opposite side of the roadway. The vehicle travelled onto a grass verge, where it commenced to slide and then collided heavily with a post and rail timber fence. The vehicle continued through the fence, eventually colliding with a large gum tree. Tragically, the deceased had been impaled by some of the fence railings. The applicant himself received serious injuries in the accident. The police were unable to establish the exact speed at which the vehicle was being driven at the time of the accident. There was police opinion, however, that the speed of the vehicle was ""well in excess"" of the prevailing 60kmh.

6The sole ground of appeal relied on is that the sentencing judge erred in regarding death as an aggravating feature when sentencing for an offence of driving in a manner dangerous causing death. 

7Mr Dennis of counsel for the applicant submitted, correctly, that in relation to the present offence the fact of death is, of course, an element of the offence. Had her Honour regarded the fact of death as an aggravating feature, this would have been an error.

8The relevant passage on which reliance is placed appears at a portion of her Honour's thorough and comprehensive remarks on sentence, where she had been examining the guideline judgment in R v Whyte ([2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252). Her Honour said:
""Whyte's case, in discussing what is a typical case, also referred to some potential areas of the facts where there could be aggravating features and some of those features exist in Mr Lute's position. Firstly, the extent and nature of the injuries inflicted. Fox's death was virtually instant, as far as I can ascertain, but of course that is the ultimate injury to another human being. The Court must also take into account when considering aggravating features the number of people put at risk. There was only one passenger in the car, the deceased. However other road users were potentially put at risk.""

9I am not satisfied that the sentencing judge fell into the error that is the substance of the ground of appeal. When the extract I have quoted is read in context it will be seen that her Honour was doing no more than itemising a number of the features set out in the guideline judgment in Whyte. In that decision this Court considered the offence both in respect of death and in relation to grievous bodily harm. It is clear that her Honour was saying no more than that the deceased died virtually instantaneously, as a finding of fact.

10That this is so appears quite clearly from the decision read as a whole. For example, in making her findings subsequently as to the aggravating features of the offence, she cited excessive speed and the level of intoxication. She did not include the fact of the death of the applicant's passenger.

11In any event, if I were wrong in the conclusion I have reached, I would nevertheless find that the applicant has not demonstrated that a lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW); R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [79] and [100]. Given the amount of alcohol consumed and the apparent speed at which the vehicle was being driven, this was a very serious offence. While it is true that the applicant had clearly demonstrated remorse, had suffered serious injuries himself, and generally had a number of subjective circumstances in his favour, a sentence of the severity of that imposed was required.

12I am unable to detect any error in her Honour's sentencing remarks.

13I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.

14BLANCH CJ at DC: I agree.

15BEECH-JONES J: I agree.

		24 April 2012",2012-04-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2416832,R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86,"Judgment

1The respondent, Ismail Belghar, was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment which was filed on 11 February 2011. The Crown subsequently sought to amend the indictment and with the consent of the respondent leave was granted for this to occur. However, the respondent was not arraigned on the amended indictment. On 20 September 2011 he made an application to be tried by a judge without a jury pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (""the Act""). The application was heard and refused. The respondent appealed that decision to this Court pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. This Court dismissed the appeal, determining that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the application as the respondent had not been arraigned.

2The matter was returned to the District Court where, on 8 March 2012, a further application for a judge-alone trial was listed. On that occasion the respondent was arraigned on an indictment containing the following counts:

""Count 1: attempted murder - s 30, Crimes Act 1900

Count 2: attempt to inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm (alternative to count 1) - ss 33(l)(a) and 344A, Crimes Act 1900

Count 3: intimidation (alternative to counts 1 and 2) (s 13, Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007)

Count 4: assault occasioning actual bodily harm - s 59, Crimes Act 1900.""

3The District Court judge granted the application and ordered that the respondent be tried by judge alone. The Crown appeals that order to this Court pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act.

4The facts which it is anticipated the Crown will seek to prove at the trial have been summarised in the Crown submissions.

5The respondent is the brother-in-law of the complainant, Canan Kokden. As at the time of the alleged offences, he had been married to her older sister, Hanife Kokden, for 11 years.

6On a day in October 2009, the complainant, her sister Hanife and a female friend went to the beach without the respondent's knowledge. When Hanife returned home, the respondent demanded to know where she had been and whom she had been with. When she told him, the respondent telephoned the complainant and said, ""You slut, I'm going to kill you. I'm going to fuck you up. I'm going to find you and kill you. You fucking slut, how dare you take my wife to the beach.""

7At about 8.45 pm on 22 December 2009, the complainant went with her brother, Oktay Kokden, and his two daughters to Broadway Shopping Centre. By coincidence, the respondent and Hanife were also at Broadway Shopping Centre that night. Upon entering the shopping centre from the car park, the complainant saw the respondent and Hanife and turned back towards the car park in order to avoid the respondent, who she had not seen or spoken to since the telephone call. Oktay and his daughters entered the shopping centre and spoke with the respondent and Hanife.

8The complainant walked into the car park and sat on an internal handrail of the walkway facing the entry to the shopping centre (""the internal railing""). The internal railing had a second rail below it and the complainant placed her feet on this bottom rail as she sat on the higher rail. She made a call on her mobile telephone to a friend.

9The respondent walked out of the shopping centre and towards the complainant with a key in his right hand. He stood in front of her and put his face against hers and said, ""I'm going to kill you. I'm going to fucking kill you."" The respondent slapped the complainant once with an open right hand to the left side of her face. The respondent then bent down, put his arms around the complainant's legs and waist and picked her up from the railing. He carried her to the railing on the boundary of the car park (""the external railing"") and held her over it to the extent that she could see the roadway below. The complainant was crying uncontrollably and believed she was going to die.

10At that time, the complainant's brother Oktay tackled the respondent, freeing the complainant, who fell to the ground within the car park. She ran into the shopping centre in distress. The respondent walked away and drove off, leaving Hanife behind. Security officers attended to the complainant and contacted the police. The complainant's sunglasses were later found on the road below the car park where the incident occurred.

11The respondent was arrested on 23 December 2009 and participated in an electronically recorded interview with police. He denied assaulting the complainant and stated that he only picked her up from her seated position on the internal railing because she started to lose her balance while swearing at him. He feared that she would fall and he did not want her to injure herself.

The legislation

12Section 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act now provides:

""132 Orders for trial by Judge alone

(1)An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a trial by judge order).

(2) The court must make a trial by judge order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone.

(3) If the accused person does not agree to being tried by a Judge alone, the court must not make a trial by judge order.

(4) If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so.

(5) Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.

(6) The court must not make a trial by judge order unless it is satisfied that the accused person has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of such an order from an Australian legal practitioner.

(7) The court may make a trial by judge order despite any other provision of this section or section 132A if the court is of the opinion that: 

(a) there is a substantial risk that acts that may constitute an offence under Division 3 of Part 7 of the Crimes Act 1900 are likely to be committed in respect of any jury or juror, and
(b)the risk of those acts occurring may not reasonably be mitigated by other means.""

13The section was amended to take its present form by the Courts and Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Act 2010. The section previously provided that a judge could only order that a trial be by judge without a jury in circumstances where both the accused and the Crown agreed. When the amending legislation was introduced, the Attorney-General said in the Second Reading Speech that the amendment was instigated by a proposal from the Chief Judge of the District Court in late 2009 that the Director of Public Prosecutions' veto power be removed from section 132 by allowing a court to settle the dispute if the prosecution and defence cannot agree on the issue of trial by a judge alone. 

14The Attorney-General said that ""judge-alone trials are appropriate in a limited number of circumstances."" He identified circumstances where there may be concerns that pre-trial publicity cannot be satisfactorily overcome or where the evidence of the trial is likely to be highly technical as examples of when a judge alone trial may be appropriate.

The reasons of the trial judge

15The trial judge had the benefit of comprehensive written submissions from the parties. His Honour's reasons were delivered in an informal manner and were shortly stated. His Honour said that he agreed with the Crown that an applicant bears the onus of proof. Relying upon the decision in Arthurs v The State of Western Australia [2007] WASC 182 at [79] his Honour accepted that it is relevant to the ""interests of justice"" that an accused person, because of their religious or cultural circumstances, is concerned that he or she may not get a fair trial by a jury. His Honour concluded that:

""the attitude of the [respondent] regarding the sister-in-law victim is based on a religious or cultural basis and in light of the fact that there has been adverse publicity regarding persons who hold extreme Muslim faith beliefs in the community, I am of the view that the apprehension by the [respondent] that he may not receive a fair trial is a reasonable apprehension."" 

16His Honour then identified the fact that the Crown could not point to any prejudice that the Crown ""or the community"" faces in relation to the application. He invited the prosecutor to address him on that issue and in the course of an exchange with counsel said: 

""The reason for the animosity between the applicant and the victim as suggested by the Crown will be that the victim took the applicant's wife to the beach where the applicant's wife displayed her body because she was seen by the applicant to be sunburnt in her certain places on her body and this was abhorrent to the applicant by virtue of either his strict religious beliefs or by virtue of the fact that he believed he had absolute authority over the wife as opposed to the wife's family having some authority over her.""

17His Honour contrasted the position with a case which may have involved attitudes towards the Muslim faith in general, saying:

""In this particular case there is direct reference to aspects of the Muslim faith which may cause a jury to take their mind off the central issue which is a single issue, that is, what was the intent of the applicant at the point in time that he came into contact with the victim at the Broadway shopping centre.""

18His Honour later said:

""In this particular case it really relates insofar as the Crown case is concerned as to his state of mind, and the rage created by his either faith (sic) or the culture that he had absolute control over the wife.""

19His Honour then said:

""I feel that the application should be granted""

20He continued:

""and I do so on the basis that the Crown has not been able to demonstrate to me any prejudice that the Crown faces or any prejudice that the community faces in relation to the granting of the application.""

21The Crown Prosecutor expressly acknowledged that he did not require the trial judge to give further reasons.

22Having regard to the way the matter proceeded, there is an ambiguity in his Honour's reasoning. However, a fair reading suggests that his Honour concluded that the respondent apprehended that he may not get a fair trial by a jury because of his religious or cultural circumstances and, for that reason, in the absence of any prejudice to the Crown or the community, determined that it was in the interests of justice to grant the application. 

Trial by jury and trial by judge alone

23Before turning to consider the issues raised in this appeal, it is instructive to reflect on the origin of trial by jury and the more recent intervention by legislatures to provide the alternative procedure of a trial by a judge alone. The trend in recent years has been toward the use of judge-alone trials - the trend being more pronounced in the resolution of civil disputes. As is apparent from the decisions of judges, both in England and Australia, any suggestion that trial by jury should be confined, either for the trial of civil disputes or crimes, can arouse a strong response from many lawyers: see, for instance, Ford v Blurton (1922) 38 TLR 801 at 805 (Atkin LJ); Brown v The Queen [1986] HCA11; (1986) 160 CLR 171 at 201-203 (Deane J), 216-217 (Dawson J); J, S, M v R [2010] EWCA Crim 1755 at 8 (Judge LCJ). However, notwithstanding its many supporters, the Parliaments of many of the States have legislated to increase the opportunity for judge-alone trials: see Supreme Court Act 1933 (ACT) s 68B; Criminal Code (Qld) s 615 and Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) Sch 1; Juries Act 1927 (SA) s 7; Criminal Procedure Act 2004 (WA) s 118. 

24In AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; (2008) 232 CLR 438, an appeal concerned with defects in the reasons of a judge who tried an alleged offender without a jury, Heydon J discussed the nature and benefits of trial by jury and trial by judge alone. His Honour drew upon statements by Lord Devlin, a strong supporter of jury trials, describing them as the ""lamp that shows that freedom lives"" (Lord Devlin, Trial by Jury (rev ed, 1966 at 164). Heydon J discussed five advantages of trial by jury which had been identified by Lord Devlin. His Honour said: 

""First, Lord Devlin thought juries were superior to judges in assessing defence points: ""the hope of the defence very often lies in impalpabilities - the willingness to make allowances for muddle-headedness, illogicalities and unreasonableness - impalpabilities that are less appealing to the legal mind than to the lay"". He said: ""[I]t is an essential part of the system that the law should recognise that there are cases in which such factors should be dominating."" 

Secondly, Lord Devlin also saw juries as being superior to judges in assessing credibility: 

'[T]he jury is the best instrument for deciding upon the credibility or reliability of a witness and so for determining the primary facts. Whether a person is telling the truth, when it has to be judged, as so often it has, simply from the demeanour of the witness and his manner of telling it, is a matter about which it is easy for a single mind to be fallible. The impression that a witness makes depends upon reception as well as transmission and may be affected by the idiosyncrasies of the receiving mind; the impression made upon a mind of twelve is more reliable. Moreover, the judge, who naturally by his training regards so much as simple that to the ordinary man may be difficult, may fail to make enough allowance for the behaviour of the stupid. The jury hear the witness as one who is as ignorant as they are of lawyers' ways of thought; that is the great advantage to a man of judgment by his peers.'

Lord Devlin also saw a third advantage in trial by jury: 

'[M]inisters of justice have to serve two mistresses - the law and the aequum et bonum or the equity of the case. Their constant endeavour is to please both. That is why the just decision fluctuates ... between two points. In most systems the just decision is tied pretty closely to the law; the law may be made as flexible as possible, but the justice of the case cannot go beyond the furthest point to which the law can be stretched. Trial by jury is a unique institution, devised deliberately or accidentally - that is, its origin is accidental and its retention deliberate - to enable justice to go beyond that point.'

He considered that trial by jury had a ""unique merit"" in ""that it allows a decision near to the aequum et bonum to be given without injuring the fabric of the law, for the verdict of a jury can make no impact on the law"". Thus Lord Devlin saw the jury as being for some purposes ""the best judicial instrument"". A clear illustration of this role of the jury is seen when the jury decides whether the facts it finds answer certain legal criteria. That phenomenon is recognised by s 118(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act, for the court may refuse to order trial by judge alone ""if it considers the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards such as an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness"". Other examples of factual issues requiring the application of ""objective community standards"" include whether behaviour was ""threatening, abusive or insulting""; whether conduct was ""dishonest"", a matter to be decided by the jury ""according to the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people""; whether an assault is ""indecent""; and whether an accused person had a particular intention. 

Lord Devlin saw a fourth advantage of jury trial which was ""of great importance in the constitution. The ... existence of trial by jury helps to ensure the independence and quality of the judges."" 

A fifth advantage detected by Lord Devlin was: 

'[T]rial by jury ... gives protection against laws which the ordinary man may regard as harsh and oppressive. I do not mean by that no more than that it is a protection against tyranny. It is that: but it is also an insurance that the criminal law will conform to the ordinary man's idea of what is fair and just. If it does not, the jury will not be a party to its enforcement. They have in the past used their power of acquittal to defeat the full operation of laws which they thought to be too hard.'

In this respect, an accused person who is tried by judge alone is in a very different position from one tried by jury. A jury may have no right to acquit in the face of evidence, but, unlike a judge sitting alone, it has a power to do so, and a power which it is impossible to control on appeal because of traditional limitations on the capacity of the prosecution to appeal from acquittals. In R v Shipley, Lord Mansfield CJ said:

'It is the duty of the Judge, in all cases of general justice, to tell the jury how to do right, though they have it in their power to do wrong, which is a matter entirely between God and their own consciences.'

As Lord Goddard CJ told the House of Lords in 1955, ""no one has yet been able to find a way of depriving a British jury of its privilege of returning a perverse verdict"". A judge cannot tell a jury to convict, for that would be to make the judge ""decide the case and not the jury, which is not the common law"". The Criminal Procedure Act has gone a step further from the common law by making the judge decide the case without any jury being present at all. The fact-finding procedures of juries thus can be marked by a kind of benign irrationality, for it is open to juries to acquit in the face of very strong evidence merely because they dislike some aspect of the law being enforced, or the behaviour of the police, or the testimony of prosecution witnesses or the conduct of the judge. A judge sitting alone, however, is expected to conform in all respects with rational criteria - the criteria commanded by applicable rules of law, and the criteria imposed by the ""logical faculty"" - in assessing the credibility of witnesses, in weighing the probabilities of particular events having happened and in drawing inferences from primary facts."" (footnotes omitted)

25Heydon J also recognised that not everyone admires jury trial and identified what his Honour referred to as the ""irrational"" aspects of trial by jury in criminal cases. His Honour said:

""The selection of 12 as the number of jurors has never been satisfactorily explained. Jurors are expected to understand, remember - on occasions for months - and weigh evidence, which is sometimes not given clearly or is complicated in character, often without ever having done this before. They are expected to grasp and apply sometimes complex propositions of law, almost always without any prior experience of or training in this activity. Many jurors were and are ""unaccustomed to severe intellectual exercise or to protracted thought"". The development of jury trial has been ""irrational"" in the sense that the jury began, against the background of irrational modes of trial like trial by ordeal and trial by battle, as a body selected for the very reason that the jurors, men of the neighbourhood, had knowledge of the facts relating to the dispute. In this respect it was superior to those rival modes of trial shortly to be forbidden by the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. But now persons who have any prior knowledge of the dispute or the protagonists in it are likely to be excluded from the jury. The jury is now a body which knows nothing, beyond the teachings of common experience and what may be judicially noticed, except what witnesses tell it or supply to it. It began in order to serve one function; it came to serve another; and its role in performing that latter function has been deliberately preserved.""

26Heydon J discussed the protection afforded an accused person flowing from the jury's right to return a perverse verdict and recognised the benefits derived from the obligation of a jury to return a unanimous verdict. Of course, in some jurisdictions, including New South Wales, that principle has been eroded: see Juries Act 1927 (SA) s 57; Criminal Code (NT) s 368; Juries Act 2003 (Tas) ss 3, 43; Criminal Procedure Act 2004 (WA) s 114; Jury Act 1977 (NSW) s 55F(3); Juries Act 2000 (Vic) s 46. Trial by judge alone removes the principle of unanimity by multiple decision makers but, as Heydon J indicated, it is replaced by the duty of a judge to give reasons which ""can operate to safeguard the interests of the accused and the public interest generally"": at [104]. His Honour continued: ""that is because a move to trial by judge alone causes appeals to operate in a radically different way. It is much easier for an appellate court to detect appellable error where reasons for the verdict at trial must be provided than it is when the appellate court is limited only to the record of the proceedings before a jury.""

27Trial by jury of civil disputes has, at least in New South Wales, virtually disappeared. It remains for defamation cases, although it is burdened in those cases by the many practical difficulties inherent in explaining the arcane principles of defamation law to laypersons. The move to judge-alone trials was not without controversy: Statement of the Bar Council of the New South Wales Bar Association, Your Right to a Jury Trial (1965); see also Ian Barker QC, Sorely Tried: Democracy and Trial by Jury in NSW, Francis Forbes Lecture Series (2002) at 242. However, it continues today with only the occasional suggestion that a jury trial would be preferable or that individuals or corporations have suffered any injustice by not having a jury decide their case. As Heydon J pointed out, it enhances the capacity for appellate review, the facts being first determined by the trial judge and subject to reconsideration by the Court of Appeal. Many would accept that there is a benefit by having four judicial minds applied to the task of discerning the appropriate law and applying it to the facts: see Lord Devlin, Trial by Jury at 134-135.

28A measure of the controversy can be seen in the decision of the Court of Appeal in Pambula District Hospital v Herriman (1988) 14 NSWLR 387. The case concerned proceedings by a patient of the hospital who sued in negligence. The plaintiff requested that the Court dispense with a jury pursuant to s 89(1) of the Supreme Court Act. That section empowers the court to order that issues of fact be tried without a jury.

29Section 89(1) was set against the background that the Supreme Court Act, with certain exceptions, provided that proceedings were to be tried without a jury. However, in proceedings on common law claims, parties could requisition a jury pursuant to ss 86 and 87. Section 88 provided that certain proceedings, including those involving issues of fraud or defamation and some others, were to be tried with a jury. The defendant sought a jury.

30The application of s 89(1) had proved controversial and the Common Law judges had divided opinions as to the matters relevant to deciding whether to dispense with a jury. The nature of that controversy has relevance to the present case. It concerned whether matters of more general concern, including efficiency, cost and the predictability of verdicts, were relevant considerations. As it happened, the Court of Appeal divided. Kirby P and Samuels JA upheld the appeal, while Mahoney JA dissented. 

31Kirby P recorded the arguments in favour of the ""right to trial by jury"" in terms which echo the words of many supporters of trial by jury in criminal trials. I can do no better than repeat the President's discussion of the issue (at 394-395):

""The appellant argued that the right to trial by jury, even in a civil action and even in the somewhat circumscribed terms provided by the Act, was a precious civic right. The extent that this was so, so it was argued, could be gleaned from the ancient lineage of jury trials, the general satisfaction felt with jury awards, the opportunity thereby provided for the involvement of citizens and their values in the administration of justice and the numerous judicial encomiums about jury trials both in England and in this country: cf Blackstone, Commentaries, Book IV, 349-350 where the jury is described as the ""sacred bulwark of the nation"". Typical of like judicial observations are the remarks of Atkin LJ in Ford v Blurton (1922) 38 TLR 801 at 805, when his Lordship was reluctantly driven to the conclusion that s 2(1) of the Administration of Justice Act 1920 (UK) deprived a party of trial by jury: 

'... for the first time in history the British subject is permanently deprived of his right to have common law actions tried by a jury. For the future the right to a jury is taken away. Whether a jury shall try a dispute is left to the uncontrolled discretion of a Master or a Judge ... I speak reluctantly because I cannot bring myself to believe that this far-reaching result was intended by the Legislature. Trial by jury, except in the very limited classes of cases assigned to the Chancery Court, is an essential principle of our law. It has been the bulwark of liberty, the shield of the poor from the oppression of the rich and powerful. Anyone who knows the history of our law knows that many of the liberties of the subject were originally established and are maintained by the verdicts of juries in civil cases. Many will think that at the present time the danger of attack by powerful private organizations or by encroachments of the executive is not diminishing. It is not without importance that the right now taken away is expressly established as part of the American constitution. A wise and temperate discussion of the whole question will be found in the second report, dated April 30, 1853, of the Common Law Commissioners, appointed in 1850. Hitherto, notwithstanding the far-reaching changes of the Judicature Acts, the right to trial by jury has been substantially maintained. The right to a jury, up to 1918, had always been asserted in express terms in the rules of the Supreme Court ... The war resulted in the temporary withdrawal of the right to a jury ... There already existed a rule that a Judge might direct trial without a jury in cases where an action required prolonged examination of documents or accounts or any scientific or local examination which ... could not conveniently be made by a jury ... I do not myself see any inconvenience in trying before a jury contested facts, even though upon their ascertainment questions of law may emerge. It seems to me to be everyday practice to try such cases with a jury.'

Atkin LJ closed his judgment with an appeal for a Parliamentary reconsideration of the section.

The normal method of trial in all civil cases in England, for five hundred years, was by jury: see Ward v James [1966] 1 QB 273. In that case, it was pointed out in argument that the civil jury was the foundation of our liberties and is a ""common law right which is highly valued"". The withdrawal of the right during the First World War was referred to, as was its substantial restoration by the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933 (UK).

Ward v James is one of a number of cases in England at about the same time which examined the operation of the Rules of the Supreme Court, O 36, r 1(3), made pursuant to s 6 of the 1933 Act. That rule provided a general discretion in a judge to ""determine whether the trial is to be with or without a jury"". Specifically it provided that the discretion was ""an absolute one"". Special provision was made by s 6 of the 1933 Act for trial by jury in reputational cases and unless the court was of the opinion that the trial required prolonged examination of documents, etcetera. It is plain that the lineage of s 88 and s 89(2) of the Supreme Court Act may be traced to these provisions and those which went before them in England. 

The language used in the English authorities must, however, be approached with caution in this State. This is not only because of the significantly different terms in which the legislation of the two jurisdictions is expressed. It is also because, in the judicial elaboration of the statute and Rules of Court in England, the judges appear to have introduced a requirement on the part of the applicant for jury trial to show ""special circumstances"", although such requirement is not provided for either in the Act or the rules: see, eg, Watts v Manning [1964] 1 WLR 623; [1964] 2 All ER 267; Hennell v Ranaboldo [1963] 1 WLR 1391; [1963] 3 All ER 684 and Sims v William Howard & Son Ltd [1964] 2 QB 409.

Examination of these and other decisions of the English Court of Appeal suggest that the introduction of the necessity to show ""special circumstances"" to secure trial by jury of a personal injuries action was based upon judicial policy. That, in turn, appears to have been grounded in a stated concern about the suggested excess of some jury verdicts and the need to secure comparability of awards of personal injury damages in like cases. It is worth remarking in the present appeal upon the irony that here the applicant for trial by jury is the defendant in such an action whereas it is the plaintiff who seeks trial by judge alone.

There is nothing in s 89 of the Act or any of the surrounding sections, to require that ""special circumstances"" be shown to warrant either the retention or discharge of a jury to try a common law damages action. When under the Act Parliament required ""special grounds"" to appear before an order of a particular kind should be made, it so enacted: see, eg, 75A(8) of the Act. Therefore reliance upon English authority elaborating different legislative provisions and evincing a judicial policy which might not be appropriate for this State, involves dangers. Safer by far is adherence to the language of the Act, read in the context of its local history.

Agitation for jury trial in the New South Wales colony began as early as 1791: see J M Bennett, ""The Establishment of Jury Trial in New South Wales"" (1961) 3 Syd L Rev 463 at 464. Successive Governors, from the earliest times, favoured the provision of juries, particularly in criminal trials. The earliest court for the trial of civil actions, the Civil Court, which first convened in July 1788, did not provide for jury trial. Nor did the Supreme Court established by the Charter of Justice of 1814. It was the New South Wales Act of 1823 (4 Geo IV C 96) pursuant to which the present Supreme Court was later established by Charter issued by the Crown, which allowed for the trial of issues of fact by jury if both parties concurred in an application for that purpose. By 9 Geo IV C 83 (1828), the Court was afforded a discretion to allow trial by jury on the application of either party. There was also reserved to the local Legislative Council ""by some general law or ordinance"" to decide ""the qualification, numbers and summonses and other rules for the constitution and proceedings"" of such juries. The history of the gradual introduction of juries in New South Wales is described in essays which have secured fresh attention because of the Bicentenary: see, eg, P H Henchman,"" The New South Wales Jury of Four Persons"" (1959) 33 ALJ 235; J M Bennett (above) and A C Castles, An Australian Legal History (1982) at 75ff: see also M H McHugh ""Jurors' Deliberations, Jury Secrecy, Public Policy and the Law of Contempt"" in M Findlay and P Duff (Eds) The Jury under Attack (1988) at 56, 57. The special provision reducing the civil jury, in the normal case, from twelve (which had been the traditional number in England) to four was introduced by the statute 8 Vic No 4 (1844). In his judgment in Caledonian Collieries Ltd v Fenwick (1959) 76 WN (NSW) 482 at 489f, Else-Mitchell J details this history, including the consolidation of 11 Vic No 20 (1847) which passed into the Jury Act 1912. 

By the end of the nineteenth century jury trial was certainly the normal mode of trial for disputed issues of fact in common law proceedings in the Supreme Court. Section 29 of the Jury Act 1912 so provided. In the last-mentioned case, Else-Mitchell J held that there was both an inherent and statutory power in the Court to determine that a matter should proceed without a jury in certain circumstances. His Honour so ordered in that case. However, the normal rule and practice was as stated. By the 1960s, in this State, as earlier in England, a controversy had arisen about the merits of jury trial of civil causes. That controversy was stimulated by a paper delivered by Wallace J (as the former President was) ""Speedier Justice (and Trial by Ambush)"" (1961) 35 ALJ 124. The paper canvassed various ways by which modification of jury trial, without total abolition, could be introduced to reduce the delays and costs of litigation in the State and to promote greater consistency of decision making. The paper sparked a lively debate at the 12th Australian Legal Convention to which it was read (see especially ibid 140ff). Most of the commentators defended the civil jury by reference to legal authority, judicial opinion and personal experience. But the paper proved influential. In 1965, following a change of government in New South Wales, Parliament enacted the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965. By s 5(1) of that Act, provision was made whereby running down cases would thereafter normally be tried by a judge without a jury. That provision, and s 4 of the 1965 Act (which was associated) became in 1970 the s 87 of the Supreme Court Act. It was that Act which gathered together provisions in relation to jury trial in the Court formerly found in the Jury Act and in other provisions. The terms of the Act are to be understood against the background of the common law rights and statutory arrangements which had obtained in the State before 1970.""

32Kirby P traced the history of juries in civil trials in this State and of the different manifestations of s 89(1). His Honour referred to the Second Reading Speech of the Attorney-General in which the Attorney-General indicated that the legislation was initiated as a response to the delay in hearing cases in the Common Law list, causing significant problems for persons suffering the latter stages of illness occasioned by asbestos. The Attorney-General contrasted New South Wales courts with those in other states, which had had ""a broad discretion to dispense with civil juries where that would be in the interests of justice."" The President noted that those words had not (unlike s 132 of the Act) found their way into the legislation and furthermore emphasised that the Attorney-General had gone on to say that the court would be able, by reason of the amendment, ""to make a decision consistent with the needs of justice in each particular case.""

33In the final analysis, Kirby P concluded that the primary judge had erred by having regard to matters of general convenience rather than the interests of justice in the particular case. The President said at [400]:

""the basic flaw in Cole J's reasoning was in considering to be relevant as such, universal characteristics of jury trials. This was impermissible because the scheme of the legislation assumes that jury trials will continue to be available for proceeding on a common law claim such as this. Indeed, whether or not s 86 of the Act confers a ""right"", strictly so called, it does envisage that a party to proceedings on a common law claim will continue to have an entitlement to requisition a jury. Having done so (as the appellant is to be taken to have done here) the exercise of the discretion called for by s 89 requires the party seeking the alternative mode of trial to discharge the onus to satisfy the Court that it should exercise its discretion upon the particular application made, to order that the trial be had, despite that fact, without a jury. It is therefore not to the point to consider universal characteristics of jury trials. They must be taken to have been known to, and accepted by, Parliament when contemplating that jury trial would continue, except where the discretion under s 89(1) of the Act was exercised.

This is not to say that the general characteristics of jury trials, as such, may not have consequences upon a particular litigant that would warrant account being taken of them, in exercising the discretion under the section as they produce such consequences. Thus, if a litigant were seriously ill or dying, the difficulties and delays of the jury list or of jury trial itself, would certainly be relevant considerations to be taken into account, as Clarke J suggested in Peck v Email Ltd.

There is nothing in the above Parliamentary debates which takes the meaning of the legislation beyond that which emerges from the statute itself.""

34Samuels JA agreed with the President. His Honour said of s 89 (at 412-413):

""The question which a judge exercising discretion under s 89 must ask is not whether trial with a jury or trial by a judge should be ordered as the most efficient means of disposing of litigation of the class in suit, but rather whether there are reasons for concluding that the jury assigned to the case by dint of a party's statutory right (conditional though it may be) should be dispensed with. Moreover, this inquiry must be made in the knowledge that by passing a measure in the terms of s 86 and, especially by leaving it unamended when s 89 was varied, the legislature has indicated that it regards trial with a jury as a proper and acceptable mode of trial in the cases in which it is available. The legislature has not yet concluded that the various matters set out by Cole J in Smoje and placed in the forefront of the appellant's argument on this appeal, are such as to render a jury an incompetent tribunal for determining facts or assessing damages.

It must follow that there can be no room in the exercise of this discretion for consideration of matters which are, as the President has put it, ""of universal application to all jury trials"". The undoubted circumstances that trial by jury is longer, and therefore more expensive, and procedurally more inflexible than trial by judge alone, are not to be taken into account. The legislature clearly must have determined to accommodate them when it provided that, in a particular class of case, a jury might be requisitioned by the act of one party. The same characteristics entail that jury trials tend to clog up the lists and impede the expeditious trial of matters to be dealt with by a judge alone. But this again is an inevitable consequence of preserving trial with a jury. It must, once more, have been intended by the legislature that these detriments must be stoically endured as the appropriate price for the continued employment of civil juries. Whether the value of the commodity is worth the expenditure in time, money, frustration and delay is a debatable question which falls, however, outside the scope of this judgment. It is also, I venture to say, outside the scope of the discretion under discussion, whose exercise cannot, to my mind, involve considerations of how the general dispatch of business in the list can best be promoted; and if the remedy for delay is in part the abolition or reduction of trials with juries, that physic is not a relevant ingredient in the decision whether or not to dispense with the jury requisitioned in the particular case. Accordingly, I agree in general with what the President has written about the necessity to exclude from examination in the exercise of this discretion matters which are wholly general or universal, and which raise only the inherent and inevitable consequences of employing juries in civil trials. The Parliament has decreed that juries are to be retained and that means warts and all. The presence of the warts cannot be used to destroy the picture. They are part of the picture. Accordingly, in order to make good an application to dispense with a jury it is not enough to point to the supposed deficiencies of jury trial. It is necessary to show grounds which are particular to the case in hand. These may of course be produced by the pressure of singular circumstances upon the general character of a jury trial. For example, the state of the jury list, if it entails a delay likely to exceed a plaintiff's life expectancy, would be a matter involving the particular application of a general condition. But the argument (however correct in fact) that to dispense with a jury or two at the top of the list would accelerate hearings at the bottom, would not. Specific difficulties in obtaining the attendance of witnesses might constitute grounds for preferring the greater flexibility (in point of adjournments and otherwise) of non-jury trial and for dispensing with a jury. But the fact that in the instant trial, alike with all other jury trials, there are problems in securing the orderly attendance of expert witnesses would not.""

35The nature of trial by jury and trial by judge alone have been considered on other occasions. In Swain v Waverley Municipal Council [2005] HCA 4, 220 CLR 517, Gleeson CJ discussed the recent trend toward the use of a judge alone rather than jury trial. Although speaking in the context of civil trials, his Honour observed the trend toward reasoned decisions, also acknowledging that involving the public in the administration of justice and keeping the law in touch with community standards were ""important collateral advantages"" of the jury system. The Chief Justice said:

""The resolution of disputed issues of fact, including issues as to whether a defendant's conduct conforms to a requirement of reasonable care, by the verdict of a jury involves committing a decision to the collective and inscrutable judgment of a group of citizens, chosen randomly. The alternative is to commit the decision to a professional judge, who is obliged to give reasons for the decision. In one process the acceptability of the decision is based on the assumed collective wisdom of a number of representatives of the community, properly instructed as to their duties, deciding the facts, on the evidence, as a group. In the other process, the acceptability of the decision is based on the assumed professional knowledge and experience of the judge, and the cogency of the reasons given. In the administration of criminal justice in Australia, the former process is normal, at least in the case of serious offences. In the administration of civil justice, in New South Wales and some other jurisdictions, in recent years there has been a strong trend towards the latter process. Originally, there were no procedures for appealing against the verdict of a jury, reflecting what Barwick CJ described as ""the basic inclination of the law towards early finality in litigation"". He referred, in another case, to the move towards trial by judge alone in civil cases as an abandonment of ""the singular advantage of the complete finality of the verdict of a properly instructed jury"". In many areas, the law seeks to strike a balance between the interest of finality and the interest of exposing and correcting error. In a rights-conscious and litigious society, in which people are apt to demand reasons for any decision by which their rights are affected, the trend away from jury trial may be consistent with public sentiment. Even so, decision-making by the collective verdict of a group of citizens, rather than by the reasoned judgment of a professional judge, is a time-honoured and important part of our justice system. It also has the important collateral advantages of involving the public in the administration of justice, and of keeping the law in touch with community standards."" (footnotes omitted) [7]

36Gibbs CJ in Brown at 179 spoke in similar terms of the ""collateral"" advantages of trial by jury. However, this view may be contrasted with the opinion of Deane and Dawson JJ that trial by jury should not be understood as only conferring a right or privilege on an accused. Deane J said at 202: 

""The institution of trial by jury is also a source of other benefits to the community as a whole. In Kingswell [v The Queen [1985] HCA 72; (1985) 159 CLR 264 at 301-302] I endeavoured to identify the more important of them. It is unnecessary that I repeat what I there said. It suffices to say that the advantages of trial by jury to the community generally serve to reinforce what the plain words of the Constitution convey, namely, that the general prescription of trial by jury as the method of trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth constitutes an element of the structure of government and distribution of judicial power which were adopted by, and for the benefit of, the people of the federation as a whole. To construe the fundamental law of s. 80 as involving no more than the mere conferral of a privilege would be to distort the whole by confining attention to a single aspect.""

37Similarly, Dawson J said at 209:

""Trial by jury is the method selected by s. 80 for the achievement of this high aim in proceedings upon indictment, and there is nothing on the face of that section to suggest that the benefits which it secures may be waived as a matter of choice by either the accused or the prosecution. No doubt the section confers a benefit on every person charged on indictment under a Commonwealth law, but its benefits extend beyond the individual and its guarantee is more than personal.""

38Before turning to decisions of particular relevance to s 132 I should refer to the common law's acceptance, notwithstanding indications that from time to time there may be problems, of the capacity and functioning of the jury in a criminal trial. Under the heading ""the function of the jury"" and in the context of an application for a permanent stay of the trial, by reason of adverse publicity, the High Court in Dupas v The Queen [2010] HCA 20; 241 CLR 237 confirmed that the common law accepts that the jury provided with appropriate directions is a robust institution capable of providing a just decision:

""Nettle JA based his decision upon the footing that to grant an indefinite stay ""would be to recognise that the media has the capacity to render an accused unable to be tried"" and this would deny the 'social imperative' that an accused be brought to trial.

There is an important point here. It is often said that the experience and wisdom of the law is that, almost universally, jurors approach their tasks conscientiously. The point was made as follows by Hughes J, with the endorsement of the English Court of Appeal, in R v Abu Hamza:

'Extensive publicity and campaigns against potential defendants are by no means unknown in cases of notoriety. Whilst the law of contempt operates to minimise it, it is not always avoidable, especially where intense public concern arises about a particular crime and a particular defendant before any charge is brought. Jurors are in such cases capable of understanding that comment in the media might or might not be justified and that it is to find out whether it is that is one of their tasks. They are capable of understanding that allegations which have been made may be true or may not be and that they, the jury, are to have the opportunity and responsibility of hearing all the evidence which commentators in the media have not and of deciding whether in fact the allegations are true or not. They are not surprised to be warned not to take at face value what appears in the media, nor are they these days so deferential to politicians as to be incapable of understanding that they should make no assumptions about whether any statements made by such people are justified or not. They are also capable of understanding and habitually apply the direction that they are given about the standard of proof. 

In his reasons for dismissing the stay application, which are extracted in part and described above, Cummins J used similar terms with respect to the conduct of jury trials in Victoria. 

Earlier, in Gammage v The Queen Windeyer J expressed the governing principle in terms which acknowledged that the jury room might not be a place of undeviating intellectual and logical rigour (a point made by Callinan J in Gilbert v The Queen) by saying:

'A jury in a criminal case may sometimes, from compassion or prejudice or other ulterior motive, fail to perform their sworn duty to determine the case before them according to the evidence. If they do so in favour of the prisoner, and not of the Crown, the law is powerless to correct their dereliction. They must be assumed to have been faithful to their duty. Their verdict must be accepted.'

Conclusions of this kind are not examples of the ""ordinary"" questions of fact which regularly arise for determination. The assumed efficacy of the jury system of which Windeyer J spoke, whereby the law proceeds on the basis that the jury acts on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the judge, represents the policy of the common law and is more akin to a species of 'constitutional fact', in the sense of that term explained by Heydon J in Thomas v Mowbray.

Whilst the criminal justice system assumes the efficacy of juries, that 'does not involve the assumption that their decision-making is unaffected by matters of possible prejudice.' In Glennon, Mason CJ and Toohey J recognised that '[t]he possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial.' What, however, is vital to the criminal justice system is the capacity of jurors, when properly directed by trial judges, to decide cases in accordance with the law, that is, by reference only to admissible evidence led in court and relevant submissions, uninfluenced by extraneous considerations. That capacity is critical to ensuring that criminal proceedings are fair to an accused."" (footnotes omitted)

New South Wales decisions in relation to s 132

39The New South Wales decisions in relation to applications pursuant to s 132 include R v GSR (3) [2011] NSWDC 17. One issue in the case was whether there was an onus on an accused person in relation to an application under the section. Woods DCJ identified three possibilities. First, it could be assumed that there was a ""default"" position of trial by jury which his Honour identified as a presumption in favour of trial by jury rather than by judge alone. Secondly, the reverse position that there ought to be trial by judge alone if the accused asked for it. The third approach, which was the approach that Woods DCJ accepted, was that there was no presumption either way but that the court should ""engage in the exercise of judicially weighing factors relevant to the interests of justice overall"" at [14]). His Honour was influenced in adopting this view by the amendment to the section which removed the requirement for the prosecution to consent to the application. His Honour accepted that ""the interests of the accused"" are relevant (at [16]) to the decision as to whether or not it is in the interests of justice that an accused person be tried by a judge alone.

40In R v Markou [2011] NSWDC 25, Berman DCJ considered and granted an application for a judge alone trial. His Honour concluded that when considering whether it was in the interests of justice that there be a judge alone trial, the likely efficiencies in the conduct of the trial without a jury were relevant considerations. His Honour also considered it relevant that a judge was required to give reasons but a jury was not. His Honour concluded ""that the interests of justice are enhanced by the giving of reasons"" (at [9]).

41His Honour accepted that the default position was that a trial should be held before a jury and acknowledged the role which the community played as members of juries in the administration of justice. However, his Honour concluded that ""where the trial would be quicker, more flexible, and the trial judge would be able to give reasons, I am satisfied that the interests of justice do require that I make the order that the trial be held before a judge alone"" (at [11]).

Decisions in Western Australia

42The first decision in Western Australia of relevance is Arthurs. In that case the solicitor acting for Arthurs had sworn an affidavit in support of the application in which he gave evidence of the significant volume of adverse publicity which preceded his client's trial. He also deposed to the extent of the information available about Arthurs on the internet. 

43After reviewing the evidence, Martin CJ concluded (at [38]) that ""some of the material is likely to have a profoundly disturbing effect, testing the emotional strength of anybody required to review it whether juror or judge.""

44The Western Australian legislation was preceded by a review of the issues by the Law Reform Commission of Western Australia. One of the reasons for the amendment which was identified by the Commission was the prospect that an accused person's trial may be prejudiced by previous media publicity or by evidence which the jury might find revolting.

45Martin CJ reviewed the relevant authorities. He identified two decisions in Western Australia, State of Western Australia v Tarau [2005] WASC 290 and State of Western Australia v Iley [2006] WASC 107, where the application was granted in circumstances where the essential issue was whether an accused person was not guilty by reason of insanity. 

46The third decision which his Honour identified as relevant was that of Heenan J in Western Australia v Martinez [2006] WASC 25; (2006) 159 A Crim R 380. In that case three accused persons, who were jointly indicted on charges of murder, applied for trial without jury. Heenan J observed (at [5]) that the legislation provided no limit on, or elaboration of, the criteria for the grant of such an order and concluded that the discretion of the court to grant an application was at large. His Honour also noted that the legislation provided that, if the issues for the trial require the application of objective community standards, the application may be refused.

47Martin CJ (at [66]-[67]) agreed with Heenan J's view that a judge should not approach an application on the footing that there was a preliminary, presumptive or other inclination that trial by jury must be regarded as the preferential starting point. 

48Martin CJ also referred to the judgment of Deane J in Kingswell v The Queen [1985] HCA 72; (1985) 159 CLR 264, where (at 301) his Honour expressed the view that the community is more likely to accept a jury's verdict than it is to accept the judgment of a judge or magistrate. Martin CJ respectfully declined to accept that view as being of significance in the instant case and emphasised that a judge is required to provide detailed reasons for his or her decision, which can be evaluated both by the community and by any appellate court. His Honour contrasted this position with that of a jury verdict, which he described as ""entirely inscrutable"": (at [74]). The Chief Justice said (at [74]):

""Our community has come to expect reasoned justice in all civil cases, in all summary trials, in all administrative tribunals and at least in the sphere of commonwealth administration the vast majority of administrative decisions.""

49His Honour continued (at [75]):

""The obligation to provide reasons not only disciplines the decision maker but also provides a transparency and capacity for evaluation which the community has come to expect. In that context, the lack of any obligation on the part of a jury to provide reasons is somewhat anomalous but, as I have observed, in my view it is no part of the function of a judge determining an application under s 118 to act upon a general view as to the desirability of one form of trial over another.""

50Martin CJ concluded that the subjective views of an accused person were relevant to the issue, provided they were ""not fanciful or irrational"": at [79]. Accordingly, the Chief Justice concluded that an apprehension by an accused person that he or she may not get a fair trial because of pre-trial publicity or because of his or her ethnic, religious, cultural or other peculiar circumstances may be entitled to significant weight (at [79]). However, his Honour observed that he had no evidence before him of the subjective views of Arthurs save as to what could be inferred from the fact of the application.

51The Chief Justice ultimately concluded that there were no factors which supported trial by jury in the instant case, but there were factors arising from the pre-trial publicity, the availability of reasons and the circumstances of the particular offence which supported a conclusion that it was in the interests of justice that the trial be by judge alone: at [85]-[93].

52In TVM v State of Western Australia [2007] WASC 299 the accused was charged with one count of arson and one count of murder. The accused's solicitor deposed to his knowledge of the accused's belief that, because both he and the deceased were homosexuals and Jehovah's Witnesses who were prominent in the affairs of their sect, he (the accused) may not get a fair trial by jury.

53McKechnie J considered the decisions in both Martinez and Arthurs but concluded that because the legislature had provided a right to make an application for an order for a trial by judge alone, it must be assumed that in the ordinary course a trial should be by jury. His Honour declined to follow the decisions in Arthurs and Martinez in so far as they held that in the resolution of an application a judge starts from a neutral position as to a preferred mode of trial. His Honour said (at [19]):

""In summary, s 118(4) requires a court to do two things. The first is to consider, on information, whether it is in the interests of justice to grant an application for trial by judge alone. If the court so concludes, the next issue is whether to exercise a discretion to grant such an order. In the exercise of that discretion, but without limiting it, the matters, where relevant, contained within s 118(5) and s 118(6) become important.

All this leads me to conclude that, with great respect, I am unable to follow the principle in Arthurs and Martinez that in the resolution of the application a judge starts from a neutral position as to a preferred mode of trial. Instead, it is my view that on an application under s 118 a judge, concluding that it is in the interests of justice for a trial to be held before a judge alone instead of judge and jury, exercises a discretion whether to make the order for trial by judge alone.

In most cases, a finding on the interests of justice is likely to be determinative of the exercise of the discretion to make an order but there may be some occasions where, despite that finding, the discretion is effectively exercised to continue trial by jury.""

54McKechnie J considered the content of the phrase ""interests of justice."" His Honour concluded that the interests of justice are not ""coterminous"" with the interests of an accused (R v Cox [1960] VR 665) and said (at [31]):

""to pay undue account to the subjective views of an accused person, as suggested in Arthurs at [79], [80] may have the result that a decision is really being made for the interests of an accused, not the interests of justice.""

55His Honour expressed his confidence in the jury system of trial, saying (at [32]):

""There is a public interest in the administration of justice carried out in public and in serious cases by the representatives of the public sitting as jurors. The fact that a judge must deliver written reasons, where a jury gives a general verdict, is of no consequence. That is the difference between the two modes of trial provided for by law. The inscrutability of a verdict of 12 is tempered by unanimity. The verdict of 1 is tempered by the exposure of reasons. The interests of justice cannot then be affected by the mode of trial, each being valid.""

56His Honour remarked on the fact that he had no evidence to support the apprehension of the accused that jurors may be biased or prejudiced against homosexuals or Jehovah's Witnesses and concluded that he was ""unpersuaded on the material advanced"" that it was in the interests of justice to make the order (at [36]).

57There is a further Western Australian decision of significance. It is that of Commissioner Sleight in State of Western Australia v Rayney [2011] WASC 326.

58Rayney was charged with murder and the grounds for the application were:

""The grounds of the application (as set out in written submissions) are that it is in the interests of justice to grant the order for a judge alone trial based upon the following:

(a)the extent and the nature of pre-trial publicity has created the danger of a prejudice against the accused;

(b)the accused wishes to waive his right of trial by jury as he is of the view that he will not receive a fair trial.

(c)the trial, due to its complexity and length, is likely to be unreasonably burdensome to a jury;

(d)due to the complexity and length of the trial, it is in the interests of justice that reasons be given for the decision.""

59The application was supported by extensive affidavit material.

60The Commissioner granted the application. In the course of his reasons he determined that the discretion in the relevant section should be exercised in accordance with the following principles:

when considering what is in the interests of justice, a judge does not start from a notion that trial by jury is generally preferable to trial by judge alone (at [17]);

the applicant has (as does any applicant) the burden of convincing the court that it is in the interests of justice that an order be made for a trial by judge alone and that the discretion should be exercised in favour of such a trial (at [17]);

the relevant factors are not capable of exhaustive definition (at [18]);

the weight of individual factors will vary from case to case (at [18]);

weight should be given to the subjective view of an accused (at [26]);

the interests of justice include providing a trial that is likely to be perceived by the wider community as fair and independent (at [26]);

there will be cases where the giving of reasons may favour a judge alone trial (the Commissioner instanced a trial where the verdict depended on a correct comprehension of complex or technical evidence) (at [29]);

adverse pre-trial publicity may be relevant to whether an accused will receive a fair trial, which is a fundamental consideration of the interests of justice (at [34]); and

the length of the trial and the potential burden on jurors (at [37]).

Decisions in Queensland

61In R v Fardon [2010] QCA 317 the Queensland Court of Appeal considered these questions. However, the issue did not need to be resolved, the court deciding, for reasons arising from a consideration of the evidence, that the verdict should be set aside and a verdict of acquittal entered.

62Chesterman JA considered the authorities with respect to ""the interests of justice"" and concluded that it was a phrase ""so general and, indeed, abstract, that it takes on meaning only by consideration of the particular facts relevant to an application for a no jury order"" (at [74]).

63In Fardon the application for a judge alone trial was supported before the primary judge on the basis that the pre-trial publicity may have had a prejudicial effect on the fairness of the accused's trial. The primary judge concluded that she had confidence in the jury's capacity to deliver a true verdict despite the ""corrosive and prejudicial effect of pre-trial publicity."" Chesterman JA then said (at [75]):

""That was a view open to her Honour and not one which, I apprehend, could have been successfully set aside on appeal. Nevertheless the appellant's conviction on an incoherent prosecution case may suggest that on this occasion the confidence was misplaced.""

64Chesterman JA addressed the controversy with respect to whether there was a presumption that a trial should be by jury. His Honour adopted the approach of McKechnie J in TVM, rejecting that of Heenan J in Martinez and Martin CJ in Arthurs, and concluded (at [81]) that:

""A trial on indictment before a judge without a jury is exceptional. An applicant for a no jury order must show why the case comes within the exception. An applicant for such an order, prosecutor or accused, must satisfy the court that it is in the interests of justice that that be the mode of trial. If the Code expressed neutrality and no preference for a trial by a jury the order could be had for the asking. As it is the sections make it clear that there must be an application for a trial without a jury and, in accordance with ordinary principles, demonstrate why such an order is in the interests of justice""

65The reference by his Honour to the Code is a reference to s 604 of the Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) which provides in the relevant circumstances that if an accused enters a plea, other than a plea of guilty, autrofois acquit, autrofois convict or a plea to jurisdiction, the person is ""deemed to have demanded that the issues raised by such plea or pleas shall be tried by a jury, and is entitled to have them tried accordingly.""

66Chesterman JA also considered the issue of whether one mode of trial is ""more 'socially acceptable' than the other"" (at [86]). In respect of that issue his Honour adopted the approach of Martin CJ. However, his Honour took a different view to Martin CJ with respect to the significance of an accused's subjective opinion that a trial before a jury might not be fair. Whereas Martin CJ in Arthurs thought that such a view ""may be entitled to significant weight"", Chesterman JA took the view that ""more significant than an accused's subjective preference for a particular mode of trial are the grounds on which it might be said, objectively viewed, that there is a significant possibility that a trial before a jury might not be fair"" (at [88]).

67The principal judgment in Fardon was that of Muir JA. However, his Honour's consideration of the question of trial by judge alone was more confined than that of Chesterman JA. His Honour identified that critical to the primary judge's finding was her Honour's understanding that the accused would advance a defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact, his defence may therefore have required the application of objective community standards (at [42]). Muir JA commented that the principles relevant when an application is made for a permanent stay provide a more onerous test than the statute provides in relation to an application for trial by judge alone (at [43]). 

68His Honour concluded that with respect to an application for a judge alone trial (at [44]):

""The overriding consideration in the exercise of a discretion under s 615 is whether it is in the interests of justice to make the order.""

69Fardon was followed by the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in R v Kissier [2011] QCA 223. In Kissier the appellant appealed against his conviction on a number of grounds, including that the relevant judge had erred in failing to make a no jury order (at [4]). 

70It was submitted that the pre-trial judge had erred in a number of respects. The first difficulty was said to be a failure to give weight to the appellant's waiver of his right to a jury trial by making an application under s 615 of the Criminal Code (Qld). The argument advanced by the appellant was that in circumstances where an accused elects to waive his or her right to a trial by jury, a no jury order should be granted, except in circumstances where the case involves the application of community standards as set out in s 615(5) of the Criminal Code (the equivalent of s 132(5) of the Criminal Procedure Act (NSW)). 

71In addressing this aspect, Mullins J, with whom the other judges agreed, gave consideration to whether the correct approach to s 615 involves a presumption in favour of trial by jury. Her Honour expressed agreement with the views of Chesterman JA in Fardon and said at [30]: 

""In light of the purpose for which provision for a judge alone trial was introduced into the Code and that the discretion to make a no jury order may be exercised only if the Court considers it is in the interests of justice to do so, I favour the view expressed by Chesterman JA at [81] of Fardon. The process for the determination of the application that is reflected in the terms of s 615 does not require expression of a starting point on the application for a no jury order that both methods of trial are equally valid.""

72However, as the pre-trial judge had refused to make a no jury order and had approached the determination of the application ""without any preconception or presumption about the appropriate mode of trial in a particular case"", Mullins J acknowledged that a conclusion about the correct starting presumption for a no jury application was not strictly necessary for the determination of the case (at [30]).

73Mullins J then considered the weight that should be given to ""waiver"" of the right to trial by jury of the accused. Her Honour said at [31]:

""As a matter of statutory interpretation, the appellant's contention that the making of the application for a no jury order determined the outcome of the application in his favour cannot be sustained."" 

74An application for leave to appeal to the High Court on the ground that Mullins J had incorrectly interpreted s 615 as incorporating a presumption in favour of trial by jury was rejected. Kiefel J indicated that the Court understood that the pre-trial judge had determined the application on considerations of justice and not upon any presumption concerning the appropriate mode of trial: Kissier v The Queen [2012] HCATrans 28. 

Submissions in the present case

75The Crown submitted that in the present case the trial judge had erred by giving undue weight to the respondent's apprehension that jurors may be biased against him. It was submitted that his Honour had failed to give adequate weight to the fact that jurors are selected at random and are drawn from a diverse pool of people in the general community. It was submitted that his Honour should have had regard to the fact that each juror will be invited to be excused if he or she is unable to give impartial consideration to the case. 

76It was further submitted that the Court was required to determine the application by consideration of relevant evidence. It was submitted that there was no evidence to suggest that a jury is likely to be drawn from people who harbour anti-Muslim sentiment. It was submitted that his Honour failed to consider whether the perception of prejudice by the respondent, assuming it could be established, may be fanciful or irrational: Arthurs at [79].

77The Crown further submitted that even if a juror may believe that males who adhere to strict Muslim beliefs may reflect those beliefs in their attitudes towards women, the essential issue in the trial was the respondent's motive in taking hold of the victim and the circumstances in which she came to be injured. This would require an assessment of his actions and those of the victim when the incident occurred. In assessing those circumstances the jury would be directed not to engage in an impermissible line of reasoning to the effect that the respondent must have intended harm to the victim due to his attitudes and beliefs regarding his wife.

78The Crown emphasised that in his interview with police, the respondent indicated that his desire to know where his wife had gone was based on his concern for her, because he loved her and did not want to be worried about where she was. He said he was ""not against her going to the beach."" She had ""a right to go anywhere she likes"" and he could not stop her from seeing her sister. He denied threatening the complainant in the telephone conversation some weeks before the incident. He also denied assaulting her on 22 December 2009, claiming that he took hold of her only because she was becoming agitated and he feared she would fall. He denied any intention to harm the complainant. He also said he had no previous problems with his wife's family, including the complainant, and they came to dinner every Friday night.

79The Crown submitted that where the respondent refers to his objections to the complainant's interference in his marriage in his record of interview, he does not relate this to a particular attitude towards women based on his Muslim faith. Accordingly, it was submitted that there was no evidence in support of his Honour's finding that the respondent's attitude towards the complainant had ""a religious or cultural basis"" which would be relevant to an assessment of whether his apprehension that he may not receive a fair trial by a jury was reasonable. In any event the Crown submitted that antiquated attitudes towards women are not peculiar to conservative Muslims; they are harboured by members of various ethnic and religious backgrounds. It was submitted that the mere fact that an accused has an attitude towards women, even if self-confessed, would not warrant a judge-alone trial and the fact that the respondent is of the Muslim faith does not make it any more appropriate for the matter to be heard by a judge alone.

80The respondent submitted, relying on the decision in Arthurs, that the Court should take into account and give weight to the respondent's preference for a judge-alone trial. It was further submitted (although the submission was not developed) that the fact that reasons are given by a judge in a judge-alone trial is a factor in favour of granting the application. It was further submitted, relying on Markou, that the efficiencies inherent in a judge-alone trial were also a relevant consideration.

81The respondent submitted that there would be significant prejudice flowing from the admitted conduct of the respondent in relation to his wife, which the jury may well use, despite directions from the trial judge, to impermissibly influence their decision. It was submitted that the respondent would be admitting to holding attitudes and beliefs that ordinary members of the community would in all likelihood find abhorrent.

82It was further submitted that the controversy in the trial is confined to the intent of the respondent at the time he took hold of the victim. As this was a confined issue and there was no issue involving community standards (s 132(5)) it was submitted that this was another reason for the judge to order a judge-alone trial.

The task of this Court

83Section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act provides for appeals against interlocutory orders made by a trial judge. Subsection (2) provides an appeal as of right to the Director of Public Prosecutions against ""an interlocutory judgment or order.""

84This Court has previously considered the correct approach to appeals under the section. In DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63 the Court assembled a bench of five judges to consider, inter alia, the approach it should take when asked to review a decision by a trial judge made pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995. Section 97(1)(b) begins with the words ""the court thinks that"", which Spigelman CJ said introduced an element of subjectivity to the decision of the primary judge (at [27]).

85The Chief Justice concluded that this formulation of the primary judge's task was analogous to the various statutory formulations which require a decision maker to be ""satisfied"" of a certain matter. His Honour concluded that this formulation conferred a wide discretion on a trial judge: (at [28]). The word ""consider"" is equivalent to ""satisfied"": (at [29]). The consequence is that a decision of a primary judge that requires him or her to be ""satisfied"" or to ""consider"" will be reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499. As Spigelman CJ explained, the line of authority flowing from Singer v Berghouse (No 2) [1994] HCA 40; (1994) 181 CLR 201 turns on the use of the word ""satisfied"" in the formulation of what may otherwise be a ""jurisdictional question"": (at [33]).

86Section 132(1) provides that an accused person may apply to the court for an order that he or she be tried by a judge alone. Section 132(3) requires the judge to make that order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree. In those circumstances the court has no discretion. If the accused does not agree an order cannot be made (s 132(3)). However, if the prosecutor does not agree ""the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so"" (s 132(3)).

87A decision as to whether or not the trial should be by judge and jury or by judge alone is a decision on a matter of procedure. A decision as to whether there should be separate trials of co-accused is similarly a decision as to a matter of procedure. Accordingly, a high degree of judicial restraint is required of an appellate court when asked to review that decision: (at [55]).

88It follows that the decision of the primary judge is reviewable for error in the exercise of the ""discretion"", which may involve acting on a wrong principle; allowing extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision-maker; mistaking the relevant facts; failing to take into account some material consideration; or having regard to the relevant facts, a miscarriage of the discretion by reason that the decision was unreasonable or plainly unjust: at [78] (Allsop P). These are the principles discussed by Kirby P in Pambula Hospital at 401-402.

Consideration

89Section 132 in its amended form is similar to provisions for a judge-alone trial in legislation in Western Australia and Queensland. However, s 118 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2004 (WA) provides in subsection (3) that, when considering the application, the court may inform itself in any way it thinks fit.

90Section 132 of the New South Wales Act does not contain a similar provision. Accordingly, when considering an application under the section, apart from matters of which the judge may take judicial notice, the court is confined to the evidence placed before it. In the present case the respondent did not give evidence. The submission on his behalf was confined to an assertion that he adhered to conservative Muslim values which would, in the circumstances of the alleged offence, inevitably raise prejudice in the minds of jurors. I shall return to this issue.

91As I have indicated, the primary judge accepted the Crown's submission that an accused person carries the onus of establishing that an order should be made. The Crown criticised his Honour's decision because the primary judge later asked the Crown to indicate any prejudice that the Crown or the community would face if the application were granted. It was submitted that this question and his Honour's later response to the effect that the Crown had not demonstrated prejudice revealed error, because his Honour erroneously assumed that the Crown carried an onus.

92With respect, the submission is misplaced. His Honour did not ask the question in a manner which reversed the onus. Rather he was inviting the Crown to identify from its perspective how the prosecution or community interests should weigh in his Honour's assessment of where the interests of justice lay when considering the application for a judge-alone trial.

93Section 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that an offence must be tried on indictment unless it is an offence permitted or required to be dealt with summarily. The trial will take place in the Supreme Court or the District Court. Section 131 of the Act provides that criminal proceedings in both courts ""are to be tried by a jury, except as otherwise provided by this Part.""

94As Kirby P said of s 89(1) of the Supreme Court Act, but for subs (5) and (7), s 132 of the Act contains no guidance as to the matters which may inform the ""interests of justice"" when an application is made for a judge-alone trial. Subsection (5) does identify the circumstance where a trial may involve a factual issue ""that requires the application of objective community standards"" as being one occasion when it may be appropriate to refuse to make an order. Subsection (7) encourages a judge alone trial where there may be a substantial risk of interference with a juror. Neither subsection (5) or subsection (7) are of direct relevance in the present case.

95The decisions in Western Australia are each of a single judge but for the decision of Commissioner Sleight. The decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal on the relevant sections in Fardon was obiter. The decision in Kissier accepted that the fact that an accused made an application was relevant but not determinative. I agree with that view but accept that I would be obliged to follow it in any event.

96This appeal raises questions of fundamental importance which the divergence of views in previous decisions confirms are not readily resolved. Although s 131 provides for trial by jury ""except as otherwise provided"", I do not think that the section has the effect of creating a ""presumption"" that the trial should be with a jury, thereby casting a burden of proof on an accused person. Although the accused person carries an evidentiary onus the court does not determine where the interests of justice lie by requiring the evidence to rise to a level by which a ""presumption"" of trial by jury is displaced. Each mode of trial has its particular characteristics and, accordingly, depending on all of the circumstances relating to the particular case, the court may conclude that the interests of justice are best served by a judge-alone trial rather than trial by a jury. Of course, absent an application by an accused person, the default position will be that the trial must take place with a jury. And, no doubt, when considering where the interests of justice lie, it will be relevant that where the trial involves an issue which may be informed by community standards or expectations the interests of justice may be best served by utilising a jury of laypeople. Subsection (5) acknowledges this consideration. However, I see no reason why the legislation otherwise requires particular weight to be given to the fact that, absent an application for a judge-alone trial, the trial will be with a jury as opposed to by a judge alone. The question for the court is whether it considers it is in the interests of justice to make the order.

97In Swain, as I have previously identified, Gleeson CJ identified what he referred to as the collateral advantages of trial by jury. Two interests are commonly identified. First, the community has an interest in ensuring that, where relevant to the issues to be tried, serious criminal matters are determined in accordance with current community standards. Subsection (5) expressly acknowledges this matter. Second, the community has an interest in ensuring that there is public confidence in the criminal justice system. The jury, as a means by which the public may participate in the processes of criminal justice, has been accepted as having a role to play in legitimating the operation of the criminal law, thereby enhancing public confidence in the administration of justice. However, it must also be remembered that less than 3 percent of the criminal trials in this State now take place with a jury: (McClellan CJ at CL, ""The future role of the judge - umpire, manager, mediator or service provider"" p 2, 1 December 2011).

98Furthermore as the length of trials grow problems with juror satisfaction with the process have increasingly been reported. New South Wales Attorney-Generals Department, Report of the Trial Efficiency Working Group (2009) at 59-61. Furthermore, as Heydon J recognised, the duty of a judge to give reasons can operate to safeguard the public interest.

99In so far as the origin of a trial by jury was to provide a protection for the accused, in that he or she would be tried by their peers, where the accused applies in accordance with s 132 for a judge-alone trial, it is plain that the accused has, with proper advice, determined that the protection is not required. For this reason the subjective views of an accused and his or her belief that a jury trial may not be fair, as reflected in his or her desire to dispense with a jury, must be a relevant factor: Arthurs at [79]. The protection which trial by jury is assumed to provide to an accused person by requiring a unanimous verdict of lay judges is no longer of relevance. Of course, the position as determined in Brown is otherwise with respect to a Commonwealth offence, where s 80 of the Constitution controls the situation. However it must be remembered that Brown was a decision as to the meaning of s 80 and was not, at least so far as the majority were concerned, determined by where the interests of justice may lie. Rather, their Honours concluded the position was constrained by the words of the Constitution.

100Where an alleged offence involves objective community standards, the Parliament has made plain that it may be preferable, ""in the interests of justice"", that there should be trial by jury. However, where, as in the present case, the trial will not require the application of community standards to resolve any issue, the factors favouring a jury trial are diminished at least by the absence of that factor. 

101However, the decision that the judge is required to make must be founded upon evidence. That evidence may disclose that, notwithstanding that the accused has a concern that he or she may not receive a fair trial, the concern is misplaced. There are conceivably many people in the community who have particular allegiances or who are members of a minority group and who believe that other members of the community would be prejudiced against them. However, whether those fears should be accepted as having the potential to corrupt the fairness of an accused's trial if tried by a jury must be evaluated having regard to all of the relevant circumstances. Those circumstances will include an assessment of whether the accused's apprehension is soundly based.

102The granting of an application on the mere apprehension of prejudice in prospective jurors, not based on evidence or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice (Evidence Act 1995 s 144), is at odds with the assumption which the common law makes that jurors will understand and obey the instructions of trial judges to bring an impartial mind to bear on their verdict: Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [13] (Gleeson CJ and Gummow J). The fact that an accused person desires a trial by judge alone, although relevant, is not as significant as the reasons for that preference and whether those reasons are rationally justified and bear upon whether he or she will receive a fair trial.

103Although the foundation for a decision to order a judge-alone trial under s 132 is that it be in the ""interests of justice."" I understand that concept in similar terms to the approach which Kirby P took in resolving the issues in Pambula Hospital. The court must determine whether it is in the interests of justice in the particular case to provide for a judge-alone trial.

104In the present case, although the primary judge had before him the records of interview of the respondent and the statements from his wife and the complainant, his Honour did not have evidence before him to allow an evaluation of whether the respondent's concerns had substance. The respondent's position was confined to a submission by his counsel that he feared that a jury may be prejudiced against him because of his conservative Muslim beliefs. 

105It may be inferred from the primary judge's reasons that his Honour accepted that the subjective views of an accused person that he may not get a fair trial if tried by a jury are relevant when considering an application. Of course, in every case the inspiration for the application will be the accused's perception as to the likely fairness of a trial by jury in his or her particular circumstances.

106In Arthurs there was evidence before the court of the burden of pre-trial publicity which the accused had been required to endure. Although Martin CJ said that it would have been preferable for there to be evidence of Arthurs' subjective views before they could be considered, it was not difficult to identify them and reach the conclusion that he might rationally fear whether he would receive a fair trial. The position is different in the present case.

107It may be accepted that from time to time adverse publicity is given to events which have occurred, generally outside Australia, where the strict application of a form of Muslim law or Islamic tradition has given rise to the treatment of a woman or women in a manner which is generally unacceptable to ordinary Australians. It may also be that some people in the Australian community harbour prejudice against persons who adhere to the Muslim faith, particularly against those holding ""conservative"" views about the place and role of women in marriage or in wider society. However, without evidence that such views are widespread in the Australian community and would be likely to influence jurors, it must be assumed that the protection afforded an accused person in the ordinary course of a trial will protect him or her from an unjust result. Those protections include the practice that before jurors are selected, each member of the panel will be reminded of their obligation to bring an impartial mind to the decision, and after being informed of the alleged offence, the identity of the accused, and the nature of the issues in the trial, asked to consider whether they can fairly consider the relevant issues. In the present case the jury would be told that the accused is a Muslim and that an issue in the trial is whether his actions in respect of his wife's sister were motivated by his attitude to the role of women in marriage. There will of course be extra protection afforded to the appellant by the trial judge's directions to the jury, which will remind them that they must decide the case having regard to the evidence and be careful not to let any prejudice they may have influence the decision. The jury may conclude that the respondent acted as he did because of his strict Muslim views, but this would be a conclusion founded upon the evidence and not resulting from any prejudice against Muslim people. The respondent's conservative views in relation to women may be an important element in the Crown case, but not because of any inherent prejudice in the community against persons who hold those views. 

108The primary judge did not approach the issue in this manner. There was no evidence of the existence in the community of the prejudice which was asserted. His Honour did not consider whether, if such a prejudice exists, it could be neutralised or removed by the directions of the trial judge. Although I recognise the caution which this Court must take when asked to reconsider the decision of a trial judge made under s 132, I am satisfied that in the present case the decision which his Honour made was not open. His Honour did not have evidence to allow him to make the finding which he did. Furthermore, his Honour did not consider whether by following the conventional procedures for trial by jury the prejudice which the respondent feared could be avoided. For these reasons the appeal must be upheld and the decision of the primary judge quashed.

109The present case is the first occasion on which s 132 has been considered by this Court. The issues which have been raised in this appeal extended beyond matters considered by the primary judge. Two matters of particular significance should be discussed.

110In some cases the decision of a judge to order trial by judge alone has been influenced by consideration of the efficiencies available from a judge-alone trial and the advantage available to an accused person and the community if reasons for the verdict are available from the trial judge: Markou at [6]-[8]; Arthurs at [76], [92]; see also Rayney at [29], [37]. For my part I would accept that as part of the mix of issues which must be considered the likely length of the trial in a particular case, if conducted with a jury, compared with the likely length of trial by a judge alone, is relevant. The likely length of a trial may have to do with the complexity of the issues involved, the number of accused to be tried, or the number of witnesses to be called. The obligation on prospective jurors to spend many months away from their normal activities, including their employment with extremely modest monetary recompense, may be a significant matter in a particular case when determining where the interests of justice lie. Trial judges are familiar with the problems which can arise with jurors who become frustrated at their continuing involvement in a trial weeks or months after the original estimate has passed with the obvious diminishing contribution they make to understanding the evidence and the issues which require resolution.

111However, I would not accept that the interests of justice in s 132 can be informed by considerations of the overall efficiencies in the operation of a court which may be available from a judge-alone trial. No doubt they are important issues for the administration of justice and may ultimately lead to further legislative intervention but, as the majority determined in Pambula Hospital, they are not relevant to the interests of justice in the particular case.

112As the reasons of Martin CJ in Arthurs make plain, the Chief Justice considered the requirement for a judge to give reasons to be a significant factor when considering where the interests of justice lie. To my mind the opportunity which a reasoned judgment affords to the accused and to the public to understand the steps in the reasoning process of the decision-maker, compared with the inscrutability of the jury's decision, will depending upon all the circumstances, be a factor which is relevant to the decision as to whether to order a judge-alone trial. However, it is but one factor and the weight to be given to it will depend upon the nature of the issues to be determined in the trial. If the trial will involve complex engineering, scientific or medical issues it may be more readily concluded that a verdict accompanied by the reasons of the trial judge will enhance the interests of justice, both in relation to the accused and the maintenance of confidence in the criminal justice system. It would inevitably facilitate an appeal if the trial judge has erred.

113As Martin CJ remarked in Arthurs, the recent trend in many areas has been to require a decision-maker to provide reasons for his or her decision. The giving of reasons requires the decision maker to consider the evidence, follow accepted methods of reasoning, and express the reasons for the decision in a manner which can be understood and analysed by others. If accepted to be sound, published reasons must serve to enhance confidence in the process of the law. If not sound, they can be challenged and, where relevant error is identified, the decision can be corrected.

114Whether a jury has correctly understood the facts and correctly applied the law can never be authoritatively determined. However, it must be remembered that the jury's verdict is a ""community decision."" The jury has a right to bring in a perverse verdict and acquit an accused: Bushell's Case (1670) 124 ER 1006; R v Shipley (1784) 4 Doug 73, 170; Chandler v DPP [1964] AC 763 at 804. Whether that right is compatible with contemporary notions of justice, balancing the interests of an accused and the State, and whether it is still generally accepted by the community, is of course unknown. However, any accused person who believes that right of a jury may be to their advantage is unlikely to apply for a judge-alone trial. Notwithstanding the significance of these issues, as I have discussed, the decision in this case does not turn upon them.

Orders

115In my judgment the appeal should be upheld and the decision of the primary judge quashed.

116HIDDEN J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL. I agree that the primary judge fell into error in his approach to the application for the reasons identified by the Chief Judge, and I agree with the order proposed. 

117I also appreciate the Chief Judge's examination of the wider issues raised by the question whether a trial should be by jury or by judge alone, and his examination of authority bearing on those issues. Generally, however, I would prefer to express no concluded view about those matters because it is unnecessary to do so to resolve the present case. 

118This much I would say. I think it is unhelpful to speak about a presumption or an onus when an application is made by an accused for trial by judge alone. The statutory scheme created by ss 131 and 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act is that a trial on indictment is normally by jury, and it is for the accused to raise material which might lead to the conclusion that it is in the interests of justice to depart from that mode of trial. It is then a matter for the judge to determine where the interests of justice lie in all the circumstances of the case, and the approach of the parties to the matter should not be adversarial. While the history of trial by jury suggests that the institution has been for the protection of the accused, it is clear that s 132(4) recognises that there is a community interest in trial by jury which in a particular case might override the accused's preference for a judge alone trial. So much is spelt out in subs (5). To adopt the words of Chesterman JA in Fardon, an accused cannot have a trial by judge alone ""for the asking"". 

119On the issue of reasons for a verdict as a factor bearing upon the choice of the mode of trial, I share the view of McKechnie J in TVM expressed in the passage from his judgment quoted at [55] of the reasons of the Chief Judge. The fact that there is now provision in New South Wales for majority verdicts (allowing for only one dissenting juror) does not reduce the force of his Honour's observations. 

120The perceived desirability of reasons for a verdict and the efficiency of the conduct of a criminal trial may well be matters of policy which the Legislature would consider if it were examining whether jury trials should be abolished or modified. However, as the law stands, I can see little or no place for either consideration in determining the appropriate mode of trial, but I would prefer to express no concluded view about the matter.

121HISLOP J: I too have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL. I agree that the primary judge fell into error in his approach to the application for the reasons identified by the Chief Judge, and I agree with the order proposed. 

122I also appreciate the Chief Judge's examination of the wider issues raised by the question whether a trial should be by jury or by judge alone, and his examination of authority bearing on those issues. However, I would prefer to express no concluded view about those matters as it is unnecessary to do so to resolve the present case.

		09 May 2012",2012-05-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2416836,New South Wales Crime Commission v Jason LEE [2012] NSWSC 437,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  The first defendant in these proceedings, Jason Lee, is the father of the fourth defendant, Seong Lee. I shall refer to them as Jason and Seong. The third defendant, J & Lee Property Investment Group Pty Limited, has been referred to as a family company. It was incorporated in April 2008. Seong is, and always has been, a director of the company and is the majority shareholder. Jason was a director for a period between May and June 2009 and, apparently, is the CEO of the company.
2On 16 March 2011, after a trial in the District Court, Jason was convicted of two counts of supplying a large commercial quantity of pseudo- ephedrine, and a firearms charge. Seong was convicted of knowingly taking part in the supply of the drug, together with four firearms charges. The allegation of supply was founded upon their possession of that quantity of the drug, engaging the deeming provision in s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The drug was found on 7 December 2009 in a home unit in Lachlan Street, Waterloo, a property which had been acquired by the family company in August 2008. As I understand it, there were two counts of supplying the drug because quantities of it were found in different locations within the premises. 
3In all, there were some 44 kilograms of the drug (as an admixture), said to have a street value in excess of $2,000,000. Over a million dollars in cash was also found in the main bedroom of the unit. 
4On 12 May 2010, the plaintiff, New South Wales Crime Commission, obtained a restraining order, pursuant to s 10A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990, in respect of the interests in property of Jason. Among other things, that order applies to Jason's interests in the property of the company. It also extends to his interest in a property at Chifley, registered in Seong's name. In addition, the order applies to the interest of a woman named Elizabeth Park in a unit at Waterloo. Ms Park is the second defendant, and I shall explain her connection with this matter later. 
5Both Jason and Seong have appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against their convictions. In addition, Seong is yet to face trial in the District Court upon a charge of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime. Before me is a motion by them for a variation of the restraining order to permit payment of their reasonable legal expenses for those proceedings. The application is made pursuant to s 10B(3)(b) of the Act, by which a restraining order may provide for meeting out of the restrained property ""reasonable legal expenses of any person whose interests in property are subject to the restraining order.... incurred in defending a criminal charge.""
6By s 16A (1)(e), any such provision must specify the particular interest in property out of which the expenses concerned may be met. The property specified in the present case is a bank cheque in favour of the company in the amount of $100,000, and funds amounting to a little over  $200,000 held in an ANZ bank account in the name of the company. 
7Section 10B(3)(b) is expressed to be subject to s 16A. By s 16A(1)(b), no provision for legal expenses is to be made ""in relation to any particular interest in property if the Supreme Court is satisfied that the interest is illegally acquired property."" The expression ""illegally acquired property"" is broadly defined in s 9(1), and includes property which was wholly or partly acquired using illegally acquired property: s 9(1)(c). In s 4(1), ""illegal activity"" is also broadly defined, so as to embrace any offence against the laws of New South Wales or the Commonwealth. 
8The Crime Commission opposes the order sought on three bases:
The property from which provision for legal expenses is sought was illegally acquired.
The legal expenses sought to pursue the appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal are not expenses ""incurred in defending a criminal charge"", within the meaning of s 10B(3)(b).
Seong has no entitlement to such an order because he is not a ""person whose interests in property are subject to the restraining order"", within the meaning of that same provision.
Defending a criminal charge
9It is convenient to deal immediately with the second point. Senior Counsel for the Commission, Mr Temby QC, submitted that the provision in s10B(3)(b) for meeting out of restrained property expenses ""incurred in defending a criminal charge"" does not embrace the expenses of an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. He argued that an appeal is separate and distinct from the defence of a criminal charge, which embraces trial and sentence. As he put it in oral argument, an appeal is ""not a defence to the charge, but rather a challenge to the verdict on conviction which is entered.""
10No authority for this proposition was cited. Mr Sutherland SC, who appeared with Mr Clark for the two defendants, referred me to a passage in the judgment of Kirby P in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Saxon (1990) 28 NSWLR 263, at 268 - 269. That case was concerned with the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth), in which provision was also made for meeting out of restrained property a person's ""reasonable expenses in defending a criminal charge"": s 43(3). The President saw the expression as one of wide import, noting that applications for bail and representation in committal proceedings had been held to fall within it. Whether it extended to an appeal after conviction was not a matter which needed to be considered in that case.  
11I cannot accept Mr Temby's submission. I see the appeal process as an integral part of the criminal justice system. An accused person might contend on appeal that the verdict is unreasonable and that he or she should be acquitted, or that the trial process was affected by error and there should be a new trial. In either event, the accused seeks to demonstrate that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The criminal proceedings against the accused remain on foot until the appeal is determined and, indeed, they continue thereafter if a new trial is ordered. The whole of this process should properly be seen as part of the defence of the criminal charge in question and, accordingly, is susceptible to provision for legal reasonable expenses under s 10B(3)(d).
Illegally acquired property
12The principal area of contention is whether the property from which provision for legal expenses is sought was illegally acquired. Before turning to the provenance of that property, it is necessary to sketch the dealings with other property of the two defendants and the company. The evidence of these dealings is not challenged, but there is a dispute as to the inferences to be drawn from it. 
13As I have said, among the interests in property of Jason the subject of the restraining order are his interests in the property of the company. This includes ten properties in and around Sydney purchased by the company between May 2008 and December 2009. It also includes some motor vehicles, a matter to which I shall return. In addition, it will be remembered that Ms Elizabeth Park's interest in a home unit at Waterloo is the subject of the order, as is Jason's interest in a property at Chifley in the name of Seong.
14It is convenient at this point to bring into the picture Mr Brendon Pak, an associate of Jason and Seong. In an affidavit he discloses that during 2008 and 2009 he operated a number of bank accounts with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). On a number of occasions over that period, he deposes, Jason provided him with cash, saying that he needed to buy a bank cheque for the company. Mr Pak would deposit the cash into one of his accounts, and soon thereafter would purchase a bank cheque made out to the company.  He would hand those cheques to Jason or Seong.  As I understand it, Ms Park is Mr Pak's partner.  
Real estate
15Information about the ten properties purchased by the company, and the properties purchased in the name of Ms Park and Seong, is to be found in an affidavit of Jonathon Lee Spark, the Director of Financial Investigations with the Commission, together with the source documents which are an exhibit to that affidavit. For present purposes, it is not necessary to examine this evidence in detail. What it discloses is that all but one of the properties acquired by the company were purchased without the assistance of mortgage funds. For one of them, a property at Cabarita, both the deposit and the balance of the purchase price were paid overseas. For another, a unit in Liverpool Street, Sydney, the deposit was paid in cash but the balance of the price was paid overseas. A property at St Leonards was paid for substantially, if not wholly, in cash supplied to the vendor by Jason. For a property at Vineyard, more than half the purchase price was paid in cash to the vendor by Jason and the balance by company cheques. 
16The property which the company bought with mortgage funds was a unit in Castlereagh Street, Sydney. The remaining properties acquired by the company were paid for mainly by bank cheques purchased by it, on quite a few occasions with cash. As to the unit in Waterloo in the name of Elizabeth Park, the whole of the purchase price less the deposit was paid by bank cheques drawn from the company's account. The property at Chifley in the name of Seong was financed substantially by mortgage funds. 
17The purchase price of all twelve properties totalled a little over $13.8 million. Of that amount, a little over $1.7 million is established as having been paid in cash. Amounts raised on mortgage totalled about $3.2 million, leaving an amount of roughly $10.6 million paid without the assistance of mortgage funds.   
Motor vehicles
18Evidence of the acquisition of three expensive cars by the company, now subject to the restraining order, is to be found in Mr Spark's affidavit and the transcript of evidence given to the Commission by Mr Sid Khoury. At the relevant time Mr Khoury was a motor dealer. In 2008, he was introduced to Jason by Mr Pak. Between August and November 2008, on behalf of the company, Jason bought from him a BMW, a Hummer and a Bentley. They were paid for in cash, in amounts totalling $585,800. 
19In addition, on two occasions Jason lent money to Mr Khoury in amounts totalling $1,000.000. These were also paid in cash. By a series of cheques made out to the company between November 2008 and February 2009, Mr Khoury repaid amounts totalling about $780,000. At the time he gave his evidence to the Commission, in May 2010, the balance was outstanding. 
20Accordingly, through 2008 and 2009 Jason and Seong, personally or through the company, were dealing in very large amounts of cash. To the amounts involved in purchasing the properties and the vehicles, and the substantial loans from Jason to Mr Khoury, there should be added the amount of roughly $1.2 million in cash found at the Waterloo unit when the pseudo- ephedrine was discovered. Neither Jason nor Seong has provided any evidence about the source of this money. Nor is there any evidence of their income during the relevant period. Jason had not lodged tax returns for the financial years ending 30 June 2003 to 30 June 2010. Seong was not required to lodge tax returns for the financial years 2000 to 2005, did not lodge returns for the financial years ending 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2008, and did not have a taxable income for the financial year ending 30 June 2007. The company had not lodged tax returns for the financial years ending 30 June 2003 to 30 June 2010.
Bank Cheque/company account
21I turn, then, to the property from which Jason and Seong seek provision for their legal expenses: the bank cheque in favour of the company for $100,000 and the funds of roughly $200,000 in the company's account with the ANZ Bank. On the question of the bank cheque the evidence of Mr Pak is important. Although his affidavit has been read without his having been required for cross-examination, his credibility is challenged.
22Mr Pak gave evidence at the trial of Jason and Seong. By agreement I was supplied with extracts from the transcript of his cross-examination at the trial. I was not told what the overall effect of his evidence was, and it does not appear from the extracts that I have that he was being cross-examined about the matter with which I am concerned. Nevertheless, the transcript discloses that he admitted having lied in evidence at the trial and in earlier evidence to the Crime Commission, and that he acknowledged himself to be a liar, a perjurer, a welfare cheat, a tax cheat and a fraudster. 
23The bank cheque was found on 22 June 2010 during a search of the company's unit at Liverpool Street, Sydney. It is a Commonwealth Bank cheque, drawn on 23 October 2008. An affidavit of Grant Austen, an officer of CBA, establishes that it was purchased by Mr Pak, drawn from one of his accounts at the Bank. The same affidavit discloses that in that same month and the following month four further bank cheques were drawn in favour of the company from funds in the same account of Mr Pak: for $150,000 on 27 October, $100,000 on 28 October, $150,000 on 3 November and $100,000 on 19 November. In all, bank cheques totalling $600,000 were drawn in favour of the company between 23 October and 19 November 2008. 
24The evidence of Mr Pak is that these bank cheques were part of the pattern to which I have referred earlier, whereby Jason would provide cash to Mr Pak and ask him to draw bank cheques in favour of the company. This is supported by the CBA records provided by Mr Austen. 
25Bank statements for Mr Pak's account disclose a series of cash deposits between May and October 2008, the amounts totalling in excess of $900,000. Some of the deposits are for small amounts, which do not appear to be significant. Most of them, however, are substantial, being five or six figure amounts. More importantly, in October 2008 several of the deposits precede the drawing of bank cheques to the company, producing a balance in the account sufficient to fund the cheque.
26On 23 October, the day the subject bank cheque for $100,000 was drawn, there was a cash deposit of $140,000. On 24 October there was a deposit of nearly $150,000, and on 27 October a bank cheque in the same amount was drawn. On 27 October there was another cash deposit of $100,000 and, again, a bank cheque for that same amount was drawn on 28 October. On 29 and 30 October there were deposits of $100,000 and $130,000 respectively. Thereafter bank cheques were drawn on 3 November for $150,000 and on 19 November for $100,000. 
27These transactions are consistent with Mr Pak's account of his dealings with Jason. In particular, they confirm that the subject bank cheque of 23 October was funded by cash provided by Jason. Notwithstanding his lack of credibility acknowledged in cross-examination at the trial, I accept Mr Pak's evidence about this matter. 
28Also read was an affidavit of Harsha Maligaspe, an officer of the ANZ Bank, to which are exhibited records of the company's account with that bank. It is sufficient to say that the records disclose cash deposits totalling $995,000 between 23 October and 4 November 2009. This, of course, is proximate in time to the search of the Waterloo unit on 7 December 2009 in which the drug was found.
29Again, Jason and Seong have put on no evidence to explain these large cash deposits or the bank cheques drawn from Mr Pak's account. An affidavit of Lyndall Foldvary, a personal assistant to the defendants' solicitor, was read, to which are annexed statements for the company account for the first half of 2011. They disclose regular payments from a real estate agent for rent on two of the company's properties, at Redfern and St Leonards, the subject of the restraining order. This, of course, says nothing about the period to the end of 2009. I understand it to be directed to the legitimacy of the funds currently in that account, a matter to which I shall return. 
30In the light of all this evidence, unexplained as it is, Mr Temby argued that I would be satisfied that the bank cheque of 23 October and the funds in the company's account are wholly or partly the product of illegal activity. He pointed out that it is not necessary to prove exactly what the illegal activity was or by whom it was perpetrated. However, he contended that I would readily conclude that the source of those items of property was drug dealing, money laundering or both. From the quantity of drug found at the Waterloo unit and the defendants' access to very large amounts of cash between mid-2008 and the end of 2009, he said, I would conclude that they had been involved in drug dealing on a large scale. He observed that drug dealing of that order is highly remunerative and those involved in it normally deal in cash. A variety of means might then be employed to launder that money. In particular in the present case, he suggested, the process whereby Jason provided cash to Mr Pak in return for bank cheques in favour of the company has all the hallmarks of a laundering exercise.
31Mr Temby argued that all twelve properties to which I have referred, together with the three motor vehicles, were purchased at least in part with money acquired illegally. The same is true, he argued, of the cash from which the bank cheques were sourced and the substantial amount of cash deposited into the company's account late in 2009. As to that account, he acknowledged that the bank statements annexed to Ms Foldvary's affidavit disclose legitimate deposits in 2011. Nevertheless, he argued, the amount of money which has gone into that account since 7 December 2009 is far less than would enable one to categorise the account as ""clean sourced."" As he put it in oral argument, there must be ""an awful lot of that $995,000 which is still in there."" That being so, he said, the balance of the account has been partly acquired using illegally acquired property, within the meaning of s 9(1)(c) of the Act.   
32Mr Temby referred me to the decision of Sperling J in NSW Crime Commission v OB & Anor [2002] NSWSC 633. That was also an application for provision out of restrained property of reasonable legal expenses. The facts of the case were significantly different from the present case, but it did involve a number of deposits into a bank account. Sperling J referred at [6] to s 9(1)(c), observing that the effect of that provision was that ""in the case of a bank account, if illegally obtained money has been contributed to the fund, the whole of it constitutes illegally acquired property."" At [20], his Honour noted that leave had previously been granted to the applicant to amend the notice of motion so as to claim separately in relation to each deposit. He declined to take that approach, saying that in view of the provisions of s 9, ""the amendment does not allow the bank account to be treated in such a segmented way.""
33In that case the applicant was charged with supplying drugs but had not yet come to trial. However, there was evidence before Sperling J of his being involved in supplying drugs at a house. The applicant proffered an innocent explanation for this evidence, which his Honour rejected. He found that money deposited into the account was the product of that drug dealing. He expressed his conclusion in this way at [61]:
""On the evidence, the enterprise carried on at the house was likely to have been highly remunerative. The applicant had no other means of accumulating a large sum of money. Absent explanation, I would infer that the money in the bank account came from the illicit drug dealing enterprise in which the applicant was involved.""  
Alone for the obvious differences between that case and this, Mr Temby submitted that a similar inference should be drawn here.
34For the defendants, Mr Sutherland submitted that I would not be satisfied that the bank cheque and the balance of the company's account were illegally acquired, even in part. He emphasised that the conviction of the defendants rested upon their possession of the drug and the deeming provision, and argued that that was an insecure foundation for a conclusion that they were drug dealers. He contrasted the present case from OB, in which there was direct evidence that the applicant was involved in drug dealing.
35As to the properties, he noted that two of them were paid for, either wholly or in large part, overseas and there is no evidence as to the source of those funds. The purchase of two others was funded to a substantial extent by mortgage loans. He observed that some people choose to carry out transactions with cash, postulating that this was particularly true of people of Asian extraction.  As to the bank cheques, of course, he placed emphasis on Mr Pak's admitted lack of credibility.
36Mr Sutherland referred to Saxon (supra), in which an order for the provision of legal expenses from restrained property was upheld on appeal. Among other things, the Director of Public Prosecutions had contended that the restrained assets were tainted by his criminal activities, an inference which might have been available on the evidence in that case. Kirby P, with whom Mahoney and Priestley JJA agreed, said at [274]:
""The case is not analogous to the bank robber caught red-handed with the funds of others. It is, ostensibly, Mr Saxon's own property which is restrained by the orders made under the Act. How he accumulated that property may be a matter for speculation. Doubtless it may be the subject of evidence and argument as his criminal proceedings unfold.  But be he should not be deprived of the use of his property for the proper defence of those proceedings unless the Act obliges such a course.""
37By way of contrast, Mr Sutherland also cited NSW Crime Commission v Younan & Anor (1993) 31 NSWLR 44. It is unnecessary to examine the facts of that case. It is sufficient to say that the Court of Appeal set aside an order for the provision of legal expenses from restrained bank accounts of the respondents.  The primary judge had made that finding even though there was ""almost overwhelming evidence"" that the source of the money in those accounts was the very money the subject of the criminal activity with which they were charged.  
38Those cases, of course, turned on their own facts (as, of course, did OB).  Moreover, in both cases evidence that the property from which provision for expenses was sought was tainted by illegality was a matter bearing upon the discretion whether to make that order. The legislation with which the Court was dealing in each case did not have an equivalent of s 16A, which leaves this Court with no choice but to refuse the order if it is satisfied that any part of the relevant property was illegally acquired. 
39I have carefully considered the competing arguments of counsel, aware of the potential significance of the decision I have to make. The importance of legal representation in serious criminal proceedings is the subject of abundant authority, which it is unnecessary to recite. Kirby P addressed that issue in Saxon at 268 and again at 273-274. Legal aid may well be available in this case, but at 273-274 the President referred to American authority and to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, each speaking of the right of a person to legal representation of his or her own choosing.
40The Commission bears the civil onus of proof, applying the Briginshaw test: OB at [59]. That onus has been discharged. For the reasons advanced by Mr Temby, I am driven to the conclusion that the bank cheque and the funds in the company's account are, at least in part, illegally acquired property. That is the only finding required to dispose of the motion before me. Evidence of the large sums of cash used for the purchase of the properties and the motor vehicles is relevant to that decision, but it is neither necessary nor appropriate for me to express a conclusion whether all of that property was also illegally acquired.  Closer examination of the acquisition of some part of that property may show that it is available to raise funds for legal expenses without falling foul of s.16A.  If such an application were made, it would fall to be determined on the evidence then presented.
Seong's application
41Mr Temby's arguments focused on Jason's application for provision for legal expenses.  As I have said, he submitted that Seong has no standing to make such an application because no interest of property of his is affected by the restraining order.  That proposition may not be as simple as it sounds.  Mr Sutherland submitted that, although the restraining order is confined to the interests in property of Jason (and Ms Park), it could have the effect of preventing Seong from dealing with his own propriety interests.  He referred, in particular, to Seong's interest as registered proprietor of the property at Chifley.
42However, as Mr Temby foreshadowed in argument, this is a matter I do not have to decide given my conclusion that the property from which provision is sought was illegally acquired.  I would prefer to express no concluded view about it. 
Order
43The motion is dismissed.  If necessary, I shall hear the parties on costs.

		10 August 2012",2012-05-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2416889,R v PCB [2012] NSWSC 482,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: At the commencement of his trial on 3 May 2012, the Accused, PCB, pleaded not guilty to each of the following charges contained in an indictment:

(a)Count 1: On 9 October 2010 at Liverpool he murdered C (s.18(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900);

(b)Count 2: On 9 October 2010 at Liverpool he wounded Jazued Ahmed with intent to murder (s.27 Crimes Act 1900);

(c)Count 3: On 9 October 2010 at Liverpool he wounded Rajesh Ram with intent to murder (s.27 Crimes Act 1900);

(d)Count 4: In the alternative to Count 3, on 9 October 2010 at Liverpool he wounded Rajesh Ram with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (s.33(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900);

(e)Count 5: On 9 October 2010 at Liverpool he possessed an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely assault Constable Robert Soprenic, a police officer, in the execution of his duty (s.33B(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900).

2C, the victim in Count 1, was the 12-year old son of the Accused. As a result, the name of C must not be published or broadcast, nor may a reference to any information, picture or other material be published or broadcast that identifies C, or is likely to lead to the identification of C: s.15A(1) and (4) Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. Both the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the Accused proposed that the best way to ensure compliance with the terms of s.15A was to use initials for the names of the deceased child, his mother and the Accused. I have adopted that approach.

Trial by Judge Alone

3On 21 March 2012, the Accused signed a form of election under s.132(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 electing to be tried by a judge alone. He stated that, before making that election, he had sought and received advice in relation to the election from Sashi Shukla, solicitor. An affidavit of Sashi Shukla sworn 28 March 2012 evidences that the Accused was given appropriate advice concerning the relevant election. Accordingly, I am satisfied that, before making the election, the Accused obtained advice in relation to the election from an Australian legal practitioner: s.132(1)(b) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

4On 21 March 2012, the Director of Public Prosecutions consented to the trial of the Accused proceeding before a judge alone.

5Where both the Accused and the Crown agree to a trial by judge alone, the Court must proceed in that way: s.132(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

6Section 133 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that a judge trying a criminal proceeding without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of guilt. The judgment of the Court in such a case must include the principles of law applied by the judge and the findings of fact on which the judge relies. 

Issues at the Trial of the Accused

7At the commencement of the trial, Mr Winch, counsel for the Accused, informed the Court that the sole issue in the trial concerned the defence of mental illness.

8By consent, the Crown tendered the following documents:

(a)an Agreed Statement of Facts (Exhibit A);

(b)an edited transcript of an electronically recorded interview (ERISP) between Detective Sergeant Paul Smith and the Accused at the Liverpool Police Station on 10 October 2010 (Exhibit B);

(c)a report of Dr Rosalie Wilcox, general and forensic psychiatrist, dated 8 October 2011 (Exhibit C).

9Dr Wilcox gave oral evidence in the Crown case.
 
10By consent, Mr Winch tendered the following documents:

(a)a report of Dr Scott Clark, consultant forensic psychiatrist, with Justice Health, dated 18 November 2010 (Exhibit 1);

(b)a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 14 June 2011 (Exhibit 2);

(c)a report of Dr Akram Bangash of the Liverpool Family Medical Centre, dated 14 June 2011 (Exhibit 3).

11Dr Nielssen gave oral evidence in the case for the Accused. 

Elements of the Offences

12The burden of proof lies on the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt the elements of each of the offences with which the Accused stands charged. 

13With respect to the charge of murder (Count 1), the Crown must prove that:

(a)C died as a result of injuries;

(b)the injuries were inflicted by the deliberate act of the Accused; and

(c)at the time of doing the act, it was the intention of the Accused to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm to C.

14Mr Winch submitted that the Court ought readily be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of these elements had been established in this case, with the evidence establishing, to the requisite standard, that the Accused had an intention to kill C when he caused the fatal injuries to him. 

15With respect to each of the charges of wounding with intent to murder (Counts 2 and 3), the Crown must prove that:

(a)the Accused wounded each of Mr Ahmed and Mr Ram; and

(b)at the time of wounding each victim, the Accused intended to kill the victim.

16Once again, Mr Winch submitted that the Court ought readily be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that each of these elements had been established in this case, with the Accused intending to kill each victim at the time when he wounded that victim. 

17With respect to Count 4, which only arises if the Accused is acquitted on Count 3, the Crown must prove that:

(a)the Accused wounded Mr Ram;

(b)at the time of wounding Mr Ram, the Accused intended to cause grievous bodily harm.

18If the Accused is acquitted on Count 3, it will be necessary to return a verdict on Count 4. In the context of this trial, if the Accused is acquitted on Count 3 by reason of mental illness, then a verdict on Court 4 will be required, with the sole issue again being the defence of mental illness.
 
19With respect to Count 5, the elements which the Crown must prove are that:

(a)the Accused possessed an offensive weapon (a knife);

(b)at that time, the Accused intended to commit an indictable offence, namely to assault Constable Soprenic, a police officer, in the execution of his duty.

20Once again, Mr Winch accepts that the evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt each of the elements of this offence, so that the Accused would be liable to conviction on this count, subject to the defence of mental illness.

21It remains necessary for me to make findings of fact before moving to the defence of mental illness.

Findings of Fact

22What follows is taken from the Agreed Statement of Facts.

23The Accused was born in July 1980. At the time of these events, he was aged 30 years. As will be seen, the Accused has a long history of mental illness.

24The deceased, C, was 12 years' old in October 2010. C was the son of L and the Accused. 

25L and the Accused had been in a long-term ""on and off"" relationship. They had known each other since primary school. At the time when C was born, L was 17 years' old and the Accused was 18 years' old. 

26L informed police that her relationship with the Accused had ended before 2007 and that, from 2007, she was in a relationship with another man, A. Although the relationship between L and the Accused had ended, L would allow the Accused to stay, from time to time, at her Liverpool unit. 

27In May 2010, L ""kicked"" the Accused out of the unit. However, for about five-to-six weeks leading up to 9 October 2010, the Accused was once again living at the unit. 

28On the morning of Saturday, 9 October 2010, L took C and a seven-year old girl to visit A at Parklea Correctional Centre. In the early afternoon, they returned to the unit. C was tired and lay on his bed watching a DVD movie. C later told L that he was going to have a sleep. 

29Shortly afterwards, L and the seven-year old girl left the unit to go to the shops. They met a friend of L. Thereafter, L returned briefly to the unit to get some money, which she had forgotten. She checked on C and found he was asleep. She took the money and went downstairs and spoke to the Accused. They spoke briefly about what they might have for dinner. L then left the unit, returning between 6.00 pm - 6.30 pm that evening, when she observed police at the scene.

30Between 3.00 pm and 5.00 pm on 9 October 2010, the Accused and C were alone in the unit. During this period, the Accused obtained a knife and stabbed C a number of times to the neck and chest. It appears that C was sleeping in his bed at the time of the initial stabbing.

31C suffered multiple stab wounds. One stab wound extended through the right lung and then to the right atrium of the heart. Another stab wound extended into the area of the third and fourth cervical vertebrae and resulted in a total transection of the upper cervical spinal cord. Dr Van Vuure, forensic pathologist, found that the cause of death was multiple stab wounds.

32Shortly after the fatal attack upon C, the Accused left the unit, still possessing the knife. Under the guise of looking for a pet cat, he approached Jazued Ahmed for help. Mr Ahmed was 26 years of age and lived at the unit complex. They both walked a short distance, when the Accused turned around and stabbed Mr Ahmed with the knife to the arm and chest. Mr Ahmed commenced to run away. 

33The Accused chased after him. Mr Ahmed ran towards another man, Rajesh Ram, who had witnessed the Accused stabbing Mr Ahmed. Mr Ram, aged 49 years, was visiting relatives who lived in the block of units.

34When the Accused got close to Mr Ram, he stabbed Mr Ram in the chest with the knife. The Accused and Mr Ram then struggled with the knife and the Accused ran off towards L's unit.

35The police were called and arrived shortly afterwards at the unit block. Constable Soprenic saw the Accused outside L's unit. At the time, the Accused was armed with the knife which was concealed. The Accused approached Constable Soprenic who told the Accused to ""step back"". The Accused then produced the knife. In response, Constable Soprenic commenced to remove his firearm from its holster. The Accused then threw the knife on the ground and the Accused was taken into custody.

36Both Mr Ahmed and Mr Ram were treated at Liverpool Hospital for their injuries. Mr Ahmed sustained lacerations to his sternum, left arm and back. He had sustained a total of five wounds, one to the mid-line of the sternum, one to the right arm and three wounds over the right scapula. 

37Mr Ram was stabbed in the chest and received a number of significant wounds to his hand as he tried to block the knife.
 
The Accused's Explanation for his Actions Provided in the ERISP

38In the ERISP conducted in the early hours of Sunday, 10 October 2010, the Accused readily admitted that he had stabbed C, Mr Ahmed and Mr Ram and that he had possessed the knife with intent to stab Constable Soprenic. 

39In the course of frequent rambling answers, the Accused asserted to police that he had ""Tyrannosaurus Rex blood in me"" (Q/A79) and that ""voices told me to sacrifice"" (Q/A81). Soon after, he told police that ""these voices said that I'm to kill my son ... then [L] and that little girl"" (Q/A83-84). 

40According to the Accused, the voices told him that if he did not ""kill my own"" then ""Armageddon would occur"" (Q/A89, 92). Answers of this type were a recurring theme throughout the ERISP.

41At one point, the Accused said ""I was told I'm used as, I am Armageddon ... I am a weapon ... of mass destruction"" (Q/A160-161).

42With respect to his attacks on Mr Ahmed and Mr Ram, the Accused explained ""if I didn't I'd be used as Armageddon and the world would be blown up"" and that ""I had to try to attack him and kill him"" (Q/A241-242).

43Later in the ERISP, the Accused explained how he heard the voices - ""I hear them and through sound effects, like, there's microphones set up in my house and stuff like that"" (Q/A563). 

44Towards the end of the ERISP, the Accused told police that he was ""hearing voices now"" (Q/A760). 
 
The Defence of Mental Illness

45Once the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the crimes with which the Accused is charged, the remaining issue is whether the Accused has available to him the defence of mental illness, as to which he bears the onus of proof on the balance of probabilities: Mizzi v The Queen [1960] HCA 77; 105 CLR 659 at 664-665. 

46In R v Rodriguez [2010] NSWSC 198, I described the defence of mental illness in the following way at [33]:

""If it appears that the Accused was mentally ill at the time when he committed the relevant acts, a Court must return a special verdict that he is not guilty by reason of mental illness: s.38(1) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. The defence of mental illness is to be determined in accordance with the M'Naghten rules laid down in R v M'Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718. Those rules provide that every person is presumed to be sane and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary is proven. To establish the defence of mental illness, it must be proved upon the balance of probabilities that at the time of committing the acts causing death, the Accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of his act, or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong. A person does not know what he was doing was wrong when he does not know that it is wrong according to the ordinary standards of right and wrong adopted by reasonable persons, or when he cannot reason with some moderate degree of calmness in relation to the moral quality of what he is doing: The King v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189-190. ""

47In R v Pratt [2009] NSWSC 1108 at [19]-[21], RA Hulme J provided the following helpful summary of relevant concepts:

""19In relation to the concept of a 'disease of the mind' which produces such a defect of reason, the law requires that the accused's state of mind must have been one of disease, disorder or disturbance arising from some condition. The condition may be temporary or of long standing. It does not matter whether it is curable or incurable. It must result in the function of the reason, memory or understanding of the person being thrown into a state of derangement or disorder. A defect of reason, memory or understanding involves a disorder of the capacity to reason such as one that prevented the accused from knowing what she was doing, in that she did not know the physical nature or quality of her acts, or did not know that those acts were wrong, that is, wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community.

20As to whether the accused did not know the acts to be wrong, the question is whether the accused could be said to know, in the sense of appreciating or understanding that the acts were wrong, if through a disease, disorder or disturbance of the mind she could not think rationally of the reasons which, to ordinary people, would make that act right or wrong.

21A final matter to observe is that if through a disordered condition of the mind the accused could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure, it would be open to find that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong.""

48With respect to medical evidence adduced at a trial involving the defence of mental illness, I observed in R v Rodriguez at [45]:

""Although medical evidence is not essential to prove the defence of mental illness (Lucas v The Queen [1970] HCA 14; [1970] 120 CLR 171 at 174), it is the invariable experience of criminal courts in this State that medical evidence is adduced on this issue. Juries (and Judges sitting alone) are not bound to accept and act upon expert evidence, but they are not entitled to disregard it capriciously: R v Hall (1988) 36 A Crim R 368 at 370; R v Klamo [2008] VSCA 75; (2008) 18 VR 644 at 655 [44]. A jury (or Judge sitting alone) ought not reject unanimous medical evidence unless there is evidence which can cast doubt upon the medical evidence: Hone v Western Australia [2007] WASCA 283; (2007) 179 A Crim R 138 at 146-148 [124]-[126]; R v Klamo at 644-645 [44]-[50].""


The Psychiatric Evidence

49Dr Clark examined the Accused at the Mental Health Screening Unit at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre, Silverwater (""MRRC""), on 9 November 2010, about a month after the events giving rise to the present charges.

50The report of Dr Clark dated 18 November 2010 confirms that the Accused has long-standing psychiatric problems. 

51At the time of writing his report, Dr Clark had available to him Justice Health medical records which revealed that the Accused had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia as early as 1997, and had been treated with anti-psychotic medication in 1998. At that time, the Accused was noted to believe that cameras were watching him. He was being treated for schizophrenia with injectable anti-psychotic medication, and was receiving intermittent follow-up from the Liverpool Community Mental Health Team.

52The Accused had two admissions to the Liverpool Hospital Mental Health Unit in August 1998 and again in September 1998, with diagnoses being made of mood disorder, opiate dependence, drug-induced psychosis and substance dependence.

53The records indicated that, in 2000, the Accused was referred to the Young People's Early Psychosis Intervention Program on the Central Coast whilst he was resident at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre.

54Dr Clark reported that the Accused had been in custody on a number of occasions. He would take anti-psychotic medication when in custody, but would stop taking the medication when released into the community. The Accused reported that, after his release from custody in 2003, he began to have more frequent paranoid thoughts about his neighbours.

55Dr Clark's report outlined anti-psychotic medication provided to the Accused over a number of years. The report also recounted attendance by the Accused at the Liverpool Emergency Department in July 2006, September 2006 and April 2010, on occasions when he had been brought there by police.

56On 19 August 2010, a mental health review was undertaken at the Liverpool Emergency Department and the Accused was assessed as being subject to a number of stressors. 

57The detailed and helpful report of Dr Clark outlined the Accused's psychiatric history, past medical and drug and alcohol history and his family and personal history. Dr Clark provided a mental status examination, before expressing a number of conclusions and recommendations (Exhibit 1, pages 8-9). These included:

""[The Accused] has a greater than ten year history of psychotic symptoms. These include paranoid and grandiose delusions, auditory and visual hallucinations, and reportedly bizarre behaviour. He has had intermittent treatment with potent anti-psychotic medications. He has had several hospitalisations for various behavioural disturbances and has at times sought assistance from mental health services. I believe that his most likely diagnosis is schizophrenia, with paranoid and disorganised features.""

58Dr Clark concluded that the Accused had ""limited insight and his functioning is severely impaired"". Dr Clark believed that the Accused, at that time, was ""a mentally ill person within the meaning of the Mental Health Act"". 

59The report of Dr Bangash dated 14 June 2011 (Exhibit 3) confirmed that the Accused had consulted him between November 2006 and 20 September 2010 for a number of conditions, including paranoid schizophrenia for which medication had been prescribed. 

60Dr Nielssen examined the Accused at the MRRC on 3 June 2011 at the request of the solicitor for the Accused. 
 
61Dr Nielssen's report recounted the history obtained from the Accused, including his psychiatric history, medical history and history of substance abuse. After setting out observations on mental state examination, Dr Nielssen recorded the following psychiatric diagnoses (Exhibit 2, page 6):

""1.Chronic schizophrenia, partially treatment resistant.

2.Substance dependence and abuse disorder, in remission.""

62Dr Nielssen expressed the following opinion concerning the mental state of the Accused at the time of events on 9 October 2010 (Exhibit 2, pages 6-7):

""From the information available it seems that [the Accused] was affected by an acute exacerbation of his chronic schizophrenic illness at the time of the offence and would have the defence of mental illness open to him. He had a disease of the mind in the form of a psychotic episode arising from a chronic schizophrenic illness, that gave rise to a defect of reason in the form of the belief that the voices he could hear were of real people describing real events and that he was compelled to obey them to prevent Armageddon. From the account he provided to me, which is supported by the symptoms he described in the ERISP, I believe he was aware of the physical quality of his action in stabbing his son, but was deprived of the capacity to reason with any measure of sense or composure about the moral wrongfulness of his actions.

I note the allegation that [the Accused] might have been motivated by his jealousy of [L's] new relationship. However, the nature of the offence, [the Accused's] account of his mental state at the time of the offences and the other information that is available are consistent with the offence being due to symptoms of schizophrenia rather than any rational motive.""

63In the course of evidence on 3 May 2012, Mr Winch asked Dr Nielssen (T19-20):

""Q. You have now seen the ERISP, and having seen the ERISP or parts of it, did viewing that ERISP in any way change the diagnosis that you made in your report? 

A. No, I thought his demeanour, considering the circumstances, was very abnormal.



Q. Tell me why?
A. He showed no emotional response and sort of blunting of emotional responses that was consistent with a schizophrenic illness, and he expressed - he described symptoms and bizarre beliefs consistent with that illness as well.

Q. Is it the case that the viewing of the ERISP confirmed in every respect in your view, your diagnosis?
A. Yes.""

64Soon after, Mr Winch asked Dr Nielssen (T20):

""Q. But the, if I could put it this way, there's no suggestion is there doctor, that these symptoms have been as it were, made up for the purpose of dealing with this difficulty with the law? 
A. No, there's a spontaneous account of them at the time of arrest and his account is quite consistent with many other people with mental illness who I've interviewed in similar situations. I think the spontaneous accounts and the observations made of [the Accused] in the period after his arrest when he was restarted on his treatment are also consistent with him having active symptoms of mental illness.

Q. In the end of your report, you note an allegation about [the Accused] having been motivated, perhaps by jealousy in committing the crime that he undoubtedly committed. You, in your report say that, 'His account of his mental state at the time of the offences and other information, is consistent with the offence being due to symptoms of schizophrenia rather than any other rational motive.' I take it that you mean by 'rational motive' a motive of jealousy, for example? 
A. Yes, a more understandable motive that wasn't associated with the loss of ability to realise that his actions were wrong.""


65Dr Wilcox examined the Accused at the MRRC on 12 September 2011 on behalf of the Crown. 

66The report of Dr Wilcox dated 8 October 2011 contained an extensive background history, the Accused's account of the alleged offences together with his psychiatric and drug and alcohol history and his medical and personal history. Dr Wilcox then turned to a selected document review and mental state examination of the Accused.
 
67Dr Wilcox recorded the following psychiatric diagnoses (Exhibit C, page 9):

""Chronic Paranoid Schizophrenia (partially treatment resistant)

Substance Abuse - heroin, prescribed sedatives (remission in a controlled environment)""

68Dr Wilcox provided a detailed opinion in support of the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia (pages 9-10):

""From age 17 years onwards he has had psychotic episodes characterised by persecutory beliefs that have been associated with prominent auditory hallucinations. The persecutory beliefs often resulted in conflict with neighbours and he has felt that he is being monitored and that he is under surveillance. Due to an escalation in his paranoia he has required hospitalisation on a number of occasions. There has been an associated decline in social function. [L] indicated that he experienced auditory hallucinations that were critical and constantly harassed him and that he did not believe that there was anything wrong with him.""

69Soon after, Dr Wilcox said (page 10):

""Some months prior to the alleged offence he stopped taking his antipsychotic medication as he felt that it made him mentally and physically ill and he had gained significant weight. At the same time he started to have the occasional short [sic] of heroin as he had also come off the methadone. He then presented to Liverpool Hospital seeking admission as he was not coping and was placed on buprenorphine (Subutex).

In the context of stopping his medication and being stressed about his recent drug use and his future relationship with [L] he experienced an acute exacerbation of his chronic schizophrenic illness. The exacerbation on this occasion was different to his usual presentation in that it was acute in onset and more bizarre in nature.""

70With direct reference to the Accused's mental state at the time of the events of 9 October 2010, Dr Wilcox said (pages 10-11):

""Despite his concerns about [L's] relationship I do not believe that his actions were motivated by his jealousy or a desire for revenge. The E.R.I.S.P conducted on the 10 October 2010 clearly indicates that his actions occurred as a result of his command auditory hallucinations and the associated delusional beliefs. When he stabbed his son he was suffering from a disease of the mind namely an acute exacerbation of his chronic schizophrenic illness. He experienced a defect of reason namely he believed that the voices he heard were real and if he did not obey the voice something bad would happen like Armageddon. He believed his son knew that he had to be sacrificed and that everyone around him was dead. He knew what he was doing but did not comprehend that what he was doing was wrong. He stabbed the two neighbours because the voices told him he had to harm other people and he was similarly unable to reason with sense and composure about the wrongfulness of his actions.""

71In oral evidence on 3 May 2012, Dr Wilcox observed that, during the ERISP, the Accused ""said a lot of very bizarre disconnected things"" (T9.27). 

72Dr Wilcox responded to questions from me concerning the Accused's appearance during the ERISP (T12-13):

""Q. ... You've seen the video of the interview? 
A. That's correct. 

Q. How would you describe the accused's affect, appearance or demeanour in that recording? 
A. He presented like someone with a chronic mental illness, his affect was somewhat restricted in that he showed somewhat minimal reduced range of emotion. He was, at times, quite distracted and preoccupied, and it was apparent during the interview that he was responding to voices. At times when the interviewing detectives were asking him questions, he lost his train of thought, then appeared to be just staring into space. On at least one or two occasions he said 'did you hear that', and then asked about voices which he believed were real, and he was quite convinced that there was someone talking in a space behind him, and he said, 'did you hear that? They said I'm insane.' 

Later on he said, 'Did you hear that? They said happy birthday.' His speech was very much ... typical of someone with a very disorganised period of psychosis, in that it was rambling, it was disconnected, it contained what we call neologisms, which is made up words. So the grammar was quite bizarre. So I had no doubt from watching the ERISP that there was a very unwell man. 

Q. And you of course in your extensive experience in forensic psychiatry and seeing persons who were affected by mental illness of this type, speaking? 
A. That's right. 

Q. Both in films of the type that you saw here but also in by direct observation of patients with whom you've examined or dealt? 
A. Yes, and he was quite typical of someone who was, what we would say floridly unwell.""

73The Crown Prosecutor then asked Dr Wilcox (T13): 

""Q. I think as part of your diagnosis and your opinion you considered whether or not he might have been motivated by anything other than his illness? 
A. I did consider that because of his, of the fact that his partner, the mother of the child, had a new relationship. This new partner was about to be released from custody, moving in to live with her. 

Q. After having taken those matters into account, did that in any way change your initial opinion that at the time of the commission of these offences, he was severely unwell? 
A. No. No. I didn't believe that at the time his actions were in any way motivated by revenge or jealousy. 

Q. It was as a result of being unwell and the auditory hallucinations and commands that he was being given?
A. Yes. I think at the time he wasn't even considering or thinking about his ex partner's relationship; that was far from his mind. He was in his own fantasy world and it didn't contain, or refer to that at all.""

74The Crown Prosecutor asked Dr Wilcox about the non-fatal attacks by the Accused after he had killed C (T13-14):

""Q. Can I ask you this: You principally concentrated in your report and the evidence that you've given today, in relation to the tragic death of his child? 
A. That's correct. 

Q. Can I take you to the other events that occurred shortly thereafter; the attack on the two men that were at the unit block and the confrontation with the police officer. Is it your view that he was mentally unwell at that time as well? 
A. Yes. I believe he was still in this same psychotic phase where he believed that he had to sacrifice, and once he felt he completed the sacrifice of his son, the voices continued to tell him that he had to go and do further sacrifices. And I believe that it's probably very lucky that his partner and the young child who was with her that day, weren't present; that he may have even gone on and harmed her. So I believe that it was all part of the whole scenario that was going on at that time. 



Q. As evidenced by the way he presented as well when he was interviewed by police some hours later? 
A. That's correct, yes. I mean, the other factor was, there was no reason for him to attack those other two individuals; he didn't know them; they hadn't been in any conflict. There had been no trigger. So it was quite bizarre and not understandable by any logical rational process. 

Q. Other than he was mentally ill? 
A. Other than he was mentally ill.""

Determination Concerning Defence of Mental Illness

75Both the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the Accused submitted that the defence of mental illness had been established, on the balance of probabilities, in this case with respect to each of the offences with which the Accused stands charged. 

76It will be apparent that Dr Nielssen and Dr Wilcox have expressed their opinions by reference to the elements of the defence of mental illness. 

77Both psychiatrists are satisfied that the Accused, at the time when he killed C and at the times when he wounded Mr Ahmed and Mr Ram and possessed the knife with intent to assault Constable Soprenic, suffered from a defect of reason from a disease of the mind. 

78Dr Nielssen described the disease of the mind as being a psychotic episode arising from a chronic schizophrenic illness. This disease of the mind gave rise to a defect of reason, the belief of the Accused that the voices he could hear were of real people describing real events and that he was compelled to obey to prevent Armageddon. The critical finding of Dr Nielssen is that the Accused ""was aware of the physical quality of his action"" but was ""deprived of the capacity to reason with any measure of sense or composure about the moral wrongfulness of his actions"".

79Dr Wilcox considered that the Accused was suffering from a disease of the mind, being an acute exacerbation of his chronic schizophrenic illness. He experienced a defect of reason (arising from the disease of the mind) in that he believed that the voices he heard were real and, if he did not obey them, something bad would happen like Armageddon. Dr Wilcox considered that the Accused ""knew what he was doing but did not comprehend that what he was doing was wrong"" and that he ""stabbed the two neighbours because the voices told him he had to harm other people and he was similarly unable to reason with sense and composure about the wrongfulness of his actions"". 

80Accordingly, the expert medical evidence from two most experienced forensic psychiatrists supports the defence of mental illness for the Accused on each count. I accept the evidence of each of the psychiatrists. 

81The ERISP conducted with the Accused soon after these tragic events strongly supports the defence of mental illness. Both the words spoken by the Accused, and his manner and appearance during the interview, evidence the existence of significant mental illness at that time. Dr Nielssen noted that the Accused ""showed no emotional response"" and ""a sort of blunting of emotional responses that was consistent with schizophrenia illness"" whilst describing ""symptoms and bizarre beliefs consistent with that illness as well"". Dr Wilcox observed that the Accused ""said a lot of very bizarre disconnected things"" with a reduced range of emotion and rambling and bizarre grammar which was ""typical of someone who was ... floridly unwell"".

82The acts of the Accused also provide strong support for the defence of mental illness. He attacked and killed C, and then attacked and wounded Mr Ahmed and Mr Ram and was prepared to do the same to Constable Soprenic, in circumstances where he was suffering an acute exacerbation of his chronic schizophrenic illness, and was hearing voices commanding him to act in the ways in which he did. Both psychiatrists exclude a scenario which would have the Accused acting out of jealousy to kill C. The totality of the Accused's acts, including the otherwise inexplicable attacks upon the two neighbours, support the opinions of the psychiatrists, which I accept.

83I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, at the time of the fatal attack upon C and the Accused's actions involving Mr Ahmed, Mr Ram and Constable Soprenic, the Accused suffered from a disease of the mind, namely an acute exacerbation of his chronic schizophrenic illness. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, at those times, the Accused suffered from a defect of reason from that disease of the mind, in that he did not know that his actions were morally wrong. He could not reason with some moderate degree of calmness in relation to the moral quality of what he was doing (see [46]-[47] above).

84I propose to return a special verdict that the Accused is not guilty by reason of mental illness with respect to each count on the indictment.

Section 39 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990

85Given the proposed verdicts, it is necessary for the Court to consider what further order ought be made under s.39 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. That provision is in the following terms:

""39 Effect of finding and declaration of mental illness

(1) If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence, the jury returns a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness, the Court may order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law or may make such other order (including an order releasing the person from custody, either unconditionally or subject to conditions) as the Court considers appropriate.

(2) The Court is not to make an order under this section for the release of a person from custody unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release.

(3) As soon as practicable after the making of an order under this section, the Registrar of the Court is to notify the Minister for Health and the Tribunal of the terms of the order.""

86The Crown Prosecutor submitted, and Mr Winch accepted, that the only appropriate order to be made in this case is an order for detention of the Accused. 

87The evidence reveals that the Accused has a long history of mental illness, in the form of chronic paranoid schizophrenia (partially treatment resistant). This mental illness has included paranoid thoughts concerning other persons, including neighbours. The conduct of the Accused on 9 October 2010 reveals the actual danger which he posed to all those who became victims of his acts, and the danger which he posed to others, including (if they had been in the unit) L and the little girl.

88It is entirely clear that the only appropriate order is a detention order under s.39(1) of the Act.

89If this trial had proceeded before a jury, it would have been necessary for the jury to be informed of the legal and practical consequences of a finding of not guilty by reason of mental illness: s.37 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. The purpose of s.37 is to ensure that the jury understands the consequences of a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness, including the terms of s.39 of the Act and the role of the Court and the Mental Health Review Tribunal with respect to the protection of the community and the person who may be acquitted on those grounds: R v Rodriguez at [56]. 

90It is important that the community understands that the effect of the findings and orders which I will make is that the Accused will remain in detention and be held as a forensic patient, to come under the supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. The statutory scheme surrounding that Tribunal is such that the Accused will not be released until the Tribunal is satisfied that the safety of any member of the public, or the safety of the Accused, will not be seriously endangered by his release. The case of the Accused will be reviewed by the Tribunal as soon as practicable and will be subject to review at six-monthly intervals. If, at some stage in the future the Accused comes to be released, it may be on conditions and, if any of those conditions are breached, or his mental condition deteriorates to a point where he may be a serious danger to others, the Tribunal may order that he be apprehended and further detained. In cases such as this, it is important that the community understands the practical reality of the orders which are made. 

91Before concluding this judgment, I wish to direct some comments to those affected by the events which have given rise to this trial. On behalf of the community, the Court expresses its condolences to L for the tragic loss of her son. 

92It is appropriate to acknowledge as well that others have suffered, including Mr Ahmed, Mr Ram and Constable Soprenic, as a result of the terrible events of 9 October 2010. 

Verdicts and Orders

2416983,R v Pratten (No 8) [2012] NSWSC 1671,"EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT


	
	HIS HONOUR: The issue before the Court is the admission into evidence of the document marked MFI 60, which is an ASIC historical company extract for 71 Cowper Street Holdings Pty Ltd. The extract evidences, and is sought to be tendered because it evidences, that Commercial Pacific Insurance Ltd, a company that has received significant attention throughout the course of these proceedings, became a shareholder in 71 Cowper Street Holdings Pty Ltd, a company that also has received significant attention in the course of these proceedings.
	
	
	The accused, who is seeking to tender the documents, wishes the jury to draw an inference on the balance of probabilities that Commercial Pacific Insurance Ltd became a shareholder in 71 Cowper Street as consideration for the reduction in debt owing to it of approximately $876,000. The transfer, it seems, on any analysis of the documentation, must have been from Mr Pratten, the accused.
	
	
	Earlier in these proceedings, I was asked to rule, and did rule, on the admissibility of a transfer of shares that was tendered by the accused (Transcript 1140). That transfer of shares was tendered essentially on the same basis, that is, to prove the same inference that otherwise would have been proved, or is sought to be proved, by the document now before me.
	
	
	The difference between the circumstances arising at that time and this time is that evidence is now before the Court which shows the reduction in indebtedness from Mr Pratten to Commercial Pacific Ltd at a time subsequent to 30 June 2009 but before 21 May 2012.
	
	
	While the jury would not necessarily draw an inference that the reduction in indebtedness was as a result of the transfer shares, it seems to me it would be an inference that would be available to them, and in those circumstances, it is not my function to deny them information from which they could draw such an inference.
	
	
	It seems to me that the reduction in indebtedness as a result of the transfer of shares, if that inference were drawn, is a matter that reflects on the legitimacy of the loan, if it were a loan, from Commercial Pacific Insurance Ltd to Mr Pratten, and the repayment of it. In those circumstances, I would admit MFI 60 into evidence.

		16 July 2013",2012-05-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2417059,Zaki v R [2012] NSWCCA 109,"Judgment
1HOEBEN JA:  In this matter I agree with the orders proposed by Fullerton J and with her Honour's analysis of the effect of the report of Dr Nielssen of 6 December 2011.  The report provides no principled basis for this Court interfering with the sentence imposed on the applicant.
2Regrettably, I disagree with that part of her Honour's judgment which would admit the report of Dr Nielssen.  While it is necessary for this Court to read the report so as to determine whether one of the recognised bases for admissibility has been established, having done so I am not so satisfied.  In par [20] Fullerton J has helpfully set out the exceptions to the general rule that evidence of facts existing at the time of sentencing, is not received when that evidence could have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence.  The report of Dr Nielssen does not come within any of those exceptions.
3In my opinion, it is not sufficient for the admission of that report that it provides an insight into the applicant's mental health which was a matter agitated at the sentence hearing, but not fully explored.  More needs to be established before such a report should be admitted in sentence proceedings.
4RS HULME J:  I agree with Hoeben JA and, subject to his Honour's remarks, with the reasons of Fullerton J.  I agree also with the orders proposed by Fullerton J.
5FULLERTON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court on 31 March 2011 after he pleaded guilty in the Local Court to two counts of deemed supply of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 
6After taking into account the principle of totality, the sentencing judge imposed an aggregate head sentence of 3 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years which is due to expire on 15 August of this year.  In respect of the first supply count, a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months with a balance of term of the same length was imposed.  The second count attracted a fixed term of 12 months, partly accumulated on the first count.  That sentence commenced on 16 August 2010 and expired on 15 August 2011. 
7The first count concerns the applicant's possession of 8.95 grams of methylamphetamine in five separate bags which, together with a small amount of cannabis, some money, a credit card in the name of another person and various items of drug paraphernalia, were located by police in a black bag in the applicant's car when it collided with a pole in the early morning of 25 October 2009.  He was taken to hospital after the accident and was treated for injuries (including head injuries) where he remained until 10 November 2009.  The statement of agreed facts records that upon admission tests confirmed the presence of methylamphetamine in his blood at 0.17mg/L.  Unsurprisingly, this was reported by a pharmacologist to have substantially impaired his capacity to drive a motor vehicle.
8On 17 November 2009, after the applicant's release from hospital, he attended Marrickville police station where he was arrested and charged and then released into the care of his brother.  A court attendance notice was served on 7 December 2009 charging him with possession of the 8.95 grams of methylamphetamine (the subject of the first supply count), together with other charges relating to the other items in the black bag which were taken into account on a Form 1 when the sentence on the first supply count was imposed. 
9In unrelated sentence proceedings before the Local Court on 6 July 2010 the applicant was placed on a good behaviour bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for two counts of possessing a prohibited drug on 16 January 2010.  That offence was committed whilst he was on bail for the offences the subject of the first count.  The sentencing judge also noted that the applicant was subject to that bond when, on 16 August 2010, he was arrested in possession of 3.07 grams of methylamphetamine after police observed him sitting in his car in an area in Camperdown notorious for drug related activity.  Those drugs were the subject of the second supply count. 
10The head injuries the applicant sustained in the accident in October 2009 and his addiction to drugs dating from 2007 were considered in a report by Dr Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, dated 6 December 2011 and in a supplementary report of 7 February 2012.  Both reports were obtained after sentence and were tendered on the appeal in support of the applicant's contention that a miscarriage of justice resulted from the failure on the part of his legal representatives to obtain evidence of his psychiatric condition for use in the sentence proceedings and, that on re-sentence, this Court would reduce the sentences imposed having regard to that evidence.  This was the only ground of appeal.
11The Crown objected to the tender of the report on the basis that they did not constitute fresh evidence and, if admitted, would not justify any reduction in sentence.
12In his report of 6 December 2011, Dr Nielssen made the following diagnoses: 1.  Substance dependence and abuse disorder, in remission2.  Depressive illness, in partial remission3.  Traumatic brain damage affecting the frontal lobes of the brain.
13He also reported that on examination of the applicant there were no obvious signs of neurological injury including abnormal movements or slowness of speech and no thought disorganisation.  The applicant's performance in a screening test for cognitive impairment across a range of cognitive functions, showed no impairment in attention, concentration, registration, recall, verbal fluency, naming of objects or in visuo-spatial skills.
14Based in large part upon information suppled by the applicant, Dr Nielssen expressed the following opinions:The diagnosis of substance abuse disorder is based on Mr Zaki's account of daily or regular use of methamphetamine, cannabis and alprazolam in the years leading up to his arrest, and complications of substance use, including the contribution to anxiety and depression, unemployment, the car accident and the criminal convictions.  The disorder is described as being in remission after eighteen months in an environment with reduced access to drugs or sedative medication.
The diagnosis of depressive illness is made on the basis of Mr Zaki's account of treatment for anxiety and depression by a psychiatrist over a period of several years, and the history of a serious suicide attempt and a long admission for treatment of depression in the months after the head injury.  Depression is a common complication of traumatic brain injury, and is also a predictable consequence of long term abuse of methamphetamine.
...
The diagnosis of traumatic brain injury is based on the history of a head injury in a motor vehicle accident resulting in an admission to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, confirmed by the ambulance records.  The head injury would be classified as serious, on the basis of the history of post traumatic amnesia of more than ten days, although he reported that part of that was in a medically induced coma.  He reported that he sustained frontal lobe damage and had memory problems after the accident.  There was subtle evidence of impairment in frontal lobe function at the time of the recent interview, as he was labile in mood and mildly uninhibited in a way that was consistent with that form of injury.
From the information that is available, there would appear to be a causal relationship between his daily use of drugs and his possession of what would have been around two weeks supply of amphetamine.  [Dr Nielssen appears to be referring here to the offending the subject of the first supply count.]  Moreover, it is likely that he experienced a cycle of substance use complicated by anxiety and depression which he relieved by further drug use.  Impairment in social judgment, loss of inhibition and depression following the head injury is likely to have contributed to the second offence.
15It is clear from the sentencing remarks that his Honour was aware that the applicant sustained head injuries in the car accident that gave rise to the charging of the first supply count and that he was admitted to hospital for treatment.  There was no evidence tendered on sentence directed to whether the applicant suffered from any neurological dysfunction as a result of the head injuries, or evidence from a forensic psychiatrist that suggested any causal relationship with the second supply offence committed in August 2010.  The only reference to the applicant seeking psychiatric intervention of any kind was in a pre-sentence report dated 28 March 2011 where he informed the Probation and Parole officer that he commenced consultations with a psychiatrist after he had attempted self-harm in January 2010 and that he had been seen by both psychological and psychiatric services whilst in prison following his remand after his arrest in August 2010.  The Probation and Parole officer also noted that that the applicant had been in receipt of a Disability Support Pension since 2003 due to his depression and anxiety.  
16In support of the submission advanced on sentence that the applicant suffered from ""mental health issues"", and for that reason he was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, the applicant's solicitor relied solely upon a report generated from a general practitioner at a Medical and Dental Centre dated 6 August 2010, ten days before the applicant committed the second supply offence.  The report recorded a diagnosis of depression and panic disorders and provided for a pharmacologically based treatment plan.  No further assessments and no cognitive behavioural therapy were recommended.  The report does not mention any drug abuse or addiction to illicit drugs.  The pro forma check list, which comprised part of the tendered report, recorded that the applicant's thinking, perception, cognition, memory, sleep and judgment were normal without any suicidal ideation, but that his attention and concentration levels and anxiety and mood were other than normal.  There was nothing in the report which elaborated on the distinction between ""normal"" and ""other than normal"". 
17In the sentencing remarks his Honour said:[The applicant] has been receiving for some time medication for depression and anxiety.  He reported to the Probation and Parole officer that he attempted self-harm in January 2010, prior to the commission of the offences on 16 August 2010, and that he had commenced consultation with a psychiatrist. 
There is, however, no report before the Court that relates to any psychiatric condition or mental illness concern.  I do nevertheless accept that he has suffered depression and emotional turmoil resulting from his divorce, as well as from the collapse of his business.  While it is said that he has been seen by both psychological and psychiatric services during his incarceration, there is no report but merely the bare reference to that matter in the pre-sentence report.
18The Crown objected to the tender of Dr Nielssen's reports on the basis that the applicant's legal representatives at sentence being aware of his hospital admission in circumstances where a report from a consultant forensic psychiatrist or neurologist could have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence and therefore not fresh evidence (see R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417).  That objection does not dispose of the issue as to whether the Court should receive Dr Nielssen's reports on this application. 
19Whether the principled distinction between new evidence and fresh evidence on an appeal against conviction applies in the same or a similar way when an applicant appeals against sentence, was raised without being decided in R v Ryan [2011] NSWCCA 69 at [53].  That question might have been revisited in this case were argument directed to it.  It was not.  In Ryan RS Hulme J (with whom McColl JA and Hislop J agreed) applied what his Honour recognised as the restrictive approach this Court has taken to the reception of evidence tendered on a sentence appeal when compared with the approach taken to new or fresh evidence on a conviction appeal (see Iglesias v R [2006] NSWCCA 261 at [10] and Springer v R [2007] NSWCCA 289; 177 A Crim R 13).  I see no basis for taking a different approach to the reception of Dr Nielssen's reports on this appeal.   
20This is not a case that concerns post-sentencing events or post-sentencing conduct which, in an appropriate or exceptional case, may be taken into account when determining whether a different sentence should be imposed.  Examples of cases in this category were discussed by McClellan CJ at CL in Springer at [3].  His Honour also recognised there are occasions when evidence of facts existing at the time of the original sentence are received in evidence on the appeal where the offender did not realise their significance at the time of sentence and could not inform his legal advisers of them (R v Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328 at 330 per Hunt J; R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 257; R v W [2001] NSWCCA 172 at [23]; R v MJM [2004] NSWCCA 66 at [46]); or evidence of facts or events occurring after sentencing which showed the true significance or provided the basis for a full appreciation of facts in existence at the time of sentencing (R v Smith (1987) 44 SASR 587 at 588 per King CJ; R v P [2003] NSWCCA 298 at [19]; R v MJM [2004] NSWCCA 66 at [46]).  
21Although the applicant's counsel did not seek to persuade the Court that Dr Nielssen's reports fell into any particular category of case identified in Springer, it could not be said that the applicant's mental condition was such that he could have failed to appreciate the significance of the matters Dr Nielssen reported upon given his letter to the sentencing judge tendered to supplement his oral evidence, and his demonstrated capacity for giving a reliable history to both Dr Nielssen and the Probation and Parole officer.  
22It would appear that counsel relied instead upon the failure of the applicant's legal representatives to appreciate the significance (or the potential significance) of the applicant's head injury, and that this explained their failure to obtain a report from a forensic psychiatrist concerning the applicant's mental health generally.  I note that when the sentencing judge raised the lack of a report with the applicant's solicitor she indicated that the Legal Aid Commission would not fund the preparation of a report.  There was no affidavit from the applicant's solicitor addressing either of these issues.  In addition, there was no evidence on the appeal shedding any light on whether it was the policy of the Legal Aid Commission that reports of the kind referred to would not be funded, or whether the applicant's legal representatives merely believed that a report would not be obtained under the grant of legal aid.  Because of the view I have taken of the weight to be attributed to Dr Nielssen's opinion on the causal connection between the head injury and the commission of the second offence, the competence of the applicant's legal representatives does not need to be resolved.  I would admit Dr Nielssen's reports on the basis that they do provide insights into the applicant's mental health, a matter agitated at the sentence hearing but not able to be fully explored or accounted for in the sentencing process.
23There are established principles that apply to the calculation of sentence where an offender is suffering from mental illness, an intellectual handicap or other mental problems (see Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]).  It was not submitted that Dr Nielssen's reports would have supported a submission that the applicant's experience of custody would be more onerous because of his mental health or that it reduced or eliminated the significance of specific deterrence [see for example R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [26]).  Counsel relied upon what Dr Nielssen opined as a causal connection between the head injuries and the conduct comprehended by the second supply count which, he submitted, reduced the applicant's moral culpability for that offence and the weight to be afforded general deterrence (see for example Israil at [23]). 
24In the course of argument counsel conceded that the potential impact of the applicant's head injuries on his capacity for rational and uncompromised decision making was only capable of ameliorating the objective seriousness of the offending the subject of the second count, there being no suggestion that he suffered any neurological deficit at the time of his possession of the drugs for supply, the subject of the first count.  Dr Nielssen did report upon a causal connection between the applicant's drug use and his drug offending generally, and although counsel sought to draw some comfort from that in connection with the offending the subject of the first count, it is well recognised that drug addiction, whilst often causally connected to the supply of drugs in the sense of it providing both context and motivation for that offending, does not operate in mitigation of penalty (R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [178]).  For this reason, I do not consider that Dr Nielssen's views as to the association between the applicant's drug use and his supply of drugs have any relevance to the sentence imposed on either count.
25The sentence on the second count - a fixed term of 12 months - has now expired.  Of itself that does not dispose of the appeal so far as the challenge to the sentence is concerned.  That challenge fails for other reasons.  What has not been demonstrated is that Dr Nielssen's opinion as to the likelihood of impairment in the applicant's social judgment and impulse control as a result of the car accident, when considered with the other evidence tendered on the sentence proceedings and which this Court is entitled to consider, would permit a conclusion to be drawn of the necessary causal connection between the brain injury in October 2009 and the offending in August 2010, such as to invoke application of the principles in De La Rosa.  For my part, I would not draw that conclusion based upon Dr Nielssen's assessment of the subtle (which I take to be mild) effects of the brain injury, and what I regard as the applicant's long standing addiction to drugs as the predominant factor underlying his continued offending after the car accident.  
26I am conscious, as McClellan CJ at CL observed in De La Rosa at [178], that the mental health problems of an offender need not be serious or constitute a serious psychiatric illness before they are relevant to the sentencing process.  I am simply not persuaded that the brain injury the applicant suffered is relevantly causative.  I note that the sentencing judge considered the applicant's depression and anxiety in the calculation of sentence on both counts and I am well satisfied this was accorded appropriate weight.
27The orders I propose are:1.  Leave to appeal is granted.2.  The appeal is dismissed.

		25 June 2012",2012-06-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2417084,MACKENZIE v R (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 122,"Judgment
1RS HULME J:  The Court delivered a judgment concerning this matter on 25 February 2011 - Mackenzie v R [2011] NSWCCA 21.
2By letter dated 25 February, but received by the Court on 1 March 2011, the solicitors for the Applicant made a request that the Court correct it.  That request was made under Rule 50C of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952 and was within the 14 day period thereby limited.  
3The Applicant had been sentenced in respect of four offences the subject of four Court Attendance Notices referred to as ""CANs 1 to 4"".  The correction sought was expressed as follows:-
It appears that in the process of re-sentencing the Appellant on CAN 1 and 3, and varying the sentences on CAN 2 and 4, the sentences imposed upon CAN 3 (reckless wounding) and CAN 4 (intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm) have been transposed.  Whilst the transposition has no effect on the aggregate sentence or non-parole period imposed upon the Appellant, it is respectfully requested that this matter be brought to his Honour Justice Giles' attention for correction.
4Justice Giles has retired and this decision and these reasons are of the other members of the bench, Justice RS Hulme and Justice Adams.
5The offences charged and the sentences which were the subject of appeal were as follows:-
CAN 1:  Assault occasioning actual bodily harm - imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months commencing on 28 February 2009.
CAN 2:  Intimidation - imprisonment for 1 year commencing on 28 February 2009.
CAN 3:  Reckless wounding. - imprisonment for 2 years commencing on 28 February 2010 with an additional term of 1 year and 4 months.
CAN  4:  Intimidation - imprisonment for 1 year commencing on 28 August 2009.
6The application for leave to appeal complained only of the sentences imposed on CANs 1 and 3.  There was no appeal in respect of the sentences imposed in respect of the offences the subject of CANs 2 and 4. 
7At [39] of his reasons, Giles JA adverted to the fact that the Court could vary the sentences on CANs 2 and 4 pursuant to the terms of s 7(1A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 but at [42] remarked that those sentences ""are not open to be varied"".  In that same paragraph, his Honour said there should be sequential partial accumulation of all sentences.
8His Honour then proposed the following orders:-
(1) Grant leave to appeal.
(2) Appeal allowed.
(3) Quash the sentences imposed on CANS 1 and 3.
(4)Sentence the appellant on CANs 1 and 3 and vary the sentences on CANs 2 and 4 as follows - 
CAN 1:  imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 years (sic) and 8 months commencing on 28 February 2009 and expiring on 27 October 2010.
CAN 2:  imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year commencing on 28 February 2010 and to expire on 27 February 2011.
CAN 3:  imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year commencing on 28 August 2010 and to expire on 27 August 2011
CAN 4:  imprisonment for a non-parole period of 8 months to commence on 28 June 2011 and to expire on 28 February 2012 and a balance of term of 1 year and 4 months to expire on 27 June 2013
The appellant will be eligible for release on parole on 27 February 2012.  It will be seen that this is the same effective sentence as before
9The effect of these orders was thus to increase the sentence for the offence the subject of CAN 4, one of those which his Honour was said was not open to be varied and which was not the subject of appeal, from a fixed term of 12 months to one of 2 years including a non-parole period of 8 months.  Demonstrably, the error to which the Applicant's solicitors adverted in their letter of 25 February 2011 occurred.
10Accordingly, I propose the following orders:-
(1) Set aside the orders in respect of CAN 3 and CAN 4 made on 25 February 2011.
(2)Sentence the Applicant on CANs 3 and 4 as follows:-
CAN 4:  imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year commencing on 28 August 2010 expiring on 27 August 2011.
CAN 3:  imprisonment for a non-parole period of 8 months to commence on 28 June 2011 and expiring on 27 February 2012 and a balance of term of 1 year and 4 months commencing on 28 February 2012 and expiring on 27 June 2013.
11ADAMS J:  I agree with RS Hulme J.

		06 June 2012",2012-06-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2417167,R v Nolan [2012] NSWCCA 126,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Shane Nolan, the respondent, was charged with an offence which was pleaded as follows:

""On about 5 May 2010 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, did without requisite approval being obtained, intentionally import goods, being tier 1 goods comprising pseudoephedrine, being reckless as to the fact that the goods were tier 1 goods, and being goods the importation of which is prohibited under the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), in that he did aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of that offence by Brent Luke Simpson.""

2The relevant offence is found in s 233BAA of the Customs Act 1901. Mr Nolan pleaded not guilty. At the conclusion of the Crown case the trial judge directed the jury to acquit the respondent. The Director of Public Prosecutions of the Commonwealth challenges that decision. 

3The appeal to this Court is made pursuant to s 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. That section allows the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal to this Court against any acquittal at the direction of the trial judge. Sub-section 2 confines the appeal to ""any ground that involves a question of law alone.""

4The grounds of appeal were pleaded in the following terms:

1.In determining that the importation had ended upon the full substitution of the pseudoephedrine, his Honour did not properly apply the definition of importation in Calderwood v The Queen (2007) 172 A Crim R 208;
2.In determining the point at which the importation of pseudoephedrine ended, his Honour did not properly distinguish between offences relating to importation under the Criminal Code (Cth) and offences under the Customs Act 1901.

5The facts were not in dispute. The Crown case was that the respondent, along with Greta Peters, assisted or encouraged the principal offender, Brent Simpson. Simpson had arranged for some marble items, which included three stools, to be sent from Thailand to Australia. The importation was by a ship travelling from Bangkok to Singapore, Brisbane and eventually Sydney. The shipment had arrived in Australia on 24 April 2010 and was intercepted in Sydney by the Australian Customs Service. The three stools were found to contain, after drilling a hole into the interior of each, a quantity of pure pseudoephedrine being slightly below 2 kgs of the drug. The police made a complete substitution of self-raising flour for the drug and the consignment was then allowed to clear customs. 

6Simpson used a shipping agent. Through that agent he arranged for the parcel containing the 3 stools to be collected and delivered to Ms Peters' home in Elderslie, a suburb of Western Sydney. Various communications were intercepted from 3 May 2010, shortly before the consignment was due for delivery. These communications included SMS messages and telephone calls. They indicated that Simpson had arranged for the respondent to conduct what the prosecution described as ""counter surveillance"" near Ms Peters' property on 4 May 2010, when the delivery of the stools was expected. The respondent attended the premises on the morning of 4 May 20102. The parcel was delivered that morning. Arrangements were made by Simpson to fly to Sydney from Queensland the following day. He arranged with the respondent to be picked up from Sydney airport in a car which the respondent drove.

7Before his arrival in Sydney, Simpson sent an SMS message to the respondent in the following terms:

""In air now. Box opened. All sweet. Get yr mates ready."" (sic)

8The respondent collected Simpson from the airport and drove him to Ms Peters' house. The three stools were loaded into the boot of the car, apparently by Simpson and not by the respondent. The vehicle remained at the property for a matter of 2 minutes and then drove away. The respondent was driving and Simpson was in the passenger seat. The vehicle was stopped almost immediately and the respondent and Simpson were arrested.

9As recorded by the trial judge, the prosecution case was that Simpson intentionally imported pseudoephedrine and arranged for it to be taken to Ms Peters' house. He was not aware that before arriving at her house the drug had been substituted with flour. The prosecution asserted that the respondent assisted and encouraged the endeavours of Simpson to take delivery of the consignment at Ms Peters' house. The prosecution submitted that he did this by agreeing to conduct counter-surveillance on the morning of 4 May, and on 5 May collected Simpson from the airport and drove him to the Elderslie property where the stools were collected.

10The trial judge recorded the Crown's acceptance that there was no evidence capable of establishing that the respondent did anything which would constitute aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring any conduct by Simpson in relation to the consignment prior to the afternoon of 3 May 2010. His Honour said:

""In other words it is common ground that the accused did not play any role as in aiding and abetting until after the drugs had been seized by the authorities, replaced with flour, never to be released thereafter.""

11The trial judge also said that:

""it is common ground that there is evidence capable of establishing that the accused, on the Crown case, from the afternoon of 3 May 2010 at the earliest, but mainly upon 4 and 5 May, aided, abetted counselled or procured the continuation of Simpson's efforts to obtain possession of the stools which Simpson believed to contain the illicit drugs."" (emphasis in original)

12The trial judge recorded the Crown's concession that this was not a case where evidence of an accused's later actions supported an inference that he had had some earlier involvement in arranging for the goods to be imported. As his Honour put the matter: ""the Crown case is simply that the accused became involved from the afternoon of 3 May and that the venture or process of importing by Simpson, on the Crown's case, was still on foot and remained so until his arrest."" 

13Section 233BAA(4) is in the following terms:

""A person is guilty of an offence against this subsection if:

(a)the person intentionally imported goods; and

(b)the goods were tier 1 goods and the person was reckless as to that fact; and

(c)their importation:
(i)was prohibited under this Act absolutely; or
(ii)was prohibited under this Act unless the approval of a particular person had been obtained and, at the time of the importation, that approval had not been obtained.""

14Complicity and common purpose are set out in s 11.2 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Section 11.2 provides:

""(1)A person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence by another person is taken to have committed that offence and is punishable accordingly.

(2)For the person to be guilty:

(a)the person's conduct must have in fact aided, abetted, counselled or procured the commission of the offence by the other person; and
(b)the offence must have been committed by the other person.

(3)For the person to be guilty, the person must have intended that:

(a)his or her conduct would aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of any offence (including its fault elements) of the type the other person committed; or
(b)his or her conduct would aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of an offence and have been reckless about the commission of the offence (including its fault elements) that the other person in fact committed.""

15Before the trial judge there was a discussion about the reach of the word ""imported"" in s 233BAA(4)(a). That discussion required the Court to consider two decisions of this Court. The first decision was Calderwood v R [2007] NSWCCA 180; (2007) 172 A Crim R 208, a decision in relation to the Customs Act, and the later decision of R v Campbell [2008] NSWCCA 214; (2008) 73 NSWLR 272, which was concerned with provisions of the Commonwealth Criminal Code relating to the illegal importation of goods. The trial judge accepted that the applicable law in the present case was to be found in Calderwood but ultimately that was not the issue upon which his decision turned. I shall return to that discussion later.

16His Honour's decision ultimately turned on the fact that by the time the respondent was involved in the criminal enterprise the drug had been substituted with flour. His Honour was persuaded that, accordingly, having regard to the fact that the applicant only became involved in the enterprise when the furniture had arrived at Ms Peters' premises, he could not be convicted of aiding and abetting a completed offence. His Honour accepted that if he could be convicted of any offence it could only be an attempt to commit the relevant offence. His Honour said:

""In my view the jury cannot, at law, convict the accused of the charge upon which he has been arraigned. It is an undisputed fact on the evidence that police took possession of the drugs referred to in the charge on the morning of 3 May 2010 'at the latest.' The accused's involvement in allegedly aiding, abetting or counselling or procuring the commission 'of that offence by Brent Luke Simpson' did not commence until the afternoon of 3 May 'at the earliest.' It is my view that the accused could not have, at that time, aided and abetted the co-offender Brent Luke Simpson in the offence of 'intentionally import goods, being tier one goods comprising pseudoephedrine', as it was an impossibility.

I have already recorded that I accept the law as concerns meaning of the word 'import' or its derivatives is as decided by the Court of Criminal Appeal to which I have referred but, in my view, the accused cannot be convicted of the charge as worded against him. It is arguable - if the jury were to accept all of the evidence led and which I observe does not appear to be disputed at all - that the accused would be liable to be charged with attempting an offence, including attempting to obtain possession of the goods."" (emphasis in original)

17For these reasons his Honour directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty. 

18In Calderwood this Court considered s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901. That section makes it an offence to ""import"" into Australia any relevant ""prohibited imports."" The Crown case was that the appellant (and another) were involved in the importation of the relevant drugs. The act that constituted the offence was said to be to ""import"" (the verb) and the enterprise was said to be the ""importation"" (the noun) of the relevant drugs.

19The issue that this Court was required to consider in Calderwood was whether the trial judge was correct in directing the jury that ""importing is a process of importing. It does not just stop the minute something lands in Australia because the person who is doing the importing is seeking to get his hands on it after the goods have landed in Australia ...""

20I concluded (and this conclusion was agreed in by Hulme and Hislop JJ) that the direction was correctly given. In so doing I relied upon the decisions of this Court in R v Lam (1990) 46 A Crim R; R v Courtney-Smith (No 2) (1990) 48 A Crim R 49; R v Leff (1996) 86 A Crim R 212 and R v Sukkar [2005] NSWCCA 54.

21Campbell was concerned with an offence against s 307.11 of the Criminal Code. That section makes it an offence for a person to import certain substances. Spigelman CJ, with the agreement of Weinberg AJA and Simpson J, held that in the context of a criminal code dealing with a wide range of drug offences, the word ""imports"" in s 307.11 of the Code had been given a precise rather than an expansive meaning. His Honour determined that the word ""import"" is distinct from the word ""importation"" used in the legislative predecessor to the Code being the relevant provisions of the Customs Act. Spigelman CJ examined the cases that I relied upon in Calderwood but concluded that the flexibility in the concept of importing previously identified by the Court derived primarily from the words found in the aiding and abetting provision in s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act. That section, which related to narcotic goods provided:

""Special provision with respect to narcotic goods:

(1)Any person who:

...

(d)aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or is in any way knowingly concerned in, the importation, or bringing, into Australia of any prohibited imports to which this section applies ...

...

shall be guilty of an offence.""

22The Chief Justice found further support for confining the meaning of ""imports"" in s 307.11 from the decisions of the High Court in Forbes v Traders' Finance Corporation Ltd (1971) 126 CLR 429 and R v Bull (1974) 131 CLR 203. In Forbes Barwick CJ distinguished between the word ""import"" and the word ""importation"" in s 229(j) of the Customs Act, which was concerned with the forfeiture of goods used in ""the unlawful importation ... of any goods."" Although his Honour was not concerned with defining the reach of the word ""import"", his Honour distinguished it from the word ""importation"" which (at 432) his Honour said ""extends on both sides of the actual act of importing goods into the country. The importation does not cease at the moment of an import.""

23The correctness of Campbell was not argued before this Court. If the issue was to arise it may be necessary to consider whether Barwick CJ should be understood to have confined the reach of the offence of ""importing"" contrary to the Act, giving it a lesser reach than the enterprise being the ""importation"" in which the central act is that of importing. However, Campbell will not arise for reconsideration because the legislature has since that decision amended the Act to overcome the difficulty to which the decision gave rise.

24The decisions in Calderwood and Campbell were considered by the Full Court of South Australia in R v Toe (2010) 106 SASR 203; (2010]) 199 A Crim R 347 at [42]. The majority were critical of the decision in Calderwood, saying that they preferred the analysis in Campbell. Toe was another case concerned with the construction of the Criminal Code and not the Customs Act. In Campbell Spigelman CJ was careful to identify this difference, saying at:

""The reasoning in Calderwood uses the terminology of 'importing' as equivalent to 'importation', as explained in this line of authority: see, for example, at 212 [12]. The case was, however, concerned with s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act (Cth) and not s 307.11 of the Code.

The word 'importing' is not used in s 307.11.""

25When construing a statute it is always necessary to look at the context in which a particular word or expression appears: CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408.

26Section 233B(1)(d) provided, until it was repealed, the ""aiding and abetting"" offence in respect of the importation of prohibited imports that were narcotic drugs. The primary offence was provided by s 233B(1)(b), which made it an offence to ""import"" any ""prohibited import."" Section 233B(1)(d) was confined to prohibited imports which are narcotic drugs. However, it is plain to my mind that the importation (the noun) referred to in s 233B(1)(d) was the broad activity which involved the act of importing contemplated in s 233B(1)(b). The distinction identified by Barwick CJ in Forbes is not available in relation to the relevant provisions of s 233B(1)(b) and s 233B(1)(d).

27The issue which required resolution in Calderwood was the relevance of evidence of later activity to support the prosecution case that Calderwood was guilty of a breach of s 233B(1)(b). Section 233B of the Customs Act has since been repealed. The relevant accessorial liability provisions are now contained in the Code, and the offence provision is found in s 233BAA(4) of the Customs Act. However, in the scheme of the legislation as it previously was it would make no sense to provide an ""aiding and abetting"" offence which covered a broader range of conduct than the primary offence. In the context of s 233B(1) the distinction between importing (the verb) and the importation (the noun) is to my mind entirely illusory. I did not deal with the issue in Calderwood. It was not raised, for the obvious reason that neither party believed it to be an issue.

28In the present case the respondent was charged with an offence contrary to s 233BAA(4) of the Customs Act. That section provides that it is an offence to have ""intentionally imported goods"", provided that their ""importation"" was relevantly prohibited under the Act. To my mind the meaning of the word ""imported"" in the section is plain. The section does not contemplate that there can be separate behaviour being an ""importation"" which is an offence beyond the prohibited ""importing"" of goods. The noun ""importation"" in sub-section (c) refers to the event to which the verb ""imported"" refers. For this reason the authorities which I followed in Calderwood and the approach that I took in that case is in my view applicable to the proper construction of s 233BAA(4).

29The accessorial liability provision in s 11.2 of the Code now refers to ""a person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence"", whereas s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act referred to any person who ""aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or is in any way knowingly concerned in, the importation, or bringing, into Australia of any prohibited imports to which this section applies.""

30I do not agree with the suggestion by Bleby J in Toe (at 218) that importation in the context of s 233B(1) of the Customs Act referred to a broad process of importation only because of the phrase ""knowingly concerned in the importation"" in s 233B(1)(d), as well as the surrounding words in that section. As Gleeson CJ pointed out in Leff at 214:

""[t]he concepts of importation, and of being concerned in an importation, are both sufficiently flexible [to capture conduct beyond the specific act of importing].""

31The replacement of s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act with s 11.2 of the Code (which, being a generic provision, does not refer to importation at all) does not have the effect that importing for the purposes of s 233BAA(4) now refers narrowly to the act of importing. There is no indication that Parliament intended to make such a fundamental change to the offence. Rather, Parliament's intention was merely to bring the Customs Act into harmony with the accessorial liability provisions in the Code. In any event, a change to an accessorial liability provision cannot enlarge or reduce the scope of the offence to which it applies.

32To the contrary, the offence provision itself refers to a person who ""intentionally imported"" goods as well as to the ""importation"" of the goods in sub-section (c). The use of the verb ""import"" and the noun ""importation"" within the same offence provision suggests that there is no material difference between the word ""imported"" and the broader process of importation discussed in Calderwood.

33The more significant issue in the present case is whether the respondent could be convicted of aiding and abetting an offence contrary to s 233BAA(4)(a), when, by the time he became involved in the activity said to be the importation, the drugs had been confiscated and substituted with flour.

34There are previous decisions in circumstances where an offender has intended to import a prohibited substance but unbeknown to him the substance which was imported was not prohibited. In Britten v Albogut (1987) 23 A Crim R 254, where the offender sought to import cannabis but in fact, when the suitcase used for the purpose was examined, the substance was found to be procaine (which was not prohibited), the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria held that the offender could only be guilty of an attempt to commit the offence, the offender believing that the substance he was importing was the prohibited drug. 

35In this State the issue was considered in R v Mai (1992) 26 NSWLR 371. This Court applied the approach of the Victorian Full Court, concluding that in circumstances where it was physically impossible for an accused to commit a particular crime, an attempt to commit that crime has nevertheless been established if the conclusion is available:

1.That the accused intended to do the acts with the relevant state of mind which together would comprise the intended crime (that is, if the facts and circumstances had been as he believed them to be, he would have committed that crime), and

2.That, with that intention, he did some act towards the commission of that crime which went beyond mere preparation and which cannot reasonably be regarded as having any purpose other than the commission of that crime.

36Mai was followed by this Court in R v Onuorah [2009] NSWCCA 238; (2009) 76 NSWLR 1. 

37To my mind the conclusion of the trial judge in the present case was correct. Although the acts of Simpson, including his retrieval of the furniture items, were acts in furtherance of the primary offence, by the time the respondent became involved it was impossible for the respondent to do any act which could ""aid, abet, counsel or procure"" the commission of that offence. Although I would conclude that the respondent intended by his actions to assist Simpson to take possession of the drugs, this was made impossible by their substitution with flour (Simpson, of course, was implicated in the primary offence because of his role as the importer before the drugs were substituted with flour). It may be, as the trial judge identified, that the respondent could have been successfully charged with an attempt to commit an offence, probably the offence of attempting to possess. But his actions could not constitute the offence of aiding and abetting the importation of the drugs.

38In my judgment, the appeal should be dismissed.

39ROTHMAN J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of McClellan CJ at CL and the orders that are proposed. I agree with the orders he proposes, but for different reasons.

40As stated the facts were not in dispute and it is unnecessary to reiterate them or much of the analysis. For the following reasons, it is relevant that Mr Simpson took delivery of items, which he understood contained pseudoephedrine and which, when their journey began, did contain the banned import. Authorities intercepted the banned substance, and substituted flour for it.

41The charge against Mr Nolan, as explained by the Chief Judge at Common Law, was an offence under the Criminal Code (Cth), being aiding and abetting an offence. If a person aided and abetted the commission of an offence (hereinafter ""the principal offence""), the person is taken to have committed the principal offence.

42In this case the principal offence is a breach of s 233BAA of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The relevant provisions of both the Criminal Code and the Customs Act are set out in the reasons for judgment of McClellan CJ at CL.

Principles applicable to aiding and abetting

43A person, who aids and abets the commission of an offence, at common law and under the Criminal Code is guilty of the offence of aiding and abetting. Often the person aiding and abetting is referred to as a ""principal in the second degree"", as distinct from the ""principal in the first degree"", being the person, or persons, who has actually committed the principal offence, including persons who have committed the offence as part of a joint criminal enterprise: see generally Osland v R [1998] HCA 75, (1998) 197 CLR 316; Giorgianni v R (1985) 156 CLR 473 at 480, 493.

44In order to aid and abet the offence, a person must be present at the commission of the principal offence, i.e. within sight and sound of the commission of the offence: R v Betts & Ridley (1930) 22 Cr App Rep 148. Presence can also be constructive, meaning when a person stands by and is ready and able to render assistance if and when requested: R v Dorrey & Gage [1970] 3 NSWLR 351 at 353. Presence, either actual or constructive, is an essential, but not sufficient condition for the existence of aiding and abetting. In other words, mere presence, without more, will not give rise to the offence of aiding and abetting. 

45In order for a person, to be guilty of the offence of aiding and abetting, the person must have encouraged or assisted with the commission of the principal offence: Osland, supra. In that sense the liability of a person who has aided and abetted, is derivative. The conviction of an accused for aiding and abetting requires, in the proceedings on that charge, proof, beyond reasonable doubt, of the commission of the principal offence.

46Where, as here, the encouragement and assistance is alleged to have been given by way of assistance to a particular person, then it is necessary that the guilt of that person be proved in order for aiding and abetting to be proved: Osland, supra. This does not mean that the conviction of the principal offender is a necessary condition for the conviction of the offender in the second degree, but the guilt of the principal offender must be proved in the aiding and abetting trial, in order for the guilt of the offender in the second degree to be established.

47A person who assists or encourages the commission of an offence, but is not either actually or constructively present at its commission, may be guilty of another offence, for example, accessory before the fact. Other than its existence for theoretical purposes and an understanding of the charges against Mr Nolan, the principles applicable to accessory before the fact offences are irrelevant for present purposes.

48Similarly, an offence arising from being an accessory after the fact may occur when an accessory assists the principal in the first degree to avoid detection, apprehension or conviction after the offence has been committed. Both accessory before the fact and accessory after the fact, like aiding and abetting, are derivative offences, i.e. they depend on the commission of the principal offence. Mr Nolan was not charged with accessory charges (either before or after the fact).

The circumstances of this offence

49As already stated by McClellan CJ at CL, the pseudoephedrine landed in Brisbane and travelled to Sydney, at which point customs officers intercepted it.

50After interception, the shipping agent delivered it to Western Sydney, where Mr Simpson was to take delivery. Mr Nolan assisted Mr Simpson in this task by collecting him from the airport, taking him to the Western Sydney address and conducting ""counter surveillance"" to protect the item until it was collected by Mr Simpson.

51Whether there is a case against Mr Nolan for aiding and abetting Mr Simpson, depends upon whether Mr Simpson was still engaged in the principal offence at the time that the assistance was rendered. It also depends on Mr Nolan's state of knowledge of the principal offence.

Was Mr Simpson still involved in the principal offence?

52The terms of s 233BAA(4) of the Customs Act is recited at [13] in the reasons for judgment of McClellan CJ at CL. There is no doubt, on the evidence in this case, that Mr Simpson ""intentionally imported goods"" of the relevant kind, namely pseudoephedrine (hereinafter ""the substance"").

53The trial judge took the view that Mr Nolan could not have been guilty of aiding and abetting, because the substance had been intercepted, was no longer being handled by the principal offender (Mr Simpson), or on his behalf, and therefore the principal offence was complete at the time of interception and replacement.

54As McClellan CJ at CL makes clear, the correctness of that finding depends upon the point in time that Mr Simpson was no longer committing the principal offence. There is no doubt that, because the substance did land in Australia and Mr Simpson had imported it, Mr Simpson had committed an offence pursuant to s 233BAA(4).

55Further, Mr Simpson would have committed that offence even if he had been arrested in Brisbane and had never taken delivery of the substance in Sydney.

56The issue is whether after the interception of the substance, and its substitution for flour, Mr Simpson was still involved in committing the offence. A person who does no more than meet a courier at an airport and take delivery of a substance (after being involved in arranging for the courier to bring the substance) has committed an act, which, together with other acts, imported the goods into Australia.

57Where, as here, a shipping agent is used, the conduct giving rise to the offence is continuing until the importer takes delivery of the substance. Mr Simpson was to have taken delivery of the substance in Western Sydney with the assistance of Mr Nolan.

58The provisions describing the offence with which Mr Nolan was charged are different from those examined in either Campbell v R (2008) 73 NSWLR 272 or Calderwood v R [2007] NSWCCA 180; (2007) 172 A Crim R 208. First, as in Calderwood, but not Campbell, the Customs Act established the principal offence. Secondly, s 233B of the Customs Act uses both ""imported"" and ""importation"", albeit in a slightly different context. Thirdly, the terms of the principal offence, even under the Customs Act are different to the provisions that were relevant in Campbell and Calderwood.

59Some fundamental issues should be reiterated. A statute should be read as a whole and the terms of the statute construed in context to achieve harmonious goals consistent with the purpose of the legislation: Project Blue Sky v ABA [1998] HCA 28, (1998) 194 CLR 355; K&S Lake City Freighters Pty Ltd v Gordon & Gotch Ltd (1985) 157 CLR 309.

60In R v Bull (1974) 131 CLR 203, Barwick CJ discussed the application of the Customs Act to the situation where, when the accused perceived they were being discovered, the accused, who had arrived inside Australian territorial waters but had not landed in port, dumped the prohibited goods (cannabis) at sea. The Chief Justice stated:

""The question is not what constitutes importation in an abstract or universal sense: the question is when, according to the provisions of the Act, are goods imported into Australia? However, in general, importation of goods, in my opinion, according to the natural meaning of the word, involves landing them, or bringing them within a port for the purpose of landing them in the country or place in relation to which importation is regulated"" (at 212).

61It is noteworthy that in Bull, Barwick CJ noted that landing the prohibited goods was, in accordance with the natural meaning of ""importation"" or ""imports"", a necessary aspect. His Honour did not suggest that ""landing"" the goods was the point at which the importation of the goods ceased. His Honour had recourse to the then statutory scheme embodied in the Customs Act.

62With great respect to Spigelman CJ in Campbell (at [67]) (with whom Weinberg AJA and Simpson J agreed), Barwick CJ was not deciding when the act of ""importation"" commences; he was determining a circumstance that was necessary before conduct could amount to ""importation"". The importation, if it were to occur, would have ""commenced"" well before landing the goods.

63In Campbell, this Court construed the provisions of the Criminal Code and specifically distinguished (at [100]) the judgment of this Court in Calderwood on the basis that in Calderwood, the Court was construing the Customs Act at a time when the context of the words was different.

64Likewise, the context of the provision imposing the principal offence relevant to these proceedings is the Customs Act. That context has changed slightly since the analysis of the High Court in R v Bull, which alterations should be noted, at least where most relevant.

65Imported goods are, subject to certain exceptions, governed by provisions which allow the owner of goods to declare whether the goods are either for warehousing or for home consumption before landing, and, if the owner were not to do so, these provisions require the owner to do so after landing. The provisions extend the concern of an official operating under the Customs Act to activities of the owner until and immediately after delivery to the owner.

66In Calderwood, the Court construed, as has been stated, the provisions of the Customs Act, in particular, s 233B(1)(b) thereof (hereinafter ""the Calderwood Provision""). 

67The Calderwood Provision imposed liability, inter alia, on ""a person who imports"" narcotics. The provision was amended later in 2004 and ultimately repealed and replaced by a separate regime for narcotics introduced by the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Act 2005.

68As can be seen from the recital of the provisions applicable to the principal offence in the current matter, liability arises ""if [a] person intentionally imported goods"", and ""their importation was prohibited... absolutely; or... [without] approval... [being] obtained... at the time of the importation"". The other aspects and conditions on the application of s 233BAA(4) of the Customs Act are currently irrelevant.

Interpreting s 233BAA(4)

69Subject to a particular context, words are generally interpreted consistently in a statute. In Williamson Pty Ltd v Barrowcliff [1915] VLR 450, Hodges J said:

""I think it is a fundamental rule of construction that any document should be construed as far as possible so as to give the same meaning to the same words wherever those words occur in that document, and that that applies especially to an Act of Parliament, and with especial force to words contained in the same section of an Act. There ought to be very strong reasons present before the Court holds that words in one part of a section have a different meaning from the same words appearing in another part of the same section.""

As is clear from the above citation the principle of consistency in meaning has even more force where similar words are used in the same provision.

70Generally and subject to context, where a word has a particular meaning, other grammatical forms of that word have a corresponding meaning: s 18A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth). In Campbell, the Court distinguished the word ""imports"", where used as a verb, from the term ""importation""; the latter, it was said, being a process. In s 233BAA(4), the past tense of the verb, namely the word ""imported' is used in the same provision as the word ""importation"".

71The task undertaken by the Court is directed to ascertaining the ""natural"" meaning of the expression where used in the provision.

72In R v Lam (1990) 46 A Crim R 402, Gleeson CJ (with whom Kirby P and Newman J agreed) dealt with a charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation of a quantity of heroin. The Chief Justice cited the judgment of Barwick CJ and Windeyer J in Forbes v Traders Finance Corporation Ltd (1971) 126 CLR 429 to the effect that ""importation extends on both sides of the actual act of importing... the importation does not cease at the moment of an import"". Gleeson CJ said, ""The term 'importation' is one that must involve at least some measure of flexibility"".

73In R v Courtney-Smith (No 2) (1990) 48 A Crim R 49, the Court (Kirby P, Sharpe J and Lusher AJ) dealt with a submission that ""importation"" ceased when the goods were landed. The Court said:

""There are two answers to this argument: one legal and the other factual. The legal answer is that it simply is not sustained either by the language and purpose of the Act or by authority which has collected around its meaning. The relevant provisions of the Customs Act were enacted to give effect to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. Its clear purpose is to strike at the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and their penetration of the Australian society. Because Australia is an island, that penetration will normally occur through importation of such drugs. Therefore, a section addressed simply to the act of landing would not only fail to exhaust in a proper and understandable way the relevant Federal head of power. It would also fail to achieve the plain objective of preventing importation by attacking those within Australia who become concerned in the arranging the act of importation and in moving the goods, once imported, into the community where they do their mischief. 

Legal authority, both of the High Court of Australia and of this Court supports that construction of the word ""importation"". In Forbes v Traders Finance Limited (1970) 126 CLR 429 at 432, Barwick CJ said: ""'[I]mportation' extends on both sides of the actual act of importing into the country. The importation does not cease at the moment of an import. But the relevant use of a vehicle must be proximate to the act of importing. Whether it is so or not is a question of degree for decision in the particular case."" That question of degree has been clarified by a succession of cases in which meaning has been given to the term. Thus in The Queen v Bull and Ors (1974) 131 CLR 203, it was held that goods on a ship still at sea, but within the three miles of the coast of the Northern Territory, had not been ""imported"" into Australia within the meaning of the Act until they had been landed and brought within the limits of the port with the intention of landing them. A conviction for importing prohibited goods was therefore held to be bad. The present appellant latched onto that judgment to assert that importation meant landing. But that is not the holding of Bull. That decision was addressed to a fact situation very different from that presently before the Court. There, the goods had not actually entered the country. In the instant case, the goods had undoubtedly done so. Accordingly, the holding in Bull was not determinative of the question before this Court.

Neither Commonwealth power nor the language of the Customs Act will follow the goods once they are imported, without limitation as to time and place. A time will be reached when involvement with them in their passage through the Australian community cannot properly be categorized as knowing concern in their ""importation"". Likewise, innocent transport of goods after their arrival, although amounting to concern in their importation in one sense, will not have the character of criminality to which the section is addressed. None of this is relevant to the facts of the present case. Nor is the narrow and technical construction of ""importation"" urged by the appellant compatible with a series of holdings of this and other courts about the scope and duration of the ""importation"" with which knowing concern must be shown. For example in R v Shin Nan Yong (1975) 7 ALR 271, this Court made it plain that it was not necessary, to secure a conviction under s233B(1)(d) that the ""concern"" should be made manifest in a physical sense whilst the importation was actually in progress. It was sufficient if the ""concern"" is manifested in the venture which centred upon the importation.""

74In R v Sukkar [2005] NSWCCA 54, the Court again considered the extent of ""importation"" as part of a charge of being ""knowingly concerned"". This charge, by use of the term ""knowingly concerned"", broadens the conduct with which the offence is concerned: see Campbell, per Weinberg AJA.

75The Court in Sukkar (Wood CJ at CL with whom Hidden J and, relevantly, Smart AJ agreed) said:

""[118] Of some importance in relation to the asserted absence of any evidence of the Appellant's knowing involvement in the importation, was the defence submission that the columns had been unloaded, and all of the tablets removed before the Appellant arrived at the premises on the morning of 2 December. That was associated with his submission that the time of removal of the tablets, either on 24 November or on 2 December, marked the end of the process of importation.

[119] Absent any evidence showing positively that the Appellant had a financial interest in the importation, and absent any direct evidence of activity connected with the venture on his part before 24 November, I would accept the Appellant's submission that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt of his knowing concern in the importation prior to that date. While the evidence would give rise to a strong suspicion of his earlier involvement, that would not suffice to support a conviction on that basis.

[120] The prosecution case however does not depend upon the Appellant having been knowingly concerned in the importation before 24 November, or of having a financial interest in it. Its case was that the process of importation continued thereafter and that the conduct, on that day and subsequently, of the Appellant amounted to a knowing concern on his part.

[121] On my assessment that submission is correct having regard to the extended concept involved in the process of importation which includes recovery of the goods after landing and anything which is done having a direct proximity to the bringing of the goods into the country, and making them available including their clearance and transfer into storage, unpacking, and arranging for payment of those involved in the process, that is the suppliers, shippers, customs agents, freight forwarders, and so on.""

76His Honour, Smart AJ, summarised the principles that had emerged from the authorities as including:

""[157] I agree with the Chief Judge that the evidence was not sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that prior to 24 November 2001 the appellant was knowingly concerned in the importation of narcotic goods consisting of not less than a commercial quantity of ecstasy tablets. The critical question is whether it was reasonably open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was knowingly concerned in an importation from 24 November 2001 to 5 December 2001 or part of that period. These principles emerge from the authorities.

(a)""Importation"" extends on both sides of the actual act of importing into the country The term ""importation"" involves some measure of flexibility. See per Barwick CJ in Forbes v Traders Finance Ltd, 126 CLR 429 at 432 and Gleeson CJ in R v Lam (1990) 46 A Crim R 402.

(b)The important question is not so much the precise meaning and application of the word ""importation"" as the meaning and application of the phrase ""knowingly concerned in the importation"". See per Gleeson CJ in R v Lam.

(c)The word ""concerned"" is one of general import and it is impossible to state with precision what it comprehends. Regard must be had to the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The concept of being concerned in the importation is one of some flexibility. The word ""involved"" is often given as a synonym for ""concerned"". See per Gleeson CJ in Lam.

(d)Importation means more than ""landing"". The prohibition against being knowingly concerned (or involved) in the importation of narcotic goods covers those within Australia who become concerned in arranging the importation and in moving the goods, once imported, into the community. See R v Courtney-Smith (No 2) (1990) 48 A Crim R 49.

(e)A time will be reached when involvement with narcotic goods in their passage through the Australian community cannot properly be categorised as knowing concern in their ""importation"". See R v Courtney-Smith (No 2).

(f)Innocent collection, transport or handling of goods after their arrival or providing a place for their permanent or temporary storage, although amounting to concern in their importation in one sense, will not be criminal. See R v Courtney-Smith.

(g)The concern does not have to be made manifest in a physical sense while the importation is taking place. It is sufficient if the ""concern"" is manifested in the venture which centred upon the importation.

(h)If imported narcotic goods are still in a container and held in a hired factory or storage facility before distribution to the intended markets they are still in the state of importation. See R v Lam.

(i)Importation is a venture or process not a physical act which occurs or ceases at the moment of import. Intervention by the authorities, for example, seizing the goods, does not prevent that process or venture from continuing and a person might subsequently become concerned in the importation. See R v Leff (1996) 86 A Crim R 212 per James J and per Gleeson CJ.

(j)Concern in an importation can commence at a time when it has apparently broken down and where efforts are being made to bring it to fruition. See per Gleeson CJ in Leff.

(k)Where narcotic goods are imported into Australia in the voids of pieces of machinery or equipment the act of importation embraces the removal of those narcotic goods from such pieces of machinery and equipment and attempts to do so.""

77In Sukkar, the Court relied, inter alia, on the judgment of the Court in R v Leff (1996) 132 FLR 102; (1996) 86 A Crim R 212. In the course of agreeing with James J, Gleeson CJ (Allen J agreeing with both Gleeson CJ and James J) said (at 2):

""Raz was merely a courier. The venture of importation to which he lent himself involved the consignment of cocaine from principals in the United States to Kissner in Sydney. Raz, with the cocaine strapped to his body, was to be met by Kissner at Sydney airport and taken to a place where he would hand the cocaine over to Kissner. From the point of view of the importer, Kissner, the importation would end when he received the cocaine from Raz.
Because of the interception by the authorities, before Raz cleared customs, he did not make contact with Kissner at the airport.
Later on 21 July, when, on her story, the appellant became involved, Raz telephoned her to say he had not been met at the airport. (Why Raz would have telephoned her, and spoken to her in the manner recorded by the surveillance, if she had not previously been involved is hard to imagine).

At that stage the venture of importation was incomplete. It had been interrupted by the authorities. Raz had not been able to make contact with Kissner, and the authorities had taken the cocaine, which he was to deliver to Kissner, from him.
The principal argument for the appellant comes down to the proposition that at that stage it was impossible for her to become knowingly concerned in the importation; the importation was over. I am unable to accept that argument. The concepts of importation, and of being concerned in an importation, are both sufficiently flexible to cover a case such as the present. As the authorities referred to by James J show, importation is a process, or a venture, not a physical act which occurs or ceases at the moment of import. Furthermore, concern in an importation can commence at a time when it has apparently broken down, and where efforts are being made to bring it to fruition.""

78In the same case James J said:

""It is true that in the present case Raz was arrested at the airport and the cocaine being carried by him was seized by the Federal Police. However, I do not consider that the intervention by the authorities prevented the process or venture of importation from continuing so that a person might subsequently become concerned in the importation. In R v Chow (1987) 11 NSWLR 561 this Court held that the appellant had been rightly convicted of being in possession of prohibited imports being heroin, in a case where before the appellant had a meeting with the courier who had brought the heroin into Australia in a suitcase, police had entered the motel room where the courier was staying, taken possession of most of the heroin and substituted plaster of Paris blocks in the suitcase.

In the present case, there was evidence that after some of the telephone conversations with the appellant had taken place, Kissner was still taking steps with a view to obtaining delivery of the cocaine.""

79Again the offence considered in the judgment in Leff was being ""knowingly concerned"" in the importation, rather than ""importing"". It is therefore necessary to re-examine the judgment in Calderwood.

80In Calderwood the appellant was unrepresented. The charge considered by the Court was, as has been stated, a charge under s 233B of the Customs Act, which provision has since been repealed. The offence was committed, relevantly, ""if... the person... imports""[sic] narcotics.

81The word ""imports"" in what was then s 233B of the Customs Act was used as a verb, not as a noun; nor did the legislature utilise a participle or gerundive in this provision. The word must be understood within the context of the Customs Act, where it seems to imply a process, rather than a single act: starting with the goods' journey from outside Australia and concluding with the goods' landing in Australia (or even clearance at customs).

82In Campbell, the reasons for judgment in Calderwood were, as has been said, distinguished on the basis that the charge in Campbell arose under the Criminal Code, not the Customs Act. The offence under the Criminal Code was in wording, as distinct from context, relevantly identical to that in Calderwood in that it prescribed that a person committed an offence ""if the person imports [sic]... a substance"".

83In Campbell, the Court was not dealing with a charge of being ""knowingly concerned"". The Court took the view that the substance had been imported and the physical conduct giving rise to the offence was completed before the container was unpacked. As the Crown case in Campbell permitted a conviction based on the formation of an intention after the physical conduct had ended, and, as it was necessary for both physical and mental elements to exist at the one time, the conviction could not stand. A new trial was ordered.

84The Court in Campbell, distinguished Calderwood, Sukkar, Bull, and Wilson v Chambers (1926) 38 CLR 131, amongst other cases, on the basis that the issue they dealt with was the extent of ""importation"" rather than ""imports"" or, as in the cases of Calderwood and Bull, on the basis that, even though the word ""imports"" was used, it was in the context of the Customs Act, the statutory scheme of which required the term to be given the same flexibility as the term ""importation"": see particularly Campbell at [52] - [60].

85The Court of Criminal Appeal in South Australia considered the above issues in Toe v R (2010) 106 SASR 203; [2010] SASC 39, which judgment was issued on 26 February 2010. In the Toe proceeding, the impugned conduct of the accused occurred in May 2007 and the trial concluded with guilty verdicts in May 2009. The SA Court (Bleby and White JJ with Gray J dissenting) preferred the analysis in Campbell and disapproved of the approach in Calderwood.

86The offences subject to charge in Toe were identical to those in Campbell and arose under the Code. At [46] of Toe, Bleby J noted that it was significant that the Court in Calderwood relied on a line of authority in which no judgment dealt with an offence involving ""import into Australia"", but rather dealt with being ""knowingly concerned in importation"". That comment, with great respect to Bleby J, ignores the judgment of the High Court in Bull, relied on by the Court in Calderwood and distinguished by this Court in Campbell.

87In Bull, the High Court decided that, in circumstances where the drugs were ""dumped"" at sea to prevent detection, there had been no person who had imported the drugs because importing required landing on the unsubmerged land mass of Australia. On one view, to which I do not subscribe, the discussion on the meaning of ""imports"" in Bull is obiter dicta, at least in part. Nevertheless, it is considered in detail by the High Court and, at least in the context of an offence under the Customs Act, it is, and should be, binding on this Court: see Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; (2007) 230 CLR 89.

88I note that, following the publication of the judgment in Campbell, and just prior to the publication of the judgment in Toe, the Criminal Code was amended, effective 20 February 2010, to include, in the definition of ""import"", ""deal[ing] with the substance in connection with its importation"". Whatever were the limits applicable to the use of the word ""imports"", as distinct from ""importation"", at the time of the alleged offences in Campbell and Toe, those limitations did not apply as at April 2010, when the alleged conduct in this charge was said to occur, even if the principal offence were an offence under s 307.11 of the Code.

89As a consequence of the foregoing analysis, binding authority is to the effect that the term ""imports"", where used in the Customs Act, includes conduct beyond the landing of the goods and, in the words of Wood CJ at CL in Sukkar, supra at [121], ""includes recovery of the goods after landing and anything ... done having a direct proximity to the bringing of the goods into the country, and making them available including their clearance and transfer into storage, unpacking, and arranging for payment of those involved in the process, that is suppliers, shippers, customs agents, freight forwarders, and so on"".

90It would seem, following the amendment to definitions of ""import"" in the Code, that an offence involving ""importing"", even under the Code, would have the same degree of flexibility. It is unnecessary to decide that issue in these proceedings.

91It is sufficient to find that the natural meaning of ""imported"" in the Customs Act includes the owner or importer taking delivery of the goods. Whether it would include another person, not otherwise involved in the importation, taking delivery will depend upon a range of factors. The term is a flexible one, but not infinitely variable.

92As a consequence of my view of the law and of the proper construction of ""imported"" in s 233BAA of the Customs Act, Mr Simpson was, subject to the issue of the substitution of flour for the substance, still engaging in the conduct that was part of the process by which the substance was ""imported"" and thus he was engaged in committing the offence.

93Once that proposition is accepted, the substitution of flour for the substance has no effect on the criminality of the conduct in which Mr Simpson was engaged when he took delivery of the furniture in which the substance was originally secreted. It is sufficient to refer to the passage from the judgment of Gleeson CJ, recited above, in Leff, in which the Court was dealing with precisely those circumstances.

94""The concept of importation"" is ""sufficiently flexible to cover a case such as the present"". While the Court, in this case, is not dealing with ""knowing concern"" which, according to Gleeson CJ, may commence after the importation has apparently broken down, the Court, in examining the principal offence, is dealing with a principal offender who, in fact, imported the substance into Australia and was still acting to effect (i.e. take delivery of) that importation.

The role of Nolan

95Having examined the principles set forth earlier in this judgment that relate to aiding and abetting the commission of the principal offence in light of the foregoing analysis of the principal offence, the following aspects become important to note. First, at the time Mr Nolan became involved in conduct assisting Mr Simpson, the latter was still involved in the commission of the principal offence. Secondly, Mr Nolan was present while that aspect of the offence was being committed. Thirdly, Mr Nolan's conduct assisted and/or encouraged Mr Simpson in taking delivery of the drugs.

96The inference is clearly available on the evidence before the Court that Mr Nolan knew his conduct would be of assistance or would encourage the commission of an offence involving drugs. Of itself, that knowledge would not be sufficient to prove guilt.

97Does that knowledge extend beyond that described in the immediately preceding paragraph? What, in other words, is the evidence that Mr Nolan was aware an importation was being effected?

98The only evidence of Mr Nolan's knowledge of the process being undertaken is the content of the text message set forth in the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL at [7], namely, to the effect, that Mr Simpson was 

""In air now. Box opened. All sweet. Get yr mates ready."" [sic].

99For an offence to be committed under the Code, the fault and physical elements must be in existence at the same time: Campbell at [137], per Weinberg AJA, with whom Spigelman CJ and Simpson J agreed. In that respect the Code reflects the common law.

100The Crown case did not suggest extended common purpose (that is, recklessness as to some other offence) and in order to be found guilty, Mr Nolan must have intended that his conduct assist or encourage the process of importing.

101In determining, as did the trial judge in these proceedings, to direct a verdict of acquittal, a trial judge must be satisfied that there is no evidence upon which a jury, directed in accordance with law, could properly convict: Doney v R [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 212. A court, in arriving at such a decision, must ignore contradictory evidence unfavourable to the Crown case and must take the Crown case at its highest, including any inferences that may arise from the evidence adduced: R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74 at 81, per Gleeson CJ.

102It is not for the trial judge, in such an exercise, to assess the unreasonableness of any guilty verdict that may eventuate. Nor is the judge to direct merely because a reasonable hypothesis inconsistent with guilt is available: R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39. If inferences are available from the evidence adduced that are both consistent and inconsistent with guilt, it is for the jury (not the trial judge), properly instructed, to decide which inference to accept.

103Where an inference consistent with guilt cannot be drawn, it is for the trial judge to direct. The drawing of an inference is a matter of common sense: Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 300-321; Fabre v Arenales (1992) 27 NSWLR 437 at 445. In criminal law, the inference will be drawn from proved facts where ""general human experience would be contradicted if the proved facts were unaccompanied by the act sought to be proved"": Morgan v Babcock & Wilcox Ltd (1929) 43 CLR 163 at 173, per Knox CJ and Dixon J; cited in Fabre v Arenales, supra, at 445.

104Would general human experience be contradicted if, having received the text message recited above, Mr Nolan were unaware that he was facilitating an importation of drugs, as distinct from, say, a subsequent distribution within Australia, for example, from Brisbane to Sydney or from Sydney onward. In my view, it would not.

105The jury would have been asked to conjecture. No evidence was available from which the jury could have been entitled to draw the inference that Mr Nolan knew he was assisting Mr Simpson in the importing process. As a consequence, for reasons different from the trial judge and from McClellan CJ at CL, I also consider that a directed verdict was available.

Appeal consequences

106I have come to the view that the trial judge had the power to direct a verdict of acquittal, but for different reasons than those relied upon by the trial judge. The jurisdiction of this Court is confined, under s 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, to a ground of appeal ""that involves a question of law alone"".

107The right to appeal in the case of a directed verdict is a most unusual one: R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256 at [24]-[25]. Ordinarily, the question of whether there is evidence on which a jury could convict is a question of law: R v R, supra, Krishna v DPP [2007] NSWCCA 318 at [44]-[46]; Alramadan v DPP [2007] NSWCCA 322 at [68]-[69] and the cases cited therein.

108However, if that were the kind of question of law to which the legislature was referring, every acquittal by direction could be appealed and the words ""on any ground that involves a question of law alone"" would be wholly otiose.

109Further, if every decision that involved an assessment of fact were excluded from appeal by use of the word ""alone"", then no, or almost no, directed verdict could be subject to appeal. Except those acquittals directed because, as a matter of law, the charge, cannot arise (e.g. a demurrer or point that would have permitted discharge of the indictment at the outset of the trial), all acquittals by direction involve an assessment of facts proved and inferences available. Again, but on this occasion for the reason that no appeal could be taken, the provision would be otiose.

110In my view, in context and bearing in mind both the purpose of the provision and the necessity to give validity and effect to the provision and meaning to all the words thereof, a ""ground that involves a question of law alone"", in this context, is a ground that relies on an error of law within the reasons for directing the verdict and that error, of itself, if corrected, could determine the appeal.

111In this case, on my view, there was such an error when the trial judge, on the basis of undisputed facts, determined that the principal offence was concluded prior to Mr Nolan's involvement. The assessment involved an error of law in the construction and extent of the term ""imported"".

112The terms of s 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act specify (s 107(5)) that the Court may affirm or quash the acquittal. Nevertheless, as the Court noted in R v PL, there is a residual discretion as to the appropriate orders to be made: R v PL, supra, at [93]. In this case, an acquittal by direction was available, but for different reasons. Even if it were not, a guilty verdict would depend on a finding that the fault element co-existed with Mr Nolan's conduct. Such a verdict would be unreasonable.

113As a consequence of the forgoing, I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL, the effect of which is that the acquittal is affirmed.

114DAVIES J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

2417411,R v WILLMOTT [2012] NSWSC 824,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
1Kelvin Robert Willmott pleads guilty to the murder of Shane Curphey on 13 October 2010. The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A standard non-parole period has been prescribed of 20 years imprisonment. These two legislative guideposts are to be borne in mind when the Court comes to a consideration of the appropriate penalty, having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective features of the offender: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. The standard non-parole period does not have determinative significance in sentencing the offender: Muldrock at [31], nor is it a ""starting point"" for the sentence, nor does it directly apply as the offender has pleaded guilty. 
2Shane Curphey died as a result of the infliction by the offender of numerous knife wounds, predominately to the neck and the left side of the chest. He was 35 years old when he was murdered. 
3A statement of facts agreed between the Crown and the offender was tendered by consent and formed part of exhibit A. The agreed facts are: 

""1. The Waterfront Tourist Park is a caravan and tourist park located inBeach Parade, Canton Beach on the NSW Central Coast. Thislocation caters for permanent and semi-permanent residents, aswell as visitors.
2. The Offender, Kelvin WILLMOTT, had been residing with hismother, Roberta 'Bobbie' WILLMOTT, in a caravan within the parksince May 2010. The Offender's two brothers also reside within thecaravan park.
3. The Deceased, Shane CURPHEY, was not a resident of theWaterfront Tourist Park however he was a regular visitor as he hadfriends within the park. The Deceased is distinctly identifiable by hisphysical stature and appearance as he was 193cm tall and wore hishair in a long pony tail.
4. On the morning of Wednesday 13 October 2010, Daniel CURDS, aresident of the caravan park, who is an alcoholic, began drinking ataround 8 am. His friend Jodie MURRAY, another caravan parkresident, came to his cabin soon after and they began drinkingtogether. At around 9 or 10 am, CURDS went to drink at the CantonBeach Sports Club with MURRAY. While they were there, theDeceased made a telephone call to his friend CURDS, andarranged to meet CURDS and MURRAY at the Club. The Club wasa short distance from the caravan park.
5. The Deceased arrived at the Club and started drinking alcohol andplaying the poker machines with CURDS and MURRAY. Aftersome drinks, MURRAY and CURDS walked back to CURDS' cabinin the caravan park. The Deceased dropped his car home, andlater arrived at CURDS' cabin with 3 longneck bottles of beer.
6. Between 1.30 and 2pm, the Offender, who was a friend of CURDSand had met MURRAY before, came to CURDS' cabin. He sawthat the group was drinking and said that he would go and get somedrinks and come back later. The Offender left, returning after around half an hour with a bottle of vodka and a 4-pack of vodka pre-mixed drinks.
7. Around 3pm, the Deceased ran out of beer. The group walked backto the Club so that the Deceased could buy more alcohol, and sothe Offender could buy something to eat. They had a drink each atthe Club then bought some take-away alcohol and returned toCURDS' cabin. They were all very intoxicated, and they continueddrinking.
8. At some stage the Deceased and MURRAY went into CURDS'cabin, and the Offender and CURDS remained outside. TheOffender handed CURDS one of the pre-mixed vodka drinks andsaid ""skull it, skull it. Don't be a weak cunt'.
9. CURDS decided to skull the drink and once he had finished, theOffender laughed and said, 'I just drugged you'. CURDS took whatthe offender said as a joke.
10.At some stage the Deceased went to use the toilet in the cabin andnoticed CURDS passed out on his bed. The Deceased then askedthe Offender if he had slipped anything in CURDS' drink and theOffender replied ""I don't have any drugs"". Shortly after this, theOffender made a comment toward MURRAY involving calling her a""slut"". The Deceased said ""You don't have to go talking to womenlike that"" and told the Offender ""Get out"". The Offender apologisedand said ""I'm sorry, I was out of line "". The Deceased said ""Justmake sure it doesn't happen again"". The Deceased then startedgetting argumentative and asking the Offender again to get out.
11.After some arguing, the Deceased said to the Offender ""we don'thang out with people like you"" and told the Offender to get his stuffand get out of CURDS' cabin. The Offender apologised again andsaid ""I was out of line"". The Deceased said ""I don't care I just wantyou to leave because you're starting to piss me off and if you don'tleave I will make you leave"". The Deceased offered to ""take itoutside"" and the Offender and (sic) said ""I don't want to fight, I don'tknow how to fight"".
12. The Deceased told the Offender ""if you come back here again youwill know about it. Don't come back here again"". The Offenderpicked up his bag and bottle of vodka and went to leave. TheDeceased followed the Offender outside. The Offender walkedaway. The Offender had not behave (sic) aggressively while in thecompany of the Deceased, CURDS and MURRAY.
13. MURRAY and the Deceased went back inside the cabin. TheDeceased became more agitated and decided he wanted to golooking for the Offender to confront him physically. After around 20minutes, he got up and walked out and said ""we'll go for a walk andsee where he is"".
14. The Deceased walked through the caravan park looking for theOffender, and approached a male in the park and asked him wherethe Offender lived.
15.ln the meantime, the Offender had returned to his mother'scaravan. The Offender's mother saw that he was angry and veryagitated and could tell that he had been drinking alcohol, as healmost fell through the door into the caravan.
16. The Offender said ""Mum quick give me a sharp knife"". She replied""we don't have any sharp knives. What do you want a sharp knifefor? Don't be stupid go to bed"". The Offender said ""No, they'recoming for me in a couple of seconds"".
17. The Offender opened the top cutlery draw and took out two smallsteak knives. The Offender put the knives inside the waistband ofhis pants and walked out. The Offender's mother states that hewas very angry and very agitated.
18. Just after the Offender left his mother's caravan, his mother saw theDeceased walking past her van. The Deceased approached herand asked ""Where's Chooky?"" Chooky is the nickname of theOffender's brother Kevin. The Offender's mother said ""he's asleepand sick"". The Deceased then walked away, and he and MURRAYthen walked out of the front gate of the Park.
19.After leaving his mother's caravan, the Offender went to the nearbycaravan of John LEGGE. LEGGE also noticed that the Offenderwas angry and agitated. The Offender said ""I'm pissed off"".LEGGE asked ""Oh what's wrong?"" The Offender said ""have you gota big knife?"" LEGGE said ""I haven't got a big knife"". The Offenderthen pulled his shirt up and LEGGE saw the black coloured plastichandles of knives in the band of his shorts, either side of his waist.The Offender pulled out one of the knives, which LEGGE then sawwas a serrated kitchen type knife.
20. The Offender said ""I'm going to go and bash someone"". LEGGEtried to take the knife off the Offender and ended up with a cut to hisindex finger. The Offender walked out with the knife still in hishand, and said ""I'm going to go and fix this bloke up"".
21. By this time, it was shortly after 5:30pm, and there were numerousmembers of the public of varying ages, from young children toelderly people, in the area - walking, sitting and eating, andspending time with family members in the area around the lakeforeshore, as well as travelling along Beach Parade in vehicles.
22. The Deceased and MURRAY were on the footpath of BeachParade a few steps away from the Park gate, returning to thecaravan park after having decided to go back to CURDS' cabin,when they heard the Offender call out ""Hoi, Hoi"". They turned andsaw the Offender walking towards them. They stopped to let himcatch up with them.
23. The Offender approached the Deceased and MURRAY and said tothe Deceased ""What's your problem?"" The Deceased said ""youdrugged my mate"" and the Offender replied ""No I was joking aboutthat. Daniel's my mate too I just came over to have a few drinkswith him"".
24. The Offender and the deceased began yelling and swearing at eachother. Several witnesses state that they heard the Deceased say tothe offender ""Don't be so gutless"" and 'Come on do it, do it', as hepointed to his stomach area. While this was being said, the offenderstood still with his arms crossed behind his back, holding a knife.The Deceased yelled aggressively at the offender, with his faceclose to the Offender's. At one stage the Deceased was pulled 2 to3 metres away by Jodie MURRAY, but moved back to the Offenderand continued yelling at him. MURRAY then got the Deceased tomove away from the Offender and speak to her.
25. The Deceased then approached the Offender again and pushedhim with both hands to the front of his chest. The Offenderstumbled back and fell over. He then got up and produced a knifefrom behind his back.
26. The Deceased told MURRAY to run, and gave her his phone.MURRAY then walked back towards the entrance to the Park.
27. The Offender, armed with two knives, then commenced a frenziedattack upon the Deceased stabbing him repeatedly in the neck andtorso.
28. The Offender continued stabbing as the Deceased turned his backto the Offender. The Offender was seen to leap from the ground toenable him to land blows in the back of the Deceased's neck.Witnesses at the scene described the Deceased as stumblingaround, and making no effort to defend himself when this washappening.
29. The Deceased then fell to the ground in the roadway outside thedriveway of the Park. The Offender continued to stab theDeceased in the face and neck. The Offender was heard bywitnesses shouting things like ""how does that feel?"" toward theDeceased. The Offender kicked the Deceased a number of timeswhile he was on the ground. A witness, Jeffrey STEVENSON, whowas watching and describing the attack to a 000 operator out of anearby window, states that the Offender was laughing and dancingaround the Deceased and appeared to be enjoying himself.
30.At some stage the Offender's mother had come out to the front ofthe Park after being told that the Offender was involved in a fight.The Deceased was on the ground and the Offender momentarilystopped attacking the Deceased, leaving him lying in the gutterupon the roadway. The Offender approached his mother andspoke with her, touching her on the shoulder.
31. The Offender then continued to attack the Deceased. Witnessesobserved the Offender walk back and forth between his mother andthe Deceased, each time stabbing the Deceased in the chest andtorso, and sometimes kicking him in the head. When the witnessesAllyson and Steven CHAPMAN came driving past the scene, theysaw the Offender stabbing the Deceased, then stop and look up athis mother, have a brief (up to 5 second) conversation with her, andthen resume stabbing the Deceased.
32.At some stage the Offender started to slash the knife across theDeceased's throat in a manner that witnesses described as trying tocut the Deceased's head off. The Offender held the Deceased bythe hair at some stage while slicing at the Deceased's neck, andbanged his head against the roadway.
33. STEVENSON described the Offender stopping to undo a gold chainthat was around the Deceased's neck. After removing the chain theOffender threw it in the direction of the driveway and continuedcutting at the Deceased's throat.
34. STEVENSON and his partner, Carla PRESBURY also stated that atsome stage the Offender stopped and stood up. He looked at theDeceased and then crouched back down and started cutting at theDeceased's ear with the knife. After a short time he said to hismother ""how's this?"" or ""have a fucking look at that"".
35.Around this time, Tracey MCKAY and Michele HOWITT, who were travelling in a vehicle along Beach Parade, arrived at the scene and saw the Deceased lying in the gutter while the Offender was pacing between the Deceased and his mother. They slowed their vehicle and stopped close to the Deceased. At the time they had their windows down, and the Offender walked towards them, staringstraight at the witnesses in their vehicle with a smirk on his face.He said 'I don't care I'm not finished' and then returned to theDeceased and continued sawing and stabbing at his throat.
36. By this stage several 000 calls had been made, and a passingdriver had driven to the nearby Toukley police station to report theattack.
37. Detectives arrived at the scene and saw the Offender crouchedover the Deceased's body still stabbing him in the head and neckarea. The Offender continued this at a rapid pace while Detectivesdrew their service firearms and yelled at him to drop the knife. Theysaw that the Offender was covered with a large amount of bloodover his chest, face, hands, arms and legs.
38. The Offender complied with the direction, dropped the knife thatwas in his hand and walked toward the centre of the road with hisarms up. The Offender laid face down on the road as requested.
The Offender said to police ""You got me, you got me, I got himokay, you got me"" and then said to police ""come on have a go.Come on, just shoot me, shoot me"".
39.A witness, Alan POTTER, heard the Offender yell out to his mother""I had to do what I had to do. Mum, forget about me. I'm dead. Ilove you. Mum, it's my fault, not yours."", while alternating betweenyelling and laughing.
40. The Offender was heard by police to say ""fucking bikies won't getme. Coming to cut my head off. Who's fucking dead now"" andlaughing. He also said ""I tried to cut his head off. I would have butit got hard at the back"".
41. The Offender was then placed into a police vehicle. At this stagehe said ""whose blood is this? Why am I in handcuffs? Whoseblood? Why do I have claret on me, why am I under arrest?"".Police replied ""you're under arrest for murder"". The Offenderresponded ""Who? What do you mean what have I done?""
42.A short time later Ambulance Officers arrived and couldimmediately see that the Deceased had suffered fatal injuries. Ablanket was placed over his body.
43. The Ambulance Officers then tended to the Offender, who had alaceration to the palm of his right hand.
44. Police located two broken steak knives upon the roadway in closeproximity to where the Offender was arrested. Also located nearbywas a small paring knife. The Deceased's gold neck chain waslocated in the driveway.
45. The Offender was transported to The Entrance Police Station. TheCustody Officer noted that he appeared to be under the influence ofalcohol or drugs and that he was very talkative and speakingquickly. After being read his rights under the Law EnforcementPowers and Responsibilities Act, he said ""Life is good"", ""Apparentlysome guy got stabbed tonight and is going to die"", ""I need a shower,I've got some other guy's blood on me"", ""life's good when you havea mental illness"", ""Apparently a guy got stabbed and he said he wasa bikie. He was threatening my family and he got fucked up.Apparently I tried to cut his fuckin' head off"", ""Where's the CIBhere? I want to know what's going on. Apparently I killed a guy"" and""Apparently I stabbed someone and it was daylight"".
46. He was offered the opportunity to participate in an electronicinterview. He initially agreed and commenced the interview,however a short time into it he requested to speak to a lawyerbefore being interviewed further. The interview was thenterminated. The Offender participated in a number of forensicprocedures before he was charged with the murder of theDeceased.
47.An autopsy was conducted on the Deceased's body. It wasconcluded that the direct cause of death was multiple stab injuriesto the neck and chest and that many of the stab injuries would beregarded as being individually fatal. Approximately 107 injuries,including 105 stab wounds and a severe gaping wound to theDeceased's neck were identified. There was minimal evidence ofdefensive injuries.
48.lt was noted that the damage to the major blood vessels of the neckand shoulder would have caused a very rapid death due to bloodloss and lack of blood supply to the brain. The Deceased wouldhave been expected to become unconscious at some time beforedeath.""
4I make findings of facts in accordance with the agreed facts for the purpose of sentencing the offender. 
5The offender's prolonged attack upon the deceased was extraordinarily savage. Included in the coroner's findings were seven stab injuries that had penetrated the chest cavity and an approximately 23cm long, 5cm wide transverse incised injury on the front aspect of the upper neck (injury 18). This injury was 8cm deep in the middle of the neck and extended up to the level of the cervical spine (C1 level). A series of at least 18 stab injuries were situated on the right side of the neck immediately below the ear and immediately right to injury 18. These stab wounds had penetrated into the deep neck muscles on the lateral aspect of the right side of the neck, through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to varying depths in complex manner. Internal structures damaged included jugular veins and carotid arteries. There were a series of 11 incised stab injuries, including a sharp nick, situated on the back aspect of the neck and mid upper back of the shoulder/chest. A series of nine incised stab injuries were situated on the outer aspect of the left side of the chest, approximately between the 5th and 9th ribs. It is an agreed fact that the coroner identified approximately 107 injuries, including 105 stab wounds and a severe gaping wound to the neck. 
6The agreed facts disclose that although the deceased had been repeatedly stabbed in the neck and torso and had turned his back, the offender continued the stabbing and did not desist when the deceased had fallen to the ground. Notwithstanding the presence of his mother and the brief stops to talk to her, the offender resumed the attack upon the deceased who was lying in the gutter. The immense brutality of the killing is demonstrated by the slashing of the deceased's throat in a manner that witnesses described as trying to cut the deceased's head off, the banging of the deceased's head against the roadway, the removal of the deceased's gold neck chain and the cutting at the deceased's ear. 
7I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at time the offender attacked the deceased with the knives that he had the intention to kill him. The Crown did not invite me to find that prior to that time he had an intention to kill. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when he told Mr Legge that he was ""going to go and fix this bloke up"" and was armed with the knives, that he intended to inflict serious injuries to the deceased. 
8The agreed facts reveal that after the offender caught up with the deceased, they began yelling and swearing at each other. The deceased was heard to say ""Don't be so gutless"" and ""Come on do it, do it"" as he pointed to his stomach area. The deceased yelled aggressively at the offender, with his face close to his. The deceased was pulled back twice by Jodie Murray, but approached the offender again. On the second occasion, the deceased pushed the offender with both hands to the front of his chest. The offender stumbled back and fell over. The deceased was 193cm tall. 
9Mr Fitzgerald submitted that the deceased's conduct allowed for an assessment of provocation. Provocation by the deceased is a mitigating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence: s 21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Following the decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock, there has been some debate about the range of factors to be considered in determining the objective seriousness of the offence: see Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49; R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288. The High Court held at [27] that the objective seriousness of an offence is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending and without reference to matters personal to an offender. In my view, where provocation is established such that it is a mitigating factor under s 21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, it is a fundamental quality of the offending which may reduce its objective seriousness. In any event, provocation is a factor relevant to the appropriate sentence to be imposed: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the deceased's aggression towards the offender provided some provocation, but the attack that followed was far out of any reasonable proportion to the deceased's behaviour. Furthermore, the offender had caught up with the deceased with the intent to seriously injure him. I give very modest weight to the deceased's provocation in mitigation of the offence. 
10It is a factor in mitigation that the murder was not planned: s 21A(3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
11Although these are factors of mitigation, the seriousness of the offending is of a high order. The attack upon the deceased was extremely violent and hideous wounds were inflicted. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference to be drawn from the combination of the gaping wound to the neck, the observations of witnesses and what was said by the offender (see [3.40] above), is that the offender tried unsuccessfully to cut the deceased's head off during the attack. Whilst the offender's intoxication and use of methamphetamine provides support for the finding that the murder was not planned, his intoxication and methamphetamine use for the reasons recounted at [19] - [27] below neither mitigate nor aggravate the offence. 
12The offender does not have a prior criminal record in New South Wales. His criminal history in Queensland includes convictions for wilful destruction of property, possession of a knife in a public place (2004), common assault (2005), assault occasioning bodily harm and wilful damage (2006), grievous bodily harm with intent and wilful damage (2008). For the offences of assault occasioning bodily harm and wilful damage, he was sentenced on 24 July 2006 in the District Court at Bundaberg to concurrent terms of 18 months and 12 months imprisonment that were suspended for two years after six months of imprisonment was served. On 12 February 2008 for the offence of grievous bodily harm with intent, the offender was sentenced to imprisonment for four years and for the offence of wilful damage to imprisonment for one year. The sentences were to be served concurrently, but to commence at the end of the sentence imposed for the breach of the sentences that had been suspended. The earliest date he was eligible for release to parole was 19 August 2009. That criminal history deprives the offender of the consideration of leniency to which he may have been entitled if the current offence was an isolated act of criminality. 
13The Crown submitted that the offender's record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences and the commission of the murder whilst the offender was on conditional liberty are aggravating factors under s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Mr Fitzgerald said that the offender did not cavel with the factors of aggravation identified by the Crown. 
14Section 21A(2)(d) provides that an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence is:
""the offender has a record of previous convictions (particularly if the offender is being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence and has a record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences).""
15A serious personal violence offence ""means a personal violence offence (within the meaning of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007) that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of 5 years or more"": s 21A(6) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
16The offence of murder falls within the meaning of a ""personal violence offence"" in s 4 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act, but the offences committed in Queensland, do not fall within the definition as they are not offences ""under, or mentioned in"" the sections nominated in s 4(a). Nevertheless, s 21A(2)(d) is not confined to a record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences. The offences of assault occasioning bodily harm and grievous bodily harm with intent are punishable under the Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) by terms of imprisonment of five years or more and are serious violence offences. I find the offender's prior record of serious violence offences to be a factor of aggravation when determining the appropriate sentence. The offender's prior record does not increase the objective seriousness of the murder, nor is it an objective circumstance for the purpose of the application of the proportionality principle and does not determine the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) NSWLR 566. In view of the offender's prior violent offending I give more weight to personal deterrence and protection of society than otherwise would have been the case: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465.
17At the time of the murder, the offender was on parole for the offence of grievous bodily harm with intent. He gave evidence that he had been released to parole on 21 June 2010, but that is inconsistent with the agreed fact that he had been living with his mother since May 2010 (see [3.2] above). In any event, the offender abused his conditional liberty by stabbing the deceased to death. The commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty has long been regarded as a factor of aggravation requiring the passing of a deterrent sentence: R v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28; R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435; (1999) 48 NSWLR 327. 
18The offender was born on 10 March 1975 and is 37 years of age. He was 35 years old at the time of the murder. His personal history is taken from the report dated 2 April 2011 of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist (ex 1). The offender was born in Camperdown and was the only child of his parents. As his three half siblings were considerably older, the offender was effectively brought up as an only child. He moved to Queensland at the age of thirteen where he lived until his release from prison. The offender left school before the age of 15, has TAFE certificates in horticulture, landscaping and hospitality and has worked in various occupations. The offender has a son from a relationship that ended in 2003 who he was permitted to see once a month. 
19The offender told Dr Nielssen that alcohol had been a big problem in his life, that he was affected by alcohol at the time of the assault of his father in 2006 and the further offence in 2007 was alcohol related. The offender reported use of cannabis from the age of about fourteen and periods of daily use of the drug in his late teenage years. His use of the drug had slowed after the birth of his son when he was aged 21 and did not report any heavy or regular use from that time. The offender said that he had not used cannabis after his release from prison. He denied taking other drugs and said that the only time he had taken methamphetamine was on the day of the murder. 
20Dr Nielssen noted that the offender's mother described him as ""very unpredictable and violent when he drank alcohol."" Dr Nielssen diagnosed alcohol abuse disorder, dysthymic disorder (chronic low grade depressive illness) and possible bipolar mood disorder. Dr Nielssen opined that (ex 1 p7):
""It seems that [the] main reason for the offence was Mr Willmott's state of intoxication and his association with other highly intoxicated people, which added to the risk of an alcohol fuelled altercation. Mr Willmott reported a heightened perception of threat, which might have been due to the physical presence of the deceased. It seems he has a pattern of becoming aggressive whilst intoxicated, which would have been increased by the effect of a moderate dose of methamphetamine taken several hours before the offence."" 
21The psychiatrist stated that there was no information to suggest that the offender was in a state of psychosis before he started drinking or in the period after his arrest, and the state of mind reported by the offender was probably due to intoxication, including intoxication with amphetamine. The offender's report of no memory of the offence itself suggested an alcohol related period of amnesia or black out. The offender was not thought to be mentally ill around the time of the offence, or to have a defect of reason arising from mental illness that might leave open the defence of mental illness. As to the possible mood disorder, Dr Nielssen stated that there was little information available to suggest the presence of an abnormality of mind prior to commencing drinking or taking amphetamine, and the applicant's abnormal state of mind at the time of the offence appeared to be largely due to the effects of intoxication. The diagnosis of dysthymic disorder was made on the basis of the offender's account of longstanding symptoms of depression that were not severe enough to prevent him from performing most social roles, such as working and forming long term relationships. 
22Professor Starmer, a pharmacologist, recounts at par 5 of a report dated 7 September 2011, the amount of alcohol that the offender said that he had consumed on the day of the murder. Professor Starmer was also told that he had consumed two points of ""ice"", that he had not used ""ice"" before and ""adrenaline was rushing through [his] body, sober from the alcohol, but really speedy."" If the offender's recall of his alcohol consumption was accurate, Professor Starmer estimated that at the time of the murder, the offender's blood alcohol concentration would have been about 0.434g/100ml, which was described as being extraordinarily high. Professor Starmer reported that although the offender has been a heavy drinker, and was likely to have been very tolerant to alcohol, he would have displayed most, if not all, of the signs and symptoms of intoxication with a blood alcohol concentration well within the lethal range. 
23When considering the effects of ""ice"" in combination with alcohol, Professor Starmer opined ""that both methylamphetamine and alcohol are known to be associated with aggression and violent behaviour and it is likely that when taken in combination the effects would be at least additive"": ex 2 p5-6. 
24During his evidence, the offender said that he had no independent memory of the murder, but had never denied taking the deceased's life. He had been frank with Dr Nielssen and had given him his best recollection. He had given his solicitor his best recollection of his alcohol consumption and use of methamphetamine. The offender told me that he felt that he needed counselling, had spoken to a psychiatrist and was taking Avanza, an antidepressant and Epilim, a mood stabiliser, which he found gave him more control over his life and was willing to continue with this medication. He had realised the large part played by alcohol in the offence and said that he would never drink again. He continued to have the support of his 75 year old mother and of his extended family. In cross-examination by the Crown, the offender said that the first time he had been asked to remember how much alcohol he had consumed was probably a couple of weeks after the murder. When asked whether he had used amphetamines prior to the day of the murder, the offender replied that when he was a teenager he had ""a little bit of it."" He did not recall telling Dr Elliott, a prison psychiatrist, that he had injected amphetamines on three occasions at around 16 or 17. Dr Nielssen had noted that Dr Elliott elicited a history of the offender injecting amphetamines on three occasions at around the age of 16 or 17: ex 1 p4. 
25The Crown submitted that caution should be used in accepting the amount of alcohol that Professor Starmer was informed the offender consumed on the day and the agreed facts pointed to one matter of inaccuracy. The Crown contended that the objective seriousness of the offence was not diminished by the mental state of the offender or by any significant intoxication on his behalf. The Crown did not invite me to find that the offender's intoxication aggravated the crime.
26Mr Fitzgerald submitted that the offender's intoxication and use of ""ice"" provided an explanation for the murder and the manner in which it was committed. What was described by counsel as the ""staccato attack"" upon the deceased, was said to be in keeping with the offender's intoxication and distraction of mind. Mr Fitzgerald did not contend that the offender's intoxication and use of ""ice"" mitigated the seriousness of the offence or that the offender fell within the ""out of character"" exception: see Stanford v R [2007] NSWCCA 73.
27I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the account of the offender's consumption of alcohol that founded Professor Starmer's assessment of the offender's blood alcohol concentration is entirely accurate. As the Crown pointed out, it is an agreed fact that the offender gave one of the pre-mixed vodka drinks to Daniel Curds, who drank it, whereas Professor Starmer was informed that the offender had consumed the four pack of Black Ice Vodka. It is not surprising that there is some inaccuracy in the offender's account as he was not asked to recall what he had drunk until a couple of weeks after the murder. I accept that he was intoxicated to a significant extent at the time of the offending but the extent of his intoxication did not prevent him from sustaining a prolonged attack upon the deceased. As Dr Nielssen observed, the offender had a pattern of becoming aggressive whilst intoxicated which would have been increased by the effect of the moderate dose of methamphetamine taken several hours before the offence. The offender's intoxication does not mitigate the seriousness of the murder but assists in providing an explanation for the crime and the horrific manner in which the deceased was killed. The offender's prior history of heavy drinking and of violent offending whilst affected by alcohol demonstrates that his intoxication was not out of character for him. He had previously used amphetamines as a young person. I conclude that his intoxication and consumption of methamphetamine neither mitigates nor aggravates the offence. 
28Mr Fitzgerald did not submit that the psychiatric disorders diagnosed by Dr Nielssen should impact upon the offender's culpability for the offence or upon the part that specific or general deterrence might play in the sentencing exercise: see for example R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; R v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342; (2006) 167 A Crim R 436. The evidence does not establish that the offender lacked the capacity to reason, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his faculties and emotions or that the state of his mental health contributed to the commission of the offence in a material way: DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1. 
29The Crown invited me to find that the offender's future dangerousness was of a high order in light of the circumstances of the murder, his prior criminal history and long-term alcohol use. Mr Fitzgerald argued that the Court would not be greatly concerned as to the offender's future dangerousness upon release because of his realisation of the part that intoxication had played in the murder, his taking of the prescribed medication and future professional assistance.
30A finding of future dangerousness does not need to be established beyond reasonable doubt: R v SLD [2003] NSWCCA 310; (2003) 58 NSWLR 589. It is sufficient if the Crown establishes on the balance of probabilities that there is a risk of re-offending: R v Harrison (1997) 93 A Crim R 314. Unless the offender can overcome his alcohol abuse, the risk of future dangerousness that he presents to the community is high. The risk will moderate naturally with advanced age. The offender's prior alcohol related offending and return to the heavy consumption of alcohol upon release to parole encourages a pessimistic view being taken of his prospects of rehabilitation and the risk of violent re-offending upon release. I consider that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are poor. I have no doubt that much will depend upon the insight that the offender develops into his alcohol abuse prior to release. That does not mean that I find that he has no prospects of rehabilitation. To do so would ignore his evidence of remorse, his realisation of the part played by intoxication in the murder, the steps that have been taken with medication, his family support and the possible benefits of future counselling. 
31There is, in my opinion, a need for an element of specific deterrence in the sentence. I also give weight to the protection of the community. I have kept in mind the principle of proportionality and the sentence is not to be increased beyond that which is proportionate to the crime: Veen (No 2). 
32Remorse as a mitigating factor is qualified by s 21A(3)(i) (i)-(ii) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which requires the offender to provide evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his actions. By his plea of guilty, the offender has accepted responsibility for the murder. Furthermore, during his evidence, he declared his sorrow for the loss and pain he has caused to the deceased's family and that he would give his life to bring the deceased back if he could. I conclude on the probabilities that he is genuinely remorseful and take into account his remorse as a factor of mitigation. 
33The maximum sentence for the crime of murder is imprisonment for life. A person sentenced to imprisonment for life is to serve that sentence for the term of his natural life: s 19A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 19A(3) provides that nothing in s 19A affects the operation of s 21(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life). 
34Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides: ""A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.""
35The primary focus of s 61(1) is an assessment of how extreme the offender's culpability is: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; (2004) 59 NSWLR 557. The Crown submitted that, although the offence was of ""a high state of objective seriousness...it may well fall below that level that would cause your Honour to consider life imprisonment."" Mr Fitzgerald said that whilst he was not suggesting that ""this is anything bar a matter of high objective seriousness...it is not of the highest and nor is it near the highest category of offences of that style."" 
36Although the offender's level of culpability is of a high order, I am not satisfied that it is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through a life sentence. 
37The offender pleaded guilty to the murder during the committal hearing in the Local Court in December 2011. Although the Crown accepted that this was an early plea, it did not concede that the plea was entered at the earliest opportunity. Mr Fitzgerald submitted that the committal hearing was undertaken to examine Jodie Murray, a Crown witness, who had given two statements that had left the Crown case ""as to the complete order of events on that day in some state of flux or contradiction."" The contradictory statements together with the offender's lack of independent memory, required Ms Murray's cross-examination to see where the case lay so that the offender might receive advice and give proper instructions. At the conclusion of Ms Murray's evidence, the offender had pleaded guilty and had done so at the very first instance that the case against the offender was made known to him. Mr Fitzgerald contended that the offender's plea was entered at the first available opportunity. In reply, the Crown did not accept that Ms Murray had made inconsistent statements and pointed out that she was not a sole witness to the crime. There were numerous witnesses who had observed the stabbings and Ms Murray had left the scene a short time before. The Crown submitted that if a trial had proceeded, it would not have been overly complex. 
38There were persons other than Ms Murray, who had witnessed the murder but Ms Murray was nevertheless an important witness. The discount for the utilitarian value of the plea is determined largely by the timing of the plea: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1, though there will be exceptional circumstances where it is appropriate to give a full utilitarian discount notwithstanding the fact that the plea had not been entered at the earliest opportunity: R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229; (2011) 59 MVR 356 per Bathurst CJ at [2]. I am satisfied in the present circumstances, that the offender is entitled to a utilitarian discount of 20 per cent for his plea of guilty. 
39Victim impact statements of Tammy Curphey, the deceased's sister and Jennifer Curphey, the deceased's mother were read to the Court. The contents of the statements cannot be used by me to increase the offender's sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased's family and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them.
40Taking into account all factors that are relevant to sentence, the appropriate undiscounted starting point of the overall sentence I conclude, is 35 years. The overall sentence is reduced by 20 per cent to 28 years. 
41The offender's parole was revoked with effect from the day of the murder as a result of its commission. At my invitation, a joint written submission (now marked MFI A) was made by the Crown and Mr Fitzgerald as to questions of accumulation and special circumstances. The parties have pointed out that if the sentence commences today, the period spent by the offender in continuous custody would be extended by approximately 21 months and one week. One of the other matters raised was that he was at liberty for a short period before returning to custody to serve the balance of parole of the 12 February 2008 sentence, but which took into account two prior periods in custody commencing on 25 April 2007. At the time of sentencing, the offender will have been in custody for the most part of the previous 5 years. 
42Another matter raised was that the offender's imprisonment was likely to be more onerous because he suffers from psychiatric disorders and he will be held in maximum security. The evidence of his conditions of imprisonment was confined to that of the offender who testified that since his arrest, he had been in maximum security. He had initially been in an area marked ""non-association"", but was now in maximum security with limited association. It had been indicated to him that he would serve his sentence in limited association, maximum security. The offender was presently working as a leading hand in hygiene, which he would like to continue. 
43I am not persuaded that the offender's custodial conditions will be more onerous than those of the general prison population so that they might be taken into account in mitigation of the sentence or in the finding of special circumstances. Furthermore, it was the offender's testimony that the medication prescribed by the psychiatrists was having a beneficial effect upon him. There is no evidence that demonstrates that imprisonment will be more burdensome for the offender because of his psychiatric disorders. 
44Although it is usual principle that allowance is made for pre-sentence custody where it is exclusively referable to the crime for which the offender is being sentenced, I have taken into account as a circumstance of aggravation that the murder was committed whilst the offender was on parole. Moreover, he has been in custody for almost 5 years and I take into account the total period of imprisonment: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59. Accordingly, the sentence will commence on 13 October 2010 and not upon the expiration of his current parole. 
45I do not consider that special circumstances exist which justifies the balance of the term of the sentence exceeding one-third of the non-parole period. The balance of term of 7 years is a sufficient period under supervision to enable the offender to adjust to community life and to establish an effective treatment regime. 
46Kevin Robert Willmott for the murder of Shane Curphey, I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 21 years which is to commence on 13 October 2010 and is to expire on 12 October 2031. I set a balance of term of 7 years which is to commence on 13 October 2031 and will expire on 12 October 2038. 
47The earliest date of eligibility for your release to parole is 12 October 2031.

2417424,R v PINCOVAI [2012] NSWSC 1015,"Judgment

1The offender, Sabina Pincovai, pleaded guilty on the morning of her trial for accessory after the fact to murder, to the alternative conceal serious offence in full discharge of the indictment presented by the Crown. The availability of that charge as an alternative to the more serious offence of accessorial liability arose for the first time today. The offence carries a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment and is amenable to summary disposition. The agreed facts giving rise to the offence may be summarised as follows: the offender and Martin Booth were in a de facto relationship for approximately seven years, during which time the offender was violently assaulted by Mr Booth on a regular basis.

2The offender received amphetamines to which she was addicted from Mr Booth, who purchased the drug from one Ms Nolan. The offender acted as the gobetween. A dispute over payment between Mr Booth and Ms Nolan in mid March 2011 escalated to the point where Mr Booth seriously assaulted Ms Nolan's partner in their home. Ms Nolan's brothers, James and Patrick, resolved to visit Mr Booth, who had been informed that the men intended to assault him. When the Nolan brothers attended at the premises where Mr Booth and the offender lived at about 9pm on 19 March 2011, Mr Booth answered the door carrying a loaded shotgun.

3As James Nolan moved towards Mr Booth he discharged the gun, killing James Nolan instantly. The offender was in the lounge room. Immediately on seeing the deceased she screamed ""What have you done?"" and became hysterical. She left the house with Mr Booth and drove to a friend's home and then to a hotel in Gateshead. On 21 March Ms Booth and the offender went to Mr Booth's mother's home, then to a solicitor, where they were arrested. On 23 March the offender indicated she wished to speak to the police but then withdrew that request. She remained in custody for twelve weeks and one day before a grant of bail on strict reporting conditions.

4The objective criminality consists of the offender's failure to report the offence to police between the shooting and her arrest, a period of about two days. That criminality is to some extent explained by her fear of Mr Booth and the exploitative nature of their relationship. The offender's addiction to amphetamines no doubt has compromised her capacity to make rational decisions, particularly when under stress. The offender's criminal history does her no credit. She has never received a custodial sentence despite a number of fraud related offences between 2003 and 2004. She has received the benefit of a number of bonds for those offences.

5The offender is presently twentyeight years of age. She lives with her father and her son, who is now aged twelve, at Nelson Bay. I am informed that she had the child at the tender age of sixteen, having left school two years previously. Her parents, either her mother or her father, have cared for the child for some considerable time. The offender is one of five children. Her father is unemployed but is, however, the fulltime carer of her son, with whom it appears she has forged a stronger relationship more recently. The offender has sought work in Sydney and undertakes that work whenever required.

6During the course of her bail she was reporting three days a week to police at Nelson Bay. That reporting condition may well have curtailed her employment opportunities to some extent. She informed me in the course of giving evidence that she was scared to report the offence to police and scared to speak to them following her arrest. Her time in custody at Mulawa has been salutary. She understands perhaps for the first time the rigours of imprisonment and wishes to avoid them at all cost. Having regard to the short lived duration of her offending, its relatively low objective criminality, her personal circumstances and her efforts more recently to provide for her son and remain drug free, I am persuaded that the time the offender has spent in custody for this offence represents adequate punishment.

7I am not altogether persuaded that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are promising. The ease with which she may slip into her former life and resume drug taking is unfortunately a common scenario before the courts, but equally the remedy lies solely with her. She has undertaken drug counselling in the past, perhaps at a time when her responsibilities as a mother were not so real to her. It would appear that she has now chosen to be involved more fully in her son's life.

8Taking all of these matters into account, I propose to sentence the offender as follows. Sabina Pincovai, you are convicted of the offence of conceal serious offence. I order that you be placed under a bond to be of good behaviour for twelve months, pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Proceedings) Act to date from today, 24 July 2012, and to expire on 23 July 2013.

9Ms Pincovai, that means that you must stay out of trouble for twelve months and hopefully for any time thereafter. I have refrained from imposing any particular conditions on you because of my impression that if you are to turn your life around it rests in your hands and in nobody else's. Hopefully if you do need counselling to overcome your drug addiction, you are able to seek that counselling yourself with the assistance of your father and any other health professional that you might engage. If you do commit an offence within that twelve months it is highly likely no court will extend any further leniency to you and you will serve a custodial sentence.

Stewart;

v.

Thorp and others

1918: May 13, 14, 15; 1918: June 10.

Present:—Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington,
and Brodeur JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
ALBERTA.

Criminal law—Contract—Restraint of trade—Unduly lessening
competition—Sec. 498 Cr. C.

[Page 671]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division[1],
reversing the judgment of Walsh J. at the trial[2], and
dismissing the appellant's (plaintiff's) action with costs.

The defendant, respondent, the Canadian Anthracite Coal
Company, Limited, was the owner of large coal areas in the Canmore District in
this province, of which the defendant the Canmore Coal Company, Limited, was
the lessee. The plaintiff, appellant, was a shareholder in both of these
companies. The individual defendants, respondents, were directors, some of
them, of one of these companies, and some of them, of the other, and some of them
of both. By agreement dated the 15th of September, 1916, the former company
agreed to buy from the defendant, respondent, the Georgetown Collieries,
Limited, a rival concern operating in the same district, all of the assets of
that company, for the sum of $100,000 plus the cost price of all its supplies
and stock in trade. This agreement has been executed by the Anthracite Coal
Company, but the execution of it by the Georgetown company was prevented by an
injunction in this action restraining it from doing so, and it is for that
reason still unexecuted by it. $2,500 has been paid for the supplies, but the
payment of anything further

[Page 672]

under the contract was stopped by the
same injunction. The plaintiff, appellant, sought a declaration that this agreement
was ""unlawful, illegal and ultra vires"" an injunction
restraining each of the defendant, respondent, companies from entering into
""any other agreement, arrangement, conspiracy or combine with the
defendant the Georgetown Collieries, Limited, forbidden by section 498  of the
Criminal Code ,"" from paying over any moneys under the impeached agreement
or from doing any further act or thing in the carrying out of the same, and an
accounting by the individual defendants for any moneys of either the Anthracite
company or the Canmore company, paid to the Georgetown company under the same
and judgment against them for all moneys so paid.

The action was tried by Mr. Justice Walsh, who dismissed the
action at the close of the plaintiff's case as against the defendants,
respondents, the Georgetown Collieries, Limited. He, however, after hearing the
evidence of the defence, directed judgment to be entered and a formal judgment
was entered accordingly, declaring that the arrangements between the other two
companies for the purchase by them of the coal deposits of the Georgetown
Collieries, Limited, are illegal, tending to unduly prevent or lessen
competition in the production, sale and supply of an article which may be the
subject of trade or commerce as provided in section 498  of the Criminal Code ,
but not otherwise in contravention of the said section, and also declaring that
the directors of the Canmore Coal Company, Limited, are liable to the said
company for any moneys paid by that company in respect of the agreement in
question. A reference was ordered to ascertain the amounts and the judgment
ordered the defendants, Thorp, Neale, Thorne, Weyerhaeuser, and

[Page 673]

Ingram, to repay the amount so found,
to the said company; otherwise the action was dismissed and no injunction was
granted.

From this judgment the plaintiff appealed and the defendants,
Thorp, Ingram, and Neale, and the two first-mentioned companies cross-appealed.
The Appellate Division held that the provisions of section 498  of the Criminal
Code  are clearly intended to apply to agreements among persons who remain in a
particular business as to the method and plan by which they will carry it on
and as to regulations and rules among themselves so as to lessen competition in
the sale, etc., of any article of commerce, and not to an arrangement to buy
out and out the property of a competitor, consequently the Appellate Division
dismissed the appeal of the present appellant, allowed the cross-appeal of the
present respondent and dismissed the action with costs.

On appeal by the plaintiff to the Supreme Court of Canada, the
court, after hearing counsel for all parties, reserved judgment, and, at a
subsequent date dismissed the appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

Chrysler K.C. and Bennett K.C. for the appellant.

A. H. Clarke K.C. and M. Macleod for the
respondent, the Canmore Coal Company and other respondents.

Collieries Company.

2417758,Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J.

2JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Reece Leonard Beldon, seeks leave to appeal against sentence imposed on 4 March 2011 in the Wollongong Supreme Court upon a charge of murder.

3Following a plea of guilty, the Applicant was sentenced by Barr AJ to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 16 years to commence on 28 November 2008 and to expire on 27 November 2024 with a balance of term of eight years expiring on 27 November 2032. The maximum penalty for murder is imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period of 20 years applies.

Grounds of Appeal

4The Applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:

(a) Ground 1 - his Honour erred in his approach to the Applicant's mental illness and the protection of the public.

(b) Ground 2 - his Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period.

(c) Ground 3 - a different less severe sentence is warranted and ought to have been imposed.

Facts of Offence

5An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered on sentence. Barr AJ described the offence in the following way in his remarks on sentence (R v Beldon [2011] NSWSC 112 at [2]-[5]):

""2 The offender lived in a unit on the second storey of a three storey building at Mangerton. Darren Vickery was staying with him. The deceased, Stephen Solomon, was staying in a unit directly above the offender's unit. On the morning of 27 November 2008 the offender and Vickery went to the unit where the deceased was staying and spoke to him. The three left together and the offender arranged for the deceased to see a doctor at Fairy Meadow. The deceased saw the doctor and obtained a prescription for Oxycontin and Valium. He went to a pharmacy and he or the offender telephoned Vickery, who went to the pharmacy and paid for the drugs. All three returned to the offender's unit where they injected Oxycontin and took Valium. That was at some time after 5:00pm. They repeated the procedure later in the evening. 

3 During the night the deceased repeatedly tried to telephone his de facto wife, who resided in Queensland. The last recorded call was made at 1:55am on 28 November. At about that time the occupant of another unit saw him outside the building using a telephone. The deceased returned to the offender's unit and there was an argument between him and the offender. He accused the offender of stealing the remainder of the drugs and demanded that the offender give him some of his own prescription Oxycontin. The offender took a kitchen knife approximately 30cm long and slashed the deceased's right cheek, leaving a deep incision. He stabbed the deceased in the left upper back. The deceased took a few steps and fell to the floor. 

4 Vickery telephoned the emergency number at 2:55am and asked for an ambulance. Ambulance officers attended. The deceased was lying on his back where he had fallen. He was dead. Police arrived at about 3:10am. The offender and Vickery were present. Police officers spoke to the offender. He had dried blood on his hands, feet, and clothes. 

5 A pathologist examined the deceased's body and concluded that the cause of death was a stab wound to the back of the torso. The wound track was from rear to front and slightly left to right. There was an associated underlying injury to the aorta and both the left chest and abdominal cavities were involved. The wound track was 16 to 17cm long."" 

6The sentencing Judge accepted that the Applicant intended to inflict really serious bodily injury upon the deceased and that there was not intent to kill (ROS [15]).

7The Applicant was arrested on 28 November 2008 and has been in continuous custody since then.

Proceedings Against the Applicant

8The Applicant was charged with the murder of the deceased. Mr Vickery was charged as an accessory after the fact to murder. Both were committed to this Court for trial. On 4 December 2009, the Applicant pleaded not guilty and a joint trial was fixed to begin on 6 April 2010. On that day, an order was made for separate trials. Mr Vickery pleaded guilty and the Applicant's trial was vacated.

9A new trial was fixed to begin on 11 October 2010. The Crown was ready to proceed with the Applicant's trial on 11 October 2010, but the defence was not, and the trial was again vacated. 

10A new trial date was fixed, beginning on 21 February 2011 with a three-week estimate. At the commencement of his trial on 22 February 2011, the Applicant pleaded guilty.

11The Applicant's very late plea of guilty attracted a discount ""at the bottom of the range normally allowed"" (ROS [7]), being a 10% discount.

The Applicant's Subjective Circumstances

12The Applicant was 34 years' old at the time of the offence and 36 years' old at the time of sentence. 

13The Applicant had a significant criminal history, involving offences of violence and breaches of conditional liberty. His criminal history commenced in 1989. Confining attention to offences of violence and breaches of conditional liberty, the Applicant's record included the following:

Malicious wounding

Imprisonment for two years and three months from 1 November 2005 with a non-parole period of 15 months


14It will be observed that the present offence of murder was committed on 28 November 2008, some nine months after the expiration on 1 February 2008 of the Applicant's sentence for the malicious wounding offence.

15The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. A report of Dr Jonathon Adams, forensic psychiatrist, dated 4 February 2011 was tendered, together with a report dated 9 June 2004 of Dr Barbara Sinclair, senior psychiatry registrar with the Corrections Health Service (this report apparently relating to the Applicant's sentence on 16 June 2004 for various offences of violence). 

16Barr AJ recounted the Applicant's deprived upbringing, and his long history of drug use and mental instability, in the following way (at ROS [16]-[23]):

""[16] The offender was 34 years old at the time of the offence and is now 36 years old. He never met his mother or father and was brought up by an aunt. There may be a history of mental illness in the family. He witnessed a lot of violence during his formative years. He was raped when he was 11 years old. He left school in year 8 and has done various jobs. He has had a number of sexual relationships, the most recent one of eight years' duration. He has a son.

[17] The offender has a long history of drug use, mental instability and offending. A report of Dr Jonathon Adams, forensic psychiatrist, was tendered. He interviewed the offender on 19 January 2011. The offender described to Dr Adams his contact with mental health services and symptoms he had experienced since his early 20s. He gave accounts of hearing voices, some scary, bad and dark, others beautiful, according to his mood. He described a man or group he thought were out to get him. He described odd smells and tastes, paranoia over a long period of years and referential thinking towards the television. He thought at one time that he was an alien female. He experienced sweating, tremor and anxious thoughts. He gave a history of mood instability since childhood, impaired ability to control his mood and impulsiveness. He said that he had made five suicide attempts in various ways. He had harmed himself.

[18] Describing his mental state during the time leading up to his arrest, the offender said that he was taking prescribed Oxycontin and adding more, illicitly obtained, as well as five bongs of cannabis per day. He was unsure about other drugs. He could not think straight. He was hearing voices and experiencing other symptoms of mental illness that he could not clearly describe. He said that his friends had told him that he was paranoid, though he himself seemed unable to remember.

[19] Dr Adams had seen a videotape of the offender's interview with investigating police officers and asked him why he had denied being intoxicated at the time. The offender replied that he had done so on Vickery's advice so that the Oxycontin prescription would not be terminated. He said that he was hearing voices during the police interview, and when Dr Adams said that that was not how he appeared, he said that he was trying to keep a straight face.

[20] Throughout the greater part of his interview with Dr Adams the offender maintained limited eye contract. He was slightly drowsy at times. He was not hostile. During the last ten minutes of the interview he became suspicious and asked whether Dr Adams was involved in a recent transfer of the offender from one gaol to another. When Dr Adams asked why, he said that 'James' had told him. He would not enlarge on that statement. He did not appear to Dr Adams to be responding to external stimuli. His speech seemed to lack spontaneity. His voice was low and sometimes slurred. There was no evidence of formal thought disorder. The offender said that he believed that psychotic medication and the assistance of the mental health services had been beneficial.

[21] Dr Adams reviewed reports of other psychiatrists who had had the care of the offender, namely Dr Sinclair and Professor Greenberg. Both had described psychotic symptoms and disorder, though in different particularities. Dr Adams also reviewed the offender's Justice Health medical records.

[22] The offender's first contact with the mental health services was when he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital at Shellharbour in his 20s. He was admitted to that hospital twice more, but had very little contact with the mental health services between admissions. He was prescribed Olanzapine and Quetiapine, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. When not in hospital he generally failed to comply with medical advice to take drugs.

[23] The offender has used illegal drugs over most of his life, beginning at age 6 or 7 years with cannabis. He progressed to hallucinogenic drugs and began using heroin when he was 25 years old. He consumed alcohol as well. In 2006 his general practitioner placed him on a gradually reducing dose of Oxycontin. So he ended his use of heroin.""

Some Other Findings of the Sentencing Judge Relevant to the Grounds of Appeal

17Barr AJ made the following findings concerning the Applicant's state of mind at the time of the offence (at ROS [10]-[14]):

""[10] The evidence shows that both the offender and the deceased were affected by the drugs they had consumed. Samples taken from the deceased's body show a level of Oxycodone sufficient to cause lethargy and mental clouding. There is no such evidence about the offender, but I am prepared to accept that he and the deceased probably consumed drugs at about the same rate during the hours immediately before the murder and that as a result the offender's thinking was probably clouded and his judgment and self-control affected.

[11] It was submitted that in the circumstances the deceased's accusation that the offender had stolen his drugs and should make restitution was akin to provocation and mitigated the offender's criminality.

[12] I can understand that a person falsely accused of theft might, out of indignation or outrage, act as he might not otherwise act, especially with clouded judgment and loss of self-control. But the evidence does not establish that the deceased's accusation was false. I do not think that the offender could point to his overreaction to a just accusation as mitigating his criminality. On the state of the evidence, I am unable to accept the submission.

[13] In seizing the knife and cutting and stabbing the deceased, the offender acted in response to the words that the deceased had spoken and in the heat of the moment. There was no premeditation.

[14] I do not regard the fact that the offender's acts resulted from the effect of drugs on his judgment and self control as mitigating his criminality. He voluntarily took the drugs and must accept the consequences.""

18The sentencing Judge noted the submission by senior counsel for the Applicant at first instance, that the need to impose a sentence having a generally deterrent effect ought be tempered by the Applicant's underlying mental condition. Having described that condition by reference to the report of Dr Adams, Barr AJ continued, with the passage (at ROS [27]) being challenged on appeal in this Court:

""[26] It seems to me that the offender's troublesome repeated behavioural problems result when, released from supervision, he ceases taking prescribed medicine and symptoms of mental illness reappear. Whether or how his further use of illegal drugs exacerbates his symptoms may not matter. The pattern seems well established.""

[27] While I am prepared to accept that the offender's mental illness may slightly lessen the need for a deterrent sentence, it seems to me that the same consideration gives rise to a greater need to impose a sentence that protects the public from the prospect of further offences, such has been the readiness of the offender continually to re-offend. To my mind this latter consideration outweighs the former.""

19Barr AJ found that the Applicant had a ""slight prospect of rehabilitation"" (at ROS [28]):

""[28] It was submitted that notwithstanding his serious history of offending, the offender had prospects of rehabilitation. Mr Hoyle pointed to records showing that the rates at which the offender had been punished for offences committed in custody had been lower during his latest incarceration than formerly. The record does show that over the years the offender has been dealt with many times for offences against gaol discipline and that he committed no infringement between 3 August 2009 and 26 April 2010. It seems possible that the offender may have begun to change his ways and that he may in the future begin to take responsibility for his actions. I note his statement to Dr Adams that he wishes to follow the medical advice he is offered, though one would not confidently predict success. The sentence I am obliged to impose is bound to incorporate a long non-parole period, and that will mean that by the time he is considered for parole the offender will be of a mature age and will have behind him a continuous period of supervision without, it is to be hoped, access to the drugs which have played such an important part of his life. I think that there is a slight prospect of rehabilitation.""

20His Honour found ""special circumstances"" (at ROS [29]):

""It was submitted that the Court ought to find special circumstances justifying an increase in the parole period of the sentence and a corresponding reduction in the non-parole period. Looking at the offender's episodes of crime, imprisonment, parole, freedom and return to crime, it is easy to justify a much longer period of parole than in a normal case of this kind. However, the Court cannot for that reason increase a sentence beyond that which the offence itself warrants. Neither can the court impose a non-parole period lower than that which the case objectively calls for. As a result, the court's discretion is limited, though I intend to exercise it in favour of the offender.""

21The sentencing Judge addressed the standard non-parole period, in a manner which is also challenged on appeal (at ROS [30]-[31]):

""[30] The standard non-parole period of 20 years for murder is to be imposed for an offence that falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of such offences. In my opinion this offence falls below the middle of the range because the offence was carried out in the heat of the moment, because the offender intended to do really serious bodily injury rather than to kill and because he has pleaded guilty.

[31] Having in mind the standard non-parole period and taking into account the matters I have mentioned, I think that the non-parole period should be 16 years. Taking into account the matters I have mentioned that justify a bias towards parole, I select a period of 8 years of eligibility for parole.""

Ground 1 - His Honour Erred in his Approach to the Applicant's Mental Illness and the Protection of the Public

Submissions of the Parties

22Mr Hamill SC, for the Applicant (who did not appear at first instance), challenged the approach of the sentencing Judge at ROS [26]-[29] (see [18]-[20] above) in support of this ground of appeal.

23It was submitted that, from his Honour's remarks in relation to general deterrence (at ROS [27]), it was accepted that the Applicant had a long-standing and serious psychiatric illness related to a deprived and abusive childhood, and the Applicant's involvement in illegal drugs at an extremely young age.

24Mr Hamill SC submitted that the Applicant's psychiatric condition was relevant to the sentencing exercise in a number of ways. Despite this, he submitted that the only way in which the sentencing Judge had taken the matter into account was by accepting that general deterrence may be less important and by, in effect, disregarding that factor on the basis that it was outweighed by the need to protect the public from future offending. 

25Given the length of the sentence to be imposed and the other matters that led the sentencing Judge to conclude that the Applicant had some (albeit slight) prospects of rehabilitation, it was submitted that it was erroneous to diminish or offset the important finding in relation to general deterrence. 

26Further, Mr Hamill SC submitted that the sentencing Judge did not refer to the impact of the Applicant's psychiatric condition with respect to the Applicant's moral culpability, to personal deterrence and the question whether a prison sentence would weigh more heavily upon him.

27It was submitted that the effective finding of dangerousness, which led to his Honour's conclusion of the importance of protection of the public, disclosed error because of the impossibility of assessing future dangerousness in circumstances where a very lengthy minimum term was to be imposed: Bugmy v The Queen [1990] HCA 18; 169 CLR 525 at 537.

28The Crown submitted that the findings made by the sentencing Judge were open in the circumstances of the case. It was stressed that it was for the Applicant to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that he was suffering from a mental disorder at the relevant time and that it should (or should not) be taken into account in a particular way.

29The Crown observed that senior counsel appearing for the Applicant at first instance had conceded that it could not be demonstrated that there was a clear connection between the Applicant's mental state and the commission of the offence, although he submitted that it remained open to the Court to have regard to the Applicant's mental condition in determining whether he was a suitable vehicle for imposing ""a deterrent aspect or a full deterrent aspect on the sentence"" (T14, 25 February 2011).

30It was observed as well that senior counsel at first instance did not submit that a custodial sentence might weigh more heavily on the Applicant because of his mental condition

31The Crown submitted that it was open to his Honour to approach the sentencing of the Applicant in this way, given the different ways in which an offender's mental condition may bear upon sentence, at times in a manner unfavourable to the offender. 

Decision

32It is for the Applicant to demonstrate error in the approach taken by the sentencing Judge in the manner alleged in the first ground of appeal.

33Where it is said that an offender suffers from a mental condition or disorder, this may bear upon the question of sentence in a number of different ways, depending upon the circumstances of the case. As Gleeson CJ observed in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 69, it is erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances such as a mental disorder. 

34Court decisions in this area have identified a number of ways in which the presence of a mental condition or disorder may bear upon the question of sentence. A helpful summary of these factors appears in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 43 [177]:

""Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing: see, eg, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Tsiarias [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40]-[48]; Lauritsen v R [2000] WASCA 203 ; (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [43]-[51]; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35]-[45]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[36]; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32]; Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14]-[18]; and R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. They can be summarised in the following manner:

· Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]; Miller v R [1999] WASCA 66 at [23]; R v Jiminez [1999] WASCA 7 at [23], [25]; Tsiaras at 400; Lauritsen at [51]; Israil at [23]; R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]; Henry at [28].

· It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed: Engert at 71; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50-51; Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]; Henry at [28].

· It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced: Tsiaris at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]; Henry at [28].

· It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence: Courtney at [14]; Tsiaras at 400; Israil at [25]; JW at [192].

· Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence: Israil at [24]; Henry at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public: R v Lawrence (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23]-[24].""

35In the present case, most experienced senior counsel appearing for the Applicant on sentence in the Supreme Court expressly disavowed the first factor and made no submission with respect to the third factor identified above. This is significant when findings are challenged on appeal to this Court. In Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL, I said at [79]-[81]:

""79 This Court is a court of error. The jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with a sentencing decision is exercisable only where there can be seen to have been an error of principle, or some other mistake of fact or law: R v Visconti [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 108. If material error is demonstrated, before the Court would proceed to resentence the Applicant, the Court must form a positive opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 720-721 [79]. It is, of course, a basic principle that, absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because (if it be the case) the Court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his or her discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15].

80 There is a practical expectation that an offender's legal representative will make submissions to the sentencing Judge at first instance, by reference to the particular factors which are sought to be taken into account in mitigation of sentence in the case at hand: Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [11]; Dyer v R [2011] NSWCCA 185 at [49]. ...

81 The Victorian Court of Appeal has emphasised recently, that in sentencing appeals, the Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment and not rehearing a plea of mitigation. It is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below. The Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea, and will have an even greater reluctance to entertain arguments that seek to resile from concessions made below or are a contradiction of submissions previously made. The Court spoke of the need for exceptional circumstances before this can be done, where it can be shown that there was most compelling material available on the plea that was not used or understood, and which demonstrates that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the plea and sentence: Romero v R [2011] VSCA 45 at [11]; Keane v R [2011] VSCA 156 at [13], [18]; Bayram v R [2012] VSCA 6 at [28]-[29].""

36The approach reflected in Zreika v R at [80]-[81] has been emphasised and applied by this Court, in circumstances where reliance was sought to be placed on appeal upon aspects of an offender's mental disorder which had been expressly eschewed by counsel at first instance: BT v R [2012] NSWCCA 128 at [20]-[26].

37The sentencing Judge made a finding (at ROS [10]) that the Applicant had consumed drugs before the murder and that, as a result, ""his thinking was probably clouded and his judgment and self-control affected"". This aspect did not assist the Applicant on sentence, being the product of self-induced intoxication.

38The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. Evidence which bore upon his mental condition, and its relevance to sentence, was based upon the report of Dr Adams, and the earlier report of Dr Sinclair relating to a different offence. 

39Of course, the reports were to be considered in conjunction with other evidence concerning the Applicant's history of violent crimes, against the background of his age and his significantly chequered history of recidivism upon release from custody. Considerations of this type clearly lay behind the sentencing Judge's approach (at ROS [26]-[29]) (see [18]-[20] above).

40The approach adopted by the experienced senior counsel who appeared for the Applicant at first instance was understandable. This was very much a case of the type referred to in R v Engert and R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48, where an offender's mental condition could operate in a manner favourable and unfavourable to him. 

41As senior counsel for the Applicant before Barr AJ conceded, the evidence did not support a submission that there was a causal connection between the Applicant's mental health and the offence. Nor was there evidence to support a submission that a custodial sentence would weigh more heavily on the Applicant because of his mental condition. No such submission was advanced at first instance.

42It should be observed, as well, that the Applicant's ""well established pattern"" of ceasing to take medication upon release combined with illicit drug use (ROS [26]) did not assist him on the issue of specific deterrence: R v Wright at 52; R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]-[33]; Clay v R [2007] NSWCCA 106 at [20]-[28].

43It is appropriate now to turn to the Applicant's submission based upon observations made in Bugmy v the Queen.

44Mr Hamill SC submitted that the sentencing Judge fell into error in his approach to protection of the community (at ROS [27]) as a factor on sentence of the Applicant. The focus of the submission was that, in the context of a sentencing decision made in 2011, where a lengthy sentence was to be imposed, no reliable assessment could be made concerning the dangerousness of the Applicant in many years' time. Counsel pointed to the following passage from the judgment of Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Bugmy v The Queen at 537:

""Although Brooking J clearly gave detailed consideration to the task he had to perform, it is hard to resist the conclusion that in his reasons his Honour was unduly influenced by considerations which bear on the fixing of a head sentence rather than on the minimum term. The risk that the applicant might reoffend was of course a relevant factor in fixing a minimum term. But a minimum term of eighteen years and six months is of such length as to take the prospects of reoffending in this case beyond even speculation. The applicant was twenty-seven years of age when the minimum term was fixed. He will be over forty-five before the likelihood that he will reoffend will become a matter for assessment. It is not possible to say now what the likelihood will be then. Equally, the applicant's behaviour in prison is a relevant consideration, but the longer the minimum term the less importance it must assume, simply because of the impossibility of making a forecast of future behaviour so far ahead. Again, while the desire on the part of his Honour to protect the community is material to the fixing of a minimum term as well as a head sentence, its significance must be the less the longer the minimum term, simply because relevant forecasts cannot be made at such a distance.""

45It is important to keep in mind that the sentencing Judge made the finding presently under challenge in the context of the relevance of the Applicant's mental condition to sentence. His Honour was prepared to accept (at ROS [27]) that the Applicant's mental disorder ""may slightly lessen the need for a deterrent sentence"", but went on to find that the Applicant's mental disorder gave rise ""to a greater need to impose a sentence that protects the public from the prospect of further offences, such has been the readiness of the offender continually to re-offend"", with the latter factor outweighing the former.

46It is well recognised that an offender's mental condition can operate in different directions on sentence, as Gleeson CJ emphasised in R v Engert.

47A fair reading of his Honour's remarks on sentence indicates that this was not a predominant factor on sentence. The slight lessening of a factor favourable to the Applicant was outweighed by a factor unfavourable to the Applicant. This was not a finding that a type of preventative detention was appropriate. As his Honour's observations during submissions (T18-19, 25 February 2011) and his remarks on sentence (ROS [29]) make clear, he was alive to the fact that a sentence disproportionate to the objective gravity of the crime could not be imposed.

48The protection of the community from an offender is one of the purposes of sentencing: s.3A(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Of course, this is but one of the purposes of sentencing which include, amongst other things, ensuring that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences and the promotion of rehabilitation of the offender: s.3A(a), (b) and (d) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

49The purposes stated in s.3A are the familiar, overlapping and, at times, conflicting, purposes of criminal punishment under the common law: Veen v The Queen (No. 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 476-477; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 129 [20]. 

50Although it may be said that the longer the minimum term under consideration, the greater the difficulty in making a satisfactory prediction about the future progress of an offender and the danger which the offender would present to the community, it remains the responsibility of a sentencing Judge to take account of the need to protect the community, and to make an assessment of the material before the Court, including an assessment of the offender's prospects of rehabilitation: Bugmy v The Queen at 532 (Mason CJ and McHugh J).

51In Fardon v Attorney-General for the State of Queensland [2004] HCA 46; 223 CLR 575, Gleeson CJ observed at 589 [11]:

""As was pointed out in Engert [(1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68], people suffering from mental disorders frequently come into collision with the criminal justice system, and discretionary sentencing decisions must take into account a number of sometimes competing considerations, including the protection of society. The law is a normative science, and many of its rules and principles are based upon assumptions about volition that would not necessarily be accepted as accurate by psychiatrists.""

52In the same case, Gleeson CJ noted at 589-590 [12]:

""The way in which the criminal justice system should respond to the case of the prisoner who represents a serious danger to the community upon release is an almost intractable problem. No doubt, predictions of future danger may be unreliable, but, as the case of Veen shows, they may also be right. Common law sentencing principles, and some legislative regimes, permit or require such predictions at the time of sentencing, which will often be many years before possible release.""

53The courts have recognised the imprecise nature of the process which involves an assessment of an offender's risk of reoffending, in particular where a lengthy sentence is to be imposed so that there is no prospect of the offender being released into the community at an early time. It has been emphasised that it is the risk of reoffending which is under consideration: R v SLD [2003] NSWCCA 310; 58 NSWLR 589 (special leave to appeal refused: SLD v The Queen [2004] HCA Trans 501); R v Johnson [2005] NSWCCA 186 at [13]; Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; 164 A Crim R 126 at 141 [30]; Adanguidi v R [2006] NSWCCA 404; 167 A Crim R 295 at 309 [55]; R v Willmott [2012] NSWSC 824 at [30].

54This is not a case where an assessment of future dangerousness was made by the sentencing Judge solely or principally by reference to the circumstances of the crime itself: cf Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227 at [59]-[73]. 

55The Applicant stood to be sentenced for the crime of murder. A substantial sentence of imprisonment was inevitable, both by way of minimum term and full term. 

56The statement in Bugmy v The Queen relied upon by the Applicant does not lead to the position where a sentencing Judge ought be reluctant to attempt an assessment of the risk of an offender reoffending at a future time. As the authorities have emphasised, it remains part of the responsibility of a sentencing Judge to have regard to this factor on sentence, although there is, of necessity, a significant element of imprecision to it. 

57The Applicant was not a young offender. Nor was he a person with no prior involvement with the criminal justice system, who had committed a very serious crime (as in Ng v R). 

58The Applicant was 34 years of age at the time of the offence and 36 years' old at the time of sentence. His criminal history revealed the commission of serious offences of violence over many years, with a range of sentencing options being utilised. There were breaches of conditional liberty, exemplified by breach of recognisance in 2000 and revocation of parole in 2004 and 2005. 

59The Applicant's most serious crimes of violence were those most recently committed by him - malicious wounding in 2006 and murder in 2008. 

60There was little in the psychiatric reports before the sentencing Judge which assisted the Applicant on the question of recidivism. The evidence pointed to an entrenched pattern of substance use and abuse. 

61The sentencing Judge concluded that the Applicant had a ""slight prospect of rehabilitation"" (at ROS [28]). 

62I detect no error in principle in his Honour's approach to sentence. An assessment concerning the Applicant's prospect of recidivism was a necessary part of the sentencing process. By March 2011, the Applicant had demonstrated an entrenched pattern of recidivism involving escalating crimes of violence, culminating in murder, the most serious crime of violence in our law. 

63The assessment undertaken by the sentencing Judge involved consideration of what the Applicant had done in the past over a number of years, which was capable of shedding significant light upon his prospects for the future, even many years hence.

64As mentioned earlier, the sentencing Judge was considering this issue in the limited context of the relevance of the Applicant's mental condition to sentence. It was open to his Honour to form the view that the Applicant's mental condition ""may slightly lessen the need for a deterrent sentence"" but, at the same time, to conclude that the protection of the community given the Applicant's risk of reoffending, outweighed the favourable use of his mental condition on the issue of deterrence.

65In due course, his Honour fixed a head sentence with a non-parole period significantly less than the statutory ratio under s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The aspects arising from the Applicant's mental condition contributed to the fixing of a non-parole period which allowed a significant opportunity to the Applicant by way of release on parole in the future.

66His Honour's approach reflects the process of instinctive synthesis to be undertaken on sentence, where the sentencing Judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence and then makes a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence in all the circumstances of the case: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 377-378 [51]; Muldrock v The Queen at 131-132 [26].

67It has not been demonstrated that the process undertaken by the sentencing Judge, or the sentencing outcome itself, indicates that a disproportionate sentence was imposed because of the conclusion reached with respect to the Applicant's risk of recidivism. 

68It was open to the sentencing Judge, in the exercise of discretion, to approach the issue of the Applicant's mental condition in the manner revealed in the remarks on sentence. No error has been demonstrated in this respect.

69I would reject the first ground of appeal.

Ground 2 - Suggested Error in the Sentencing Judge's Approach to the Standard Non-Parole Period

Submissions of the Parties

70Mr Hamill SC submitted that error was demonstrated in the use of the standard non-parole period by the sentencing Judge at ROS [30]-[31] (see [21] above). It was submitted that this approach infringed what the High Court of Australia later identified as the correct approach on sentence for a standard non-parole offence in Muldrock v The Queen. Counsel submitted that an impermissible two-stage approach was adopted on sentence with the standard non-parole period of 20 years being treated, in effect, as a starting point. 

71The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had not adopted a two-stage or two-tiered process of sentencing and that the finding that the Applicant's offence fell ""below the middle of the range"" was not erroneous.

Determination

72In Aldous v R [2012] NSWCCA 153, Davies J (Allsop P and Latham J agreeing) said at [31]:

""This is another in an increasingly long line of cases where sentences imposed prior to the High Court's decision in Muldrock are challenged as falling foul of what was said in that judgment. Some of the cases are collected in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [36] and see also this Court's comments in Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 140 at [26]. As Johnson J said in Zreika at [43], it is necessary to read fairly the entirety of a Sentencing Judge's Remarks to see how the standard non-parole period has been dealt with. As in Zreika the Sentencing Judge in the present case determined that the standard non-parole period was only to operate as a benchmark or guidepost in the exercise of her sentencing discretion. It cannot be said that it has been used as a starting point when her Remarks are fairly considered. Her use of the words 'the consequence' do not lead to the result that it was the starting point. Her approach of using the standard non-parole period as a benchmark or guidepost is consistent with the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock: Zreika at [43].""

73The present appeal may be added to the ""long line of cases"" mentioned by Davies J in Aldous v R. 

74It is necessary to fairly read the relevant part of his Honour's remarks on sentence. 

75In addition, it is appropriate to refer to the submissions advanced at first instance by the most-experienced senior counsel then appearing for the Applicant. It was there submitted for the Applicant that the standard non-parole period constituted a ""sign post"" or an ""indicator"" and that the Applicant's offence was ""below mid range seriousness"" (T14.39, 25 February 2011).

76The sentencing Judge has adopted the defence submission advanced on sentence in the assessment of the offence as ""below the middle of the range"". 

77Although reference to the Applicant's plea of guilty in the context of an assessment of objective seriousness (at the end of ROS [30]) may be inapt, this ought be taken as recognition of the then applicable approach to the standard non-parole period following a plea of guilty: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168.

78It has not been demonstrated that his Honour used the standard non-parole period as a starting point, nor that a two-staged approach to sentencing was applied. His Honour considered the objective gravity of the Applicant's offence as part of the process of instinctive synthesis leading to the sentence imposed: Zreika v R at [46].

79I am not persuaded that error has been demonstrated in his Honour's approach to the standard non-parole period in this case. Even if error had been demonstrated (and it has not), the intervention of this Court is not warranted.

80I would reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 3 - Claim that a Different Less Severe Sentence is Warranted and Ought to have Been Imposed

81This ground is expressed in the well-recognised terms of a finding, consequential upon the establishment of error, that a lesser sentence is warranted for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. However, submissions with respect to the ground were directed, as well, to a claim of manifest excess in sentence. 

82Clearly, this Court does not reach an assessment under s.6(3) unless error has otherwise been established so as to trigger the Court considering that statutory question: Zreika v R at [79] (see [35] above). In circumstances where error has not been established in the first or second grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to consider this ground as one claiming that a manifestly excessive sentence was imposed.

Submissions of the Parties

83Mr Hamill SC submitted that there were two significant features of this case which pointed to the necessity for imposition of a lesser sentence. Firstly, there was no premeditation and, secondly, there was no intention to kill. He submitted that, as a general principle, murder resulting from an intention to do grievous bodily harm is not as objectively serious as murder involving an intention to kill. 

84Mr Hamill SC pointed as well to what he described as the Applicant's sad personal history and his plea of guilty which, taken with other relevant factors, ought lead to the conclusion that a lesser sentence ought to have been imposed.

85In support of this ground, Mr Hamill SC furnished a schedule of murder sentencing cases which, he submitted, demonstrated the excessive nature of the Applicant's sentence. 

86The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed upon the Applicant was not unreasonable or plainly unjust and that, in any event, no lesser sentence is warranted in law.

87The Crown noted that senior counsel for the Applicant at first instance had handed up a schedule of cases obtained from the Public Defenders' data base, and that this schedule was utilised for the purpose of submissions. It was submitted to Barr AJ, for the Applicant, that an appropriate minimum term lay somewhere in the range of 12 to 15 years (T16, 25 February 2011). The Crown observed that the non-parole period ultimately fixed in this case (16 years) was just above the top of the range articulated by senior counsel for the Applicant before the sentencing Judge.

88The Crown submitted, as well, that a finding of special circumstances had been made, leading to the fixing of a non-parole period which represented 66.67% of the full term. 

89The Crown submitted that the table of cases relied upon by the Applicant in this Court did not support a contention that the sentence imposed upon him was manifestly excessive.

Determination

90In approaching this ground of appeal, I bear in mind that the Applicant's late plea of guilty attracted a discount of 10% on sentence. 

91The finding that the offence was below the mid-range involved acceptance of the submission made for the Applicant on sentence. 

92The sentencing Judge's conclusion that the Applicant intended to cause grievous bodily harm, and not to kill, contributed to the finding made concerning objective seriousness. Although it will generally be the case that an intention to cause grievous bodily harm is less culpable to a greater or lesser degree than an intention to kill in a case of murder, that is not always so, and there may be circumstances where an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm could reflect similar criminality to other cases involving an intention to kill: Tran v R [2011] NSWCCA 116 at [1], [44]-[45]. 

93That said, the finding with respect to intent in this case was, in my view, appropriately taken into account by his Honour in assessing the gravity of the Applicant's offence and in the calculation of sentence itself, as was the absence of premeditation.

94The sad but practical reality of this case was that the Applicant had almost nothing operating in his favour subjectively on sentence. 

95The Applicant's significant history of crimes of violence did not assist him: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at 574-575 [24]-[34]. 

96The Applicant's mental condition has been considered earlier in this judgment. The approach adopted by the sentencing Judge, which does not disclose error, meant that this factor had no real traction in a manner favourable to the Applicant in this case.

97The Applicant did not demonstrate shame or contrition beyond his plea of guilty (ROS [9]).

98I have had regard to the cases referred to by the Applicant as suggested comparable cases. Those decisions are R v O'Leary [2004] NSWSC 821; R v Heffernan [2005] NSWSC 739; Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290; R v Waters [2006] NSWSC 502; R v Harvey [2007] NSWSC 871; R v Thompson [2008] NSWSC 109; R v Pocock [2008] NSWSC 1435; R v Shamouil [2009] NSWSC 24; R v O'Donnell [2009] NSWSC 42; R v Edwards [2009] NSWSC 164; R v Carr [2009] NSWSC 995; R v Cox [2009] NSWSC 1067; R v Holcroft [2010] NSWSC 1294; R v Borg [2010] NSWSC 951; R v Jones [2010] NSWSC 432; R v Wong [2010] NSWSC 171 and Lee v R [2011] NSWCCA 169. In addition, I have had regard to Tran v R. 

99I have considered these various sentencing decisions in unrelated cases to which the Court's attention has been drawn, keeping in mind the limited approach referred to by the High Court in Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 536-537 [53]-[54]. 

100By asserting manifest excess, the Applicant alleges that the result embodied in the sentencing Judge's order was unreasonable or plainly unjust. The Applicant asserts that it was to be inferred from the result that there was a failure to properly exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the sentencing court: House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505.

101Appellate intervention on the ground that a sentence is manifestly excessive is not justified simply because (if it be the case) the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Rather, intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the reasons: Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 605 [58]; Hili v R at 538-539 [58]-[59]. That this Court may have exercised the sentencing discretion differently is not the test: Lowndes v R [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15].

102To the extent that it may in any event be relevant, there is no case amongst those relied upon by the Applicant that is especially close to the circumstances of this offence and this offender. 

103It is the case that the full term of imprisonment of 24 years imposed upon the Applicant is greater than the full term imposed upon any of the offenders in these cases. A head sentence of imprisonment for 24 years was imposed by this Court on a successful appeal by the offender in Tran v R.

104The non-parole period imposed, in a number of these cases, was close to or at the level of the non-parole period specified for the present Applicant: R v Wong (15 years and six months); R v Jones (16 years); R v Borg (16 years); R v Holcroft (17 years); R v Edwards (14 years); R v O'Donnell (16 years and six months); R v Shamouil (14 years and six months); R v Pocock (14 years and nine months); R v Thompson (15 years); R v Waters (15 years) and R v O'Leary (16 years). 

105What follows from an examination of these cases, and that of the Applicant, is that a substantial head sentence has been imposed in this case, with a non-parole period which provides the Applicant with a significant opportunity for release by way of conditional liberty. The finding of special circumstances, which led to the variation of the statutory ratio, operates in the Applicant's favour. 

106Having regard to the circumstances of the offence and the offender, I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed upon the Applicant was unreasonable or plainly unjust. It has not been demonstrated that the sentence is manifestly excessive.

107I would reject the third ground of appeal, both in its assertion that the sentence was manifestly excessive and its claim that some lesser sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed by reference to s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

Conclusion

108The Applicant has not demonstrated patent or latent error with respect to sentence. 

109I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal against sentence be dismissed.

110HAMMERSCHLAG J: I agree with Johnson J.

2417843,R. v. Michael Anthony Ryan (No. 8) [2012] NSWSC 1161,"ex tempore Judgment

1Mr Waterstreet has made two applications; the first is for a verdict by direction, and the second is for a ruling from me that the Crown case as it relates to manslaughter be left to the jury on the basis that the act of the accused founding the charge is a punch only, and no other form of striking such as pushing or forcibly releasing the deceased from a grapple. I should note that Mr Waterstreet has already flagged that he may make an application under s24 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) at the conclusion of the evidence. I am not dealing with that now.

2I am against Mr Waterstreet on the verdict by direction application, but I am with him in relation to the basis upon which the Crown case may be left to the jury.

Application for a verdict by direction

3It seems to me there are two difficulties with the application for a verdict by direction; the first is it's timing; and the second is its substance. As has been recounted elsewhere, Mr Waterstreet applied for a Prasad direction at the close of the Crown case, which application I acceded to. It seems inherent to me in such an application that there is an acknowledgement that the Crown case is legally sufficient to be considered by the jury; indeed, so much was said by Chief Justice King in R v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161 at 162:

The question whether there is a case to answer, which arises in a criminal trial at the close of the case for the prosecution, is a question whether on the evidence as it stands the accused could lawfully be convicted, that is to say, whether there is evidence with respect to every element of the offence charged which, if accepted, would prove that element.

4The learned Chief Justice referred to the familiar cases of May v. O'Sullivan (1955) 92 CLR 654 and Zanetti v. Hill (1962) 108 CLR 433. His Honour (at page 163) distinguished between that legal consideration and what has become known as the Prasad direction. The essence of the Prasad direction is to give the jury the opportunity to consider for themselves whether, at a factual level, the Crown evidence is sufficient to justify a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour pointed out that a verdict by direction is quite another matter. He said that where there is evidence which if accepted, is capable at law of proving the charge, a direction to bring in a verdict of not guilty would be a usurpation of the rights and functions of the jury.

5R v Pahuja (1987) 49 SASR 191 is another South Australian case dealing with the Prasad direction. In that case Chief Justice King said this at page 201:

...when the judge is of opinion that the evidence for the prosecution, although capable of law of supporting a conviction, is insufficiently cogent to justify a verdict of guilty [a Prasad direction may be given]. Even in such a case, the judge should bear in mind that the evidence called by the defence might strengthen the prosecution's case.

By that last statement it seems to me that his Honour had in mind that once the party goes into evidence it is inappropriate that there be a verdict by direction until the evidence is closed, given that once a party has commenced to give evidence, the prosecution is entitled to cross-examine in an attempt to elicit evidence that will strengthen its own case.

6This seems to me to be the basis for the rule familiar in civil cases that, in cases involving multiple defendants, no non-suit or verdict by direction can be given at the close of a plaintiff's case until all defendants have closed their cases: Wickstead v. Browne (1992) 30 NSWLR 1.

7In any event it seems to me that there is ample evidence, which, if accepted by the jury, and I acknowledge that reliability of the testimony of some of the witnesses is a live issue in the case, would justify a verdict adverse to the accused on both counts.

8I need not multiply examples, but the evidence of Mr Willis justifies, if the jury accept it, the case of assault against Mr Poile, notwithstanding the Crown's disavowal of Mr Poile as a reliable witness.

9So far as the much more serious charge of manslaughter is concerned, the evidence of both Mr Moody and Mr Miller justifies, if accepted, on the basis of the evidence elicited by the learned Crown Prosecutor pursuant to s38, a finding that it was a punch by the accused that caused the deceased to fall and strike his head heavily on the pavement.

10According to the expert evidence of Dr Wills, the heavy contact between the deceased's head and the pavement caused the severe traumatic brain injury from which Mr McLeod subsequently died.

11It seems to me that there can be no serious question that a punch is legally capable of being viewed by the jury as an unlawful and dangerous act for the purpose of the common law test laid down by the High Court in Wilson v. the Queen (1992) 174 CLR 313, relating to this form of manslaughter.

12I understand of course that there is a strong argument here of self-defence and that the Crown carry the onus of eliminating that consideration beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence which is capable, if accepted by the jury, of discharging that onus goes back as far as what happened in the mall. The evidence of Mr Willis and of some of hotel employees puts the accused in the position of aggressor. If that evidence were accepted by the jury, it would not only persuade them that the punch on Mr Poile was not in self-defence, but also would tend to prove that, in the circumstances occurring in the carpark, Mr Ryan was the one who took the opportunity to rekindle the animosity that had developed in the mall between him, on the one hand, and Mr McLeod and Mr Poile on the other. Moreover, if one accepted the evidence of Mr Moody in his recorded interview, and also the evidence adduced from Mr Miller in cross-examination by reference to his earlier police statement, one would come to the conclusion that Mr Ryan was acting as the aggressor.

13It is not relevant for me to consider whether that is a likely outcome at this stage, nor is it necessary for me at this stage, in any way, shape or form to weigh and assess the strength of the Crown case. It is sufficient that those observations I have made are firmly founded in the evidence that has been heard by the jury.

14In my view, bearing in mind what Chief Justice King said, were I at this stage to direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty I would be usurping their proper function. The function of the jury in deciding all questions of fact in the trial of serious criminal cases is not only fundamental to the common law, but it is often said to be of high significance in a general constitutional setting. Members of the community are not convicted of serious crimes other than on the judgment of their peers.



The Crown case

15I turn, then, to the question of the basis upon which the Crown case may be left to the jury. Twice in recent times the High Court of Australia has reflected upon the impact on a fair trial of permitting the prosecution to change the basis upon which the case is brought. Those cases are Patel v. the Queen [2012] HCA 29 and Burns v. the Queen [2012] HCA 35. It is a matter of interest that Burns v. the Queen was a case of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. Both were manslaughter cases. 

16In Kirk v Industrial Court (NSW) (2010) 239 CLR 531, five Justices of the High Court at page 557 paragraph 26 said: 

The common law requires that the defendant is entitled to be told not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he or she is charged, but also of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge (emphasis added) 

17Their Honours discussed the origin of the rule and referred to the earlier decision of High Court of Australia in a case that the learned Crown Prosecutor drew to my attention, Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467. In that case Dixon J, as his Honour then was, considered at 486 that an information must specify, the time, place and manner of the defendants' acts or omissions (emphasis added). McTiernan J at page 501 referred to the requirements of fair information and reasonable particularity as to the nature of the offence charged.

18In Kirk, the members of the plurality referred to the provisions of s11 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), which deals, in particular, with statutory offences. The Justices pointed out that in Smith v Moody [1903] 1 KB 56 it was held that provisions like s11 did not dispense with the common law rule. 

19Mr Waterstreet referred me to R v Mai & Anor (1992) 26 NSWLR 371 where Hunt CJ at CL, presiding in the Court of Criminal Appeal, at 377 and 378 referred to Johnson v Miller and like cases and cited, with approval, the following passage from Archibald's Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases, 14th edition, (1859): 

All the ingredients of the offence with which the defendant is charged, the facts, circumstances and intent constituting it, must be set forth with certainty and precision (emphasis added). 

The reference to setting forth is a reference to setting forth, inter alia, in an indictment; although this is no mere point of pleading, but a fundamental aspect of a common law right enjoyed by every person charged with a criminal offence.

20In opening his case the learned prosecutor at 42T.10 pointed out to the jury that it was for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt the essential elements which go to make up the charge of manslaughter.

21Although at 42T.25, the learned prosecutor referred, generally, to the conduct of the accused, he said at 43T.15:

Lastly, the Crown must satisfy you that the act, that is the punching, done by Mr Ryan on this occasion, was an unlawful and dangerous act.

22There was further discussion about this matter on 24 August 2012. I will not set it all out, but Mr Waterstreet properly sought, as it were, to pin the prosecution down as to the case which Mr Ryan had to meet. After some debate at page 214T.5, I asked this question:

""... but the Crown case, Mr Crown, is there was one punch? 

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No. The Crown case is that the particulars that the Crown rely on is a punch by Mr Ryan which caused the deceased to fall backwards and dying of injury. Whether there was a punch prior to that, one would think it is a matter for the jury. The Crown has just got to particularise the transaction on which we rely and that is the punch which caused the fall...""

23It should be said that there is further context in which those statements should be understood, and that is to say, that Mr Ryan has maintained since 1 May 2011, when he was first interviewed by police, that he acted in self-defence. He also admitted, as he did in evidence before the jury on Monday 17 September 2012, that he did punch Mr McLeod. But on his evidence the punch that he delivered, done in self-defence, did not cause Mr McLeod to fall; rather, Mr Ryan's version has always been that another act, that is pushing Mr McLeod away, it seems in one way or another, is the last striking by him of Mr McLeod before Mr McLeod fell.

24It seems to me it has always been an important part of the defence case to draw this distinction between a punch and another form of striking, and that distinction explains Mr Waterstreet's insistence on having the act relied upon by the Crown particularised in clear and unequivocal terms.

25Now, I can well accept that in the circumstance of a given case that a push or an act of disentangling oneself from a grapple, could legally be capable of being a dangerous act, as that expression is understood in the common law of Australia, as I have said, by reference to the decision of the High Court in Wilson v. the Queen but that is not to the point. The point is that Mr Ryan is entitled to know at the very outset the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge. This is especially so as the indictment in this case is couched in the most general terms: 

On 4 May 2011 at Windsor in the State of New South Wales Michael Anthony Ryan did unlawfully kill Connan McLeod in circumstances amounting to manslaughter.

26There is a reference to s18 (i)(b) of the Crimes Act. By reference to s11 of the Criminal Procedure Act, no-one says that the indictment is invalid, or in some other way insufficient to support the trial that has been conducted over the last five weeks. But in circumstances where the issues have been so clearly defined before the start of the trial, and where the indictment was couched in such general terms, I think it would be prejudicial to Mr Ryan's right to a fair trial on this charge to allow the case of the Crown to go to the jury other than on the basis that the act relied upon as unlawful and dangerous is a punch and no other form of striking. I so rule.

		26 September 2012",2012-09-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2417909,"ROSS, James John v R [2012] NSWCCA 207","Judgment
1ALLSOP P:  This is an appeal by Mr Ross under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1), against convictions on 24 counts of sexual offences after a jury trial concluding on 9 November 2009.  
2Sentence was passed on 11 June 2010.  The notice of appeal was filed in August 2011.
3At the time of the offences the appellant was in his mid-twenties, a truck driver and a casual friend of the mother of the complainant.  Their relationship was a sexual one.
4The appellant and the mother faced trial together upon an indictment containing 34 charges of sexual offences relating to the daughter, who was at the time 13 years of age.  The offences were said to have taken place in three episodes and at three locations.
5Counts 1 to 10 related to offences with which the appellant and the mother were jointly charged and which occurred at Tilbuster near Armidale between 1 January and 1 February 2004.
6Counts 11 to 17 also related to offences with which the appellant and the mother were jointly charged.  These occurred at Yamba between 26 April and 16 July 2004.  The appellant was charged alone in count 18 with an offence also said to have occurred at Yamba between those dates.
7Counts 19 to 34 related to offences with which the appellant and the mother were severally charged and which occurred at Beresfield on or about 5 September 2004.  In relation to these offences the appellant was charged as a principal (counts 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33) and the mother as an accessory before the fact (counts 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32 and 34).
8There was a joint trial in September 2008 before a judge of the District Court (Black DCJ) and jury at Lismore.  Black DCJ refused an application for a separate trial.  The complainant's evidence was given by video and a record was kept of it.  Both the appellant and the mother gave evidence at that trial.  The jury was discharged following alleged impropriety during deliberations.
9On the re-trial before Woods DCJ, the ruling as to a joint trial was not canvassed.  The complainant's evidence at the first hearing and the record of two interviews that she gave to the police (24 October and 8 November 2005) were read to the jury.  The appellant's and the mother's evidence from the earlier trial was tendered by the Crown.  Neither the appellant nor the mother gave or called any evidence in their cases at the re-trial.
10It is important to note at this point that while the evidence of the appellant and the mother was admissible against each other at the first joint trial, the evidence of each at the retrial was only evidence against them individually.  This was potentially productive of difficulty since there were important inconsistencies in their evidence.  Most importantly, in relation to the second episode at Yamba, the mother said that, after having taken some time to have a shower and taking some drugs, she re-entered the living room to find the appellant and the complainant naked on the sofa bed with the complainant having a vibrator inside her vagina.  The mother said that she protested and began to dance flirtatiously to distract attention from the daughter.  The appellant denied that these events took place, denied any sexual contact with the complainant and denied being naked.  I will return to the evidence shortly.  It should be noted that there was no objection to the reading of the accuseds' evidence to the jury on the retrial.  Clear directions were given about its use.  There was no revival of any application for a separate trial.
11The appellant and the mother were both found not guilty of the joint charge in count 15, which was a charge of sexual assault (fellatio) aggravated by threats of actual bodily harm by means of an offensive weapon (a knife).  The appellant was found not guilty of count 18, a charge he faced alone, being an allegation of penile vaginal intercourse.  On all other counts, the appellant and the mother were found guilty.
12The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of eight years commencing on 16 October 2009 with a balance of term of four years.  There is no application in relation to the sentence.
13The following recounting of the facts is taken from the Crown's submissions and Summary of Trial drawn in large part from the complainant's evidence prepared by the Crown, to which no objection was taken by the appellant.
Background
14The appellant was a long distance truck driver.  He struck up a sexual relationship with the complainant's mother.  He visited her from time to time and they shared interests in sex and drugs.  At the relevant time, 2004, she was a heavy abuser of the drug known as ""ice"" (methamphetamine) and marijuana.  His indulgence in drugs appears to have been limited to using methamphetamine and the like to keep him awake when driving, and he was able to supply her with certain drugs from time to time.  The mother was divorced.  Torn between her parents who had broken up, in part a result of the mother's heavy drug abuse, the complainant, around the summer holidays of early 2004, was eager to leave Sydney and live with her mother, at least for a while.  It was during this period, a time of heavy drug use by her mother, that the complainant came in contact with the appellant and these offences occurred.
The Tilbuster episode
15Count 1 alleged an act of indecency at Tilbuster; there the appellant was said to be naked on a lounge playing with his penis in her presence.  Count 2 involved the mother dancing about using a vibrator upon herself in the presence of the complainant, again an act of indecency charge.  Counts 3, 4 and 5 involved the appellant inserting vibrator into the vagina of the complainant, contravening s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (sexual intercourse without consent of the girl aged thirteen).  Count 6 was a charge of indecent assault, of the appellant sucking the child's breasts; count 7, penetration of the vagina with his fingers; count 8, licking her vagina; count 9 was like conduct involving the mother as well.  Count 10 was the culmination of these events in the house at Tilbuster when the child came back into the bedroom where the appellant and the mother were, and the appellant ejaculated over both of them.  That was an indecent assault.
The Yamba episode
16The offences at Yamba included count 11, being another episode of sex between the two where the child became involved.  The act of indecency consisted of the mother using a vibrator on herself in the presence of the complainant and the appellant, the latter of whom had tied the mother to a bed in some sexual byplay at a time when the mother was severely affected by drugs.  The appellant licked the child's vagina (count 12) and penetrated her with his fingers (count 13), this amounting in law to sexual intercourse.  The appellant made the child masturbate his penis, constituting the indecent assault in count 14.  Count 16 was an act of indecency with the mother again using vibrators on herself in the presence of the child.  Count 17 was another act of indecency involving the mother's vagina in the presence of the child.
17Count 15 (of which both the appellant and the mother were acquitted) was said to have involved the appellant threatening the complainant with a knife in order to coerce her to perform fellatio upon him.
18Count 18 concerned a charge only against the appellant.  It was alleged to have occurred on the Sunday morning following the events of the previous evening.  The mother was at church.  The appellant was alleged to have forcibly had sex with the complainant.
The Beresfield episode
19Later in 2004, at a point in time when the relationship between the appellant and the mother had altered and the latter had made some efforts to minimise the quantity of drugs she was abusing, an event occurred when the mother took the complainant to Sydney to see her father, from whom the mother was estranged.  The arrangement was that the mother would go off with her new partner on some social activity, which apparently she did.  Beforehand she had arranged to meet up with the appellant (who was still driving trucks) at a point near the Wahroonga turn-off to the north of Sydney on the freeway to Newcastle.  There, it was alleged by arrangement with the appellant, the mother put the young girl into the cabin of the truck with the appellant, who went off on a road trip.  During the course of that trip he put his hands onto her vaginal area and the offences in counts 19 and 20 were committed.  He put her hand on his penis and the offences in counts 21 and 22 were committed.  In the course of the trip he arrived at the BP service station at Beresfield and parked.  It was there that he touched the complainant on the vagina and counts 23 and 24 were committed.  There was further sexual contact between him and her, touching on her breast and placing her hand on her own vagina; counts 25, 26, 27 and 28 were thereby committed.  Further on in the course of this enterprise, he digitally penetrated her vagina (counts 29 and 30) and her anus (counts 31 and 32).  Then there was fellatio and counts 33 and 34 were committed.
20The appellant then drove back to Sydney where they met up with the mother late at night.  The mother asked the child what had happened, to which the girl replied ""Everything, thanks to you"".  The complainant's evidence was that her mother replied ""Let's not talk about it ever again, and if you do you're not my daughter.  Don't tell anyone"".
Complaint
21The complainant in 2005 told her mother's former employer, a Ms Rosita Churchill, and her father that she had been sexually assaulted by a truck driver who worked for Lindsay Bros.  She also said that her mother was not involved.  She said that she said this because she loved her mother and did not want to get her into trouble.  The complainant's father informed the police.  When she found out that he had done this, the complainant became angry, telling him that she loved her mother.  The complainant then went to the police and said that everything that she had said was a lie.  She said this because she feared she would not be allowed to live with her mother, which she still wanted to do.  Later, the mother became hysterical and threatened violence against Ms Churchill when the complainant said that she wanted to stay with Ms Churchill.  At this point the complainant, with Ms Churchill, approached the police for an apprehended violence order.  It was also at about this point that the complainant told the police of what had happened and of her mother's involvement, although she said that she did not want police involvement but counselling.
22The complainant had been a regular user of marijuana during 2003 and 2004.  She said that while it made her paranoid and fearful, she did not have hallucinations or believe that bad things had happened to her which had not happened.  She was still smoking marijuana when she made the complaint to Ms Churchill and her father, but had stopped by the time she spoke with police.
23The complainant admitted that she had been violent towards other students at her school.  While she considered herself independent and did what she wanted to do, she was scared of not having a mother and scared of her mother not loving her.
Ground 1 - Separate trials
24The appellant and the mother were jointly charged with a number of the offences.  In the ordinary course one would not expect them to be tried separately:  R v Demirok [1976] VR 244 at 254; Demirok v R [1977] HCA 21; 137 CLR 20; and see generally R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 at [199]-[212].  The danger that may exist is by the admission of evidence against one only of the accused.  This risk is to be obviated by express and careful directions as to the use of evidence:  R v Harbach (1973) 6 SASR 427 at 433.  There is a public interest in the avoidance of the risk of inconsistent verdicts, of inconvenience to witnesses, and in ensuring finality is reached as expeditiously as possible by having one trial.   The interests of justice in this respect are not limited to those of the accused:  Demirok; Webb and Hay v R [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41 at 89.
25In R v Baartman (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ, Powell JA and Smart J, 6 October 1994, unreported), the Chief Justice accepted as stating the relevant principles what Hunt J had said in R v Middis (Supreme Court of NSW, 27 March 1991, unreported):
""1.Where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and
2.where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him; and
3.where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material,
a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant.  The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.""

26There is a balance to be struck between the public interest and any prejudice to the accused, relevant to which assessment is whether there is positive injustice to the accused:  R v Dellapatrona (1993) 31 NSWLR 123 at 133.
27The application made before Black DCJ prior to the commencement of the trial before him was that there should be separate trials because of prejudicial evidence that was admissible against the mother but not against the appellant.  That evidence was in the form of telephone intercepts and listening device records made in 2007.
28Some time had been taken in investigating the allegations and finding the appellant.  The complainant had not lived with her mother for over a year when she spoke to the complainant in telephone calls and a meeting that were (obviously without the knowledge of the mother) recorded.
29At the appeal, counsel for the appellant relied specifically upon parts of the transcript.  I will go beyond what counsel relied on in these reasons.

35There is no clear admission by the mother in the above evidence; what it lacks, however, is a clear denial of the events taking place, other than making the complainant go in the truck with the appellant.
36The reasons given by Black DCJ for not separating the trial were as follows: 
""The overall background is that both accused face allegations of sexual impropriety, to put it as neutrally as I can, made by the complainant.  There is some medical evidence, not, of course, implicating either of the accused but consistent with something having happened to the private parts of the complainant at the relevant time.  There is general surrounding evidence indicating a relationship, I am told, I have not gone into the strength of it, between the two accused.  What is said by Mr O'Connor [counsel for Mr Ross] is that, in particular, there are apparent concessions by the accused [mother] that she needs counselling treatment as a result of sexual activities including her daughter, the complainant.  There is, further, an assertion in the listening device transcript by [the mother] that drugs had been administered to her by the accused James John Ross.  That is the height of it.  Mr O'Connor says that there is going to be an inference drawn that the complainant's account of sexual impropriety involving at least her mother and, of course, on the complainant's account, the accused James John Ross, is therefore going to be supported improperly against James John Ross, is therefore going to be supported improperly against James John Ross by these remarks by the mother in the listening device transcript.  He further went on to say, although not expressly this afternoon, that it may be that there is a cut throat defence here and that is capable of giving rise to injustice between the two accused.
I fail to see anything particularly unusual about the matters that I have had drawn to my attention.  I do not see that ordinary directions would be incapable of dealing with the admissibility of evidence as far as each of the accused is concerned.  I have had sufficient time to form a view about the calibre of juries in this area and, in my view, they are conscientious and very careful to listen to legal directions and, in my experience, to act in accordance with them so far as I can tell.  This is not as a result of any private questioning of jurors, it is my observance of the cases conducted in this court and the way the juries appear to approach them and their general manner and the questions they asked.  I see no problem at all in juries understanding the relevance of evidence in relation to each separate accused and I see no reason to think that the particular matters complained of here would make it in any way impossible or improbable for them to carry out observance of directions to treat each accused separately and the admissibility of evidence separately.  Accordingly I am, to put it either way, in my view, I am satisfied that a joint trial would not cause positive injustice to Mr Ross with great respect to the matters argued by Mr O'Connor and, therefore, the application is refused.""

37As I have indicated above at [9], the question of a separate trial for the appellant was not canvassed before Woods DCJ at the second trial of this matter, which is the relevant trial for this appeal.  I do not think that Black DCJ's discretion miscarried.  He took into account all relevant considerations.  At the second trial, Woods DCJ gave clear directions as to the use of the material:  that it could not be employed against the appellant.  No complaint was made about those directions.
38Nevertheless, the matter before this Court was argued on the basis of the entitlement of this Court to interfere if persuaded that the conduct of the trial constituted a miscarriage of justice:  R v Demirok [1976] VR 244 at 251.
39The mother was examined in chief and cross-examined at some length about all these conversations.  She had some explanation for all potentially damaging aspects of the conversations.  That said, her explanations were, on their face, less than compelling.  It can be inferred that the jury thought this by its findings of guilt.
40As I have already said, the whole of the mother's evidence, and not merely the records of these conversations, was not admitted against the appellant.  No complaint was made about the joint trial, however, other than by reference to the evidence of the taped conversations.
41The case against both the mother and the appellant was fundamentally the recorded testimony of the complainant.  An examination of the evidence of the appellant given at the first trial and tendered against him at the second trial reveals a body of evidence that is far from impressive.  One example will suffice.  He admitted dropping in at the house at Tilbuster, but only to deliver basic supplies of cigarettes, milk, biscuits, etc.  He said he stayed 20 minutes.  Though in a sexual relationship with the mother at this time, he said he did not stay and have sex with her, because 20-30 minutes was not long enough even to have a ""quickie"".  A perusal of his answers in cross-examination reveals a less than impressive transcript.  This evidence conflicted with the mother's, but her evidence was not admissible against him at the second trial.  It conflicted profoundly with the complainant's, which was the basis of the conviction.
42The trial judge and the jury were faced with a difficult task, given how the trial had come about.  The starting point is to recognise that the trial judge gave the clearest possible directions, both in writing and orally, about the necessity to decide the appellant's case without the evidence of the mother and exhibits S, T, U, V and W (being the records of conversations).  No complaint was made about those directions.  The operation of the criminal law requires the assumption that, as a general rule, juries follow directions:  Gilbert v R [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414.
43When one considers the whole of the evidence, in particular the detailed evidence of the complainant and of each of the appellant and the mother, including the cross-examination of each, there is the basis for a more than comfortable conclusion that it was plainly open to convict both, restricting oneself to the evidence against each in conformity with the trial judge's direction.  There were significant parts of the evidence of both the mother and the appellant that are unimpressive.  I have already mentioned the evidence about not staying at Tilbuster for longer than 20 minutes.  The evidence the appellant gave about the four hour ride with the complainant was less than persuasive - that she was asleep for long periods and that he had a shower to remove heavy grease from his arm.  Though not logically flawed, the answers in their context inspire no confidence in veracity.
44The appellant argued that there was irretrievable and unavoidable prejudice.  I do not agree.  A misuse of the evidence against the mother was possible.  It should not be assumed that it occurred.  It has not been demonstrated to have occurred.
45I am not persuaded of any miscarriage of justice on this ground.
Ground 2:  The admission of the record of interview
46The Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 89, is in the following terms:
""(1)In a criminal proceeding, an inference unfavourable to a party must not be drawn from evidence that the party or another person failed or refused: 
(a)to answer one or more questions, or
(b)to respond to a representation,
put or made to the party or other person by an investigating official who at that time was performing functions in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of an offence.
(2)Evidence of that kind is not admissible if it can only be used to draw such an inference.
(3)Subsection (1) does not prevent use of the evidence to prove that the party or other person failed or refused to answer the question or to respond to the representation if the failure or refusal is a fact in issue in the proceeding.
(4)In this section: 
inference includes: 
(a)an inference of consciousness of guilt, or
(b)an inference relevant to a party's credibility.""
47An electronically recorded interview of the appellant was played in evidence.  There were a large number of questions to which the answer ""no comment"" was given by the appellant.
48Black DCJ had declined to exclude this evidence of ""no comment"".  He did so in a short ex tempore judgment of 2 September 2008.
49It was put on the appeal that in some fashion the parties had agreed to be bound by this ruling.  However, an examination of the transcript before Woods DCJ indicates that there was no objection to the tender of the record of interview.  It was admitted without objection.  The matter should, however, be approached on the basis of both the admissibility of the totality of the record and any prejudice to the appellant.
50The matter is to be approached first by the recognition that the trial judge gave clear directions to the jury that the appellant was entitled to say nothing to the police and that nothing could be inferred from any refusal to comment.  
51Much of the debate that took place before this Court was as to the legitimacy of the proposition that the whole of the record of interview was admissible in order to show the fairness of the police procedure.  This approach has its genesis in decisions such as R v Reeves (1992) 29 NSWLR 109 and R v Plevac (1995) 84 A Crim R 570.  It should be noted that in this case the last few questions and answers reveal that the appellant did not unequivocally accept that the questioning had been fair.  It could be accepted that whilst there had been no allegation in the first trial of unfairness in treatment by the appellant that matter could not necessarily be excluded.
52It should be noted that in fact counsel for the appellant at the trial sought to obtain advantage from the conduct of the record of interview.  In addressing the defence case it was said that the appellant attended the police station not appreciating what the allegations were, in that they involved the complainant and not her mother.  Counsel then addressed on the basis that once the interview got to a certain point and the allegations became ""gross and disgusting"" he broke down and this plainly indicated his innocence.
53Now is not the occasion to review comprehensively the relationship between pre-Evidence Act authorities such as Reeves and Plevac and the operation of s 89.  Given the lack of unequivocal acceptance in the record of interview of the fairness of the questions, the lack of objection to the evidence and, more importantly, the actual utility sought to be obtained by defence counsel from the content of the record of interview, I do not think there is any ground to complain about the admission of the totality of the record.
54In all the circumstances, I do not think, in the light of the clearest of directions by the trial judge, that there was any miscarriage.  Further, on the authority of Reeves and Plevac this is a basis to conclude that there was a purpose in the evidence other than an impermissible purpose of inference from silence.
55The above said, the provisions of s 89 are a statutory recognition of a fundamental right.  It should not be relegated to irrelevance by tenders to avoid a challenge to fairness of procedures which are not real.  Here, there were matters within the record which were facts in issue, such as where he had worked and that he had known the mother and the like.  Editing of the transcript would have been straightforward.  I do not, however, think there has either been error demonstrated or any likely injustice in the light of the clearest of directions to the jury.
Accumulation of grounds 1 and 2
56During argument there arose the question as to whether the appellant faced a particular difficulty by reason of the accumulative effects of the record of interview being admitted and also the records of the conversations between the complainant and the mother.
57When one considers the totality of the evidence, including in particular the evidence of the complainant, the appellant and the mother, and the cross-examination of all three, and when one considers the clarity of the trial judge's directions, I do not think that there was any risk of additional prejudice by any form of accumulation.
Ground 3 - medical examination
58The evidence of a Dr Guard was admitted.  That evidence was directed to the condition of the complainant's hymen upon examination in November 2005.  Two deficiencies were found, indicating that at some point in the past there had been a laceration that split the hymen leaving a scar or gap.  Dr Guard could not say when it happened, only that something had penetrated to the edge of the hymen to cause it.  She could not say what force or use occasioned it.  She said that one penetration could have caused the injury.  The injury was consistent with the allegation that the complainant's vagina was penetrated by fingers, the vibrator or a penis.
59The complaint was made that the evidence was prejudicial and irrelevant.  The decision of R v Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 74 at [297]-[298] was called in aid.
60First of all, there was no objection at the trial to the evidence.  Leave is required to raise the point.  In my view leave should not be granted and if leave were granted this ground of appeal should be dismissed.  The trial judge directed the jury in this respect in a way that demonstrates why those two results should flow in relation to this ground.  The trial judge said the following:
""You will recall that Dr Guard gave evidence that there was some tearing of the hymen at two points and she indicated that this was consistent with at least one exercise of something having been inserted into the vagina.  But her evidence is a year after the event and it is a matter for you to determine what you make of that.  That evidence is put forward not as direct evidence linking Mr Ross with the tearing of the hymen, it is merely put forward to indicate that it is at least consistent.
On this point of consistency I should say this to you.  The mere fact that something is consistent with something else does not mean it was true.  If there is a murder investigation and the police find some blood on the ground, blood group B.  It may turn out that you have blood group B, but that does not mean you are guilty of murder.  Consistent is a term which simply means that the evidence does not exclude the person and is not to be taken any higher than that.  One then looks to other evidence.
...
So, in this case, the Crown asserts it is consistent with the evidence of Dr Guard that what the accused Ross is said to have done could have occurred.  Now, that is logically correct, but it could physically be done by anybody at all, that it is to say, there is nothing in the injury itself which pointed to this particular accused as distinct from me or anybody at the bar table or any of you.  Consistency means that a certain conclusion is logically possible, but not necessary.""
61The evidence was not irrelevant.  If no evidence were led about the matter it may have been a matter to which the jury would turn its mind.  Without any evidence the jury may be led to speculate about the physical condition of the complainant.  There is no basis to think that with the direction given by the trial judge there could be any prejudice.  In the light of these matters, and in the light of the fact that no objection was taken, this ground fails.
Ground 4 - inconsistent verdicts
62The appellant submitted that the fact that he was found not guilty on two charges indicates that there were inconsistent verdicts and for that reason the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory.  The submission was that it was difficult to see how it was open to the jury to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt in respect of all the other matters when the appellant was acquitted of counts 15 and 18:  cf Jones v R [1997] HCA 56; 191 CLR 439.
63The appellant also pointed out that count 18 was the only count that did not in some fashion involve the mother.  This, it was said, placed heightened focus upon the evidence against the mother (otherwise inadmissible against him).  The answer to both aspects of this complaint is to be found in an understanding of the evidence by reference to well known authority.
64There is no general rule that where several charges all depend upon the evidence of one complainant, acquittal on one demands acquittal on all.  The assessment of the evidence of a witness is more sophisticated than that:  see DD v R [2010] NSWCCA 237 at [26]; Dungay v R [2010] NSWCCA 82; MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606.
65The acquittals on counts 15 and 18 do not necessarily signify any doubt about the fundamental veracity and acceptability of the evidence of the complainant.  The jury, properly instructed, was to exercise caution in assessing all the evidence of the complainant.  Although there was no corroboration of the complainant's account of the conduct alleged in each count, she had not initially spoken of the whole of the conduct that was reflected in count 15 and had not mentioned count 18 at all during her first interview.  A direction in accordance with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 was given to the jury to scrutinise the complainant's evidence with care.  As the Chief Judge at Common Law observed in TK v R [2009] NSWCCA 151; 74 NSWLR 299 at [7], ""[i]t may be that, having been reminded of the problems of uncorroborated evidence by the trial judge, before a jury convicts on any count where the primary evidence is of the complainant, it will seek out matters in the surrounding evidence which are consistent with the complainant's account.""
66The reference to the knife was less than compelling in the interview.  It appears that the only reference to it was made concerning the alleged events amounting to count 15.  Yet at the trial, when asked by the Crown Prosecutor if the appellant used the knife on her at any time, she replied ""[h]e always had the knife; he just didn't use it"".  When cross-examined by counsel for the appellant about references to the knife, there were answers of an indefinite character about what she had said about the knife to others.  There was also difficulty in description of the knife.  Both counsel for the accused addressed the jury strongly in relation to the answers about the knife.  A doubt about the presence of the knife had the potential to affect the jury's assessment of count 15 and also about count 18 which occurred the following morning.  If there was a doubt about threats with a dangerous weapon the evening before, there may have been a doubt about the events of the following morning.  Further, the complainant had not spoken of the events the subject of count 18 at all in her initial interview with police on 24 October 2005.
67Thus, there are sound possible reasons for the explanation of the jury's approach to counts 15 and 18 that reflect the cautious approach by a jury carefully and precisely instructed by the trial judge.  
Result of the appeal
68For the above reasons none of the grounds are made out.  Leave is required because an extension of time was required for the filing of the notice of appeal.  No objection was made to that beyond the substance of the opposition to the appeal.  In my view the orders of the Court ought to be:
1.Time be extended for the filing of a notice of appeal to the date of the filing of the notice of appeal herein.
2.Appeal against conviction dismissed.
69HIDDEN J: I agree with the orders proposed by the President and with his Honour's reasons.  As to ground 2, it may well be that the Reeves line of authority will need to be reconsidered in an appropriate case, but I agree with the President that this is not that case.
70DAVIES J:  I agree with Allsop P.

2418115,Blackwell v R [2012] NSWCCA 227,"Judgment
1McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Garling J.
2McCALLUM J: I agree with Garling J.  
3GARLING J: This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in respect of a sentence imposed by the District Court of New South Wales (Cogswell DCJ) on 13 February 2012.
4The respondent, Mr Blackwell, had been convicted by Cogswell DCJ after a trial without a jury, of an offence of reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.
5The offence related to the fact that on 13 October 2007, at a hotel in Sydney, Mr Blackwell had assaulted a victim, whilst holding a glass, and seriously injured the victim.  
6The maximum penalty for the offence was 10 years imprisonment.  A standard non-parole period was fixed for the offence of 4 years.
7The sentencing Judge imposed an overall sentence of 4 years and 4 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months to date from 3 August 2009.  
Procedural history8The proceedings against Mr Blackwell have had a somewhat protracted procedural history.  It is appropriate to recount this history.
9Mr Blackwell was arrested and charged on the day of the assault, 13 October 2007.  Bail was refused.  On 23 October 2007, he was granted bail subject to various conditions which, from time to time, were varied.  He complied with those conditions.
10On 8 December 2008, Mr Blackwell was arraigned in the District Court before Hock DCJ and a jury of 12.  On 18 December 2008, Mr Blackwell was found guilty by the jury of an offence, contrary to the provisions of s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act, of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intention to cause grievous bodily harm.  The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years.
11On 24 April 2009, Hock DCJ sentenced Mr Blackwell to imprisonment for a total term of 9 years, dating from 8 December 2008, with a non-parole period of 6 years.  The non-parole period would have expired on 7 December 2014.  
12Mr Blackwell appealed against his conviction and also sought leave to appeal against his sentence.  On 23 August 2010, the Court of Criminal Appeal (Beazley JA, James and Hall JJ) heard his appeal.  For the reasons that they published on 15 April 2011, the Court, by majority, allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and ordered that there be a new trial: Blackwell v R [2011] NSWCCA 93.  
13On 10 May 2011, the Supreme Court granted bail, and on 4 June 2011, Mr Blackwell entered into conditional bail.
14Mr Blackwell stood trial for a second time before Cogswell DCJ sitting without a jury starting 31 October 2011.  Conditional bail continued throughout the trial.  
15Immediately prior to being arraigned, on a count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm, counsel for Mr Blackwell indicated to the Court that he pleaded not guilty to that count but guilty of the statutory alternative to that count, namely, that he had recklessly inflicted grievous bodily harm on the victim, which is, an offence contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act.  
16This plea of guilty was not accepted by the Crown in satisfaction of the indictment, and the trial proceeded, on the more serious offence set out in the indictment.
17On 8 November 2011, Cogswell DCJ delivered his reasons and found that Mr Blackwell was not guilty of the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent so to do. However, he found him guilty of the statutory alternative offence of reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm.  Conditional bail continued from 8 November 2011 until 3 February 2012, during sentencing proceedings when bail was not applied for and refused.
18On 13 February 2012, Cogswell DCJ sentenced Mr Blackwell to a total term of 4 years and 4 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months.  Cogswell DCJ took into account all of the time which Mr Blackwell had, prior to the sentence, been held in custody and determined that the appropriate commencement date for the offence would be 3 August 2009.  Consequently, the non-parole period to which Mr Blackwell was sentenced by Cogswell DCJ expired on 2 April 2012, and the balance of the term will expire on 2 December 2013.
19Mr Blackwell remained in continuous custody until he was released on parole on 16 May 2012, and has since then been in the community, but subject to such supervision as the Probation and Parole Service have undertaken.
The facts20The offence was committed by Mr Blackwell in the early hours of 13 October 2007, at Scruffy Murphy's Hotel in Sydney.
21Mr Blackwell was at the hotel and had been so for some time.  He was alone and he was drunk.  
22The victim, Mr Daniel Ward, who was a police officer but who was off duty at the time, attended at Scruffy Murphy's Hotel, arriving there at about midnight or so.  Prior to that time, Mr Ward had been at a bar in Darling Harbour with some of his colleagues, farewelling a fellow police officer.  By the time Mr Ward arrived at Scruff Murphy's Hotel, he was affected by alcohol to a moderate extent.  
23At or about 3.20am, Mr Ward and a number of his female colleagues were on the dance floor in the hotel.  Mr Blackwell approached the group, attempting to try and dance with them.  He was told that he was not welcome by the group, but he persisted.  His approach was rebuffed by the female members of the group.
24He again persisted and Mr Ward stepped in, telling Mr Blackwell to leave.  Mr Blackwell, who was holding a glass in his hand, struck out and hit Mr Ward in the face.  
25As a consequence of that blow, Mr Ward was severely injured and has now lost the sight of one eye.  He has facial scarring and has undergone surgery.  His career in the police force is severely limited and he suffers from psychological damage with an adverse affect on his confidence, particularly when mixing socially.  His social and recreational activities are restricted because he has only one eye.
26Mr Blackwell was arrested at the scene after being detained by security staff of the hotel.  He was taken to the police station where, after being given some time to recover from his intoxication, he was charged with the present offence.  
27At the trial before Cogswell DCJ, the trial Judge found that he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time Mr Blackwell struck Mr Ward, he had the requisite intention to cause grievous bodily harm.  His Honour made that finding because he found that Mr Blackwell was behaving like a person who was very drunk and who was not adequately processing information about what was going on.  His Honour said that the period of time involved in the assault was so short that he could not be satisfied that Mr Blackwell had the requisite intention.
Crown's submissions on sentence28Mr Blackwell gave evidence at the trial before Cogswell DCJ, but did not give evidence again on the sentence hearing.  
29The Crown tendered a Pre-Sentence Report, the applicant's criminal history and a Victim Impact Statement.
30The criminal history record contained some relatively minor offences in the applicant's past.  
31The Victim Impact Statement recorded, in some detail, the significant adverse effect which the assault had upon Mr Ward.  
32The Pre-Sentence Report recorded that some years previously, at the age of 23, by reason of being involved in a motorcycle accident in which Mr Blackwell was injured and a close friend travelling as his pillion passenger was killed, he suffered post-traumatic stress disorder with accompanying depression, for which he had been treated with a two week in-patient session in Perth.  Since then he had taken medication, but by the time of the pre-sentence report, having engaged in regular counselling sessions with a psychologist, he was not on medication any longer.  
33It recorded that although he had been a heavy drinker in the past his consumption of alcohol was moderated by the time of the report.  It recorded that he did not regularly drink nor was his drinking problematic.
34The report recorded that he expressed his regret and remorse for the offence.  He said he accepted responsibility for what occurred.
35The Crown, in oral submissions, drew the attention of the sentencing Judge to the following:
(a)the fact that the injury to Mr Ward was a substantial one;
(b)that the plea entered by Mr Blackwell was entered late and deserved a discount which ""...should be less than 20%, [and] should be in the realms of perhaps 10%"";
(c)that the circumstances called for a full-time custodial sentence which would need to exceed the period of time that Mr Blackwell had already served by way of a non-parole period; and
(d)the Crown accepted that there were special circumstances.
36The Crown provided the sentencing Judge with a series of statistics from the relevant database, and conceded that it would be appropriate to date the commencement of any further term of imprisonment to a date two and a half years before the sentence was imposed, to take account of the two periods of custody which Mr Blackwell had served.
Mr Blackwell's submissions on sentence37In support of the submissions, a number of documents were tendered for Mr Blackwell.  
38The first was a report by Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist, dated 1 February 2012.  Dr Nielssen expressed this opinion:
""The diagnosis of depressive illness is made on the basis of Mr Blackwell's account of previously having the syndrome of depression, including frequent thoughts of suicide, and the supporting information from the medical reports.  His condition responded to treatment with anti-depressant medication and counselling.  The disorder was described as being in remission, on the basis of Mr Blackwell's presentation during the recent interview, when he did not appear to be pervasively depressed, and the history that his treating psychiatrist had not advised him to take antidepressant medication.
The diagnosis of alcohol abuse disorder is made on the basis of the history of a pattern of very hazardous drinking, especially around the time of this offence, and the complications of alcohol abuse, including the episode of alcohol-related amnesia and the criminal charge.
...
Mr Blackwell expressed his sorrow and remorse over his actions.  He reported being very wary of the effects of alcohol and to have a completely different attitude to the use of alcohol.
He was assessed to have good prospects for rehabilitation on the basis of his skills, prospects for employment and the support he enjoys from his family.""
39As well, a report from Mr Tony Olech, a clinical psychologist, was tendered.  The report was dated 31 March 2009, and summarised the ten consultations which Mr Olech had with Mr Blackwell.
40In broad terms, the report recorded the progress that Mr Blackwell had made with respect to his psychological and psychiatric states.  It concluded with this summary with respect to the likelihood of future commission of crime:
""A direct assessment of the likelihood of recidivism was not part of my therapy with Mr Blackwell ... Nevertheless, Mr Blackwell's willingness to engage in therapy and seek help for himself, indications that he was starting to make gains in therapy, his shock and feeling appalled at the possibility of committing such a crime, as well as his empathy for the victim are good indicators of a reduced risk of committing such a crime in the future.  Re-engagement in his occupation as an off-shore diver, which he clearly enjoys, and a minimisation of alcohol use and abstinence from illicit substance use will also further reduce the risk.""
41I note that after Mr Blackwell's release, following upon the successful appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, he did re-engage with his employment as an offshore diver, and in all other respects seemed to have resumed his life.  He did not commit any further offences.
42Other documents were tendered supporting the existence of a post-traumatic disorder following upon the motor accident.  As well, letters from Mr Blackwell's general practitioner, his parents and various friends, all assisted to identify a picture of Mr Blackwell which suggested that he would have a stable life upon release from custody, he would have family support and that, notwithstanding the particular offence, he had good prospects of rehabilitation.
43In oral and written submissions, the following matters were put on behalf of Mr Blackwell:
(a)the plea of guilty merited a discount of 20 per cent on any sentence; 
(b)Mr Blackwell had no significant record of any previous convictions; 
(c)he was essentially a person of good character having regard to his limited prior criminal convictions, his work record and the references attesting to his good character;
(d)he was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation;
(e)he had demonstrated remorse.
44The submissions accepted that the offence had caused substantial injury and emotional harm.  
45The submissions also accepted that a term of imprisonment was appropriate, but he submitted that, in light of all the circumstances, no further time was required to be served in custody. 
Remarks on Sentence46The sentencing Judge recorded the following matters:
(a)the fact of, and the contents of, the Victim Impact Statement.  His Honour concluded that the injury was a very serious one and it had had a very significant personal impact on the victim;
(b)that he regarded Mr Blackwell's previous record as being of little significance;
(c)he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, for the reasons which he had given in his judgment on Mr Blackwell's guilt, that Mr Blackwell knew that he had a glass in his hand when he punched the victim, Mr Ward;
(d)Mr Blackwell was a highly regarded young man, with a lot of potential, who worked very hard;
(e)he accepted that Mr Blackwell's prospects of rehabilitation were good, if not very good.  His Honour concluded that Mr Blackwell was unlikely to re-offend;
(f)his Honour found that it was appropriate to allow a discount with respect to the plea of guilty of 13 per cent.
47His Honour noted the statistics which had been provided to him, and in particular drew attention to the decision of Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1, which he found to be of some assistance.
48Ultimately, his Honour expressed his conclusion in this way:
""The maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment for this crime and I regard this as a serious example of this sort of crime, where the grievous bodily harm is grave and has had obviously a significant impact on the victim and his life.  Without the features such as Mr Blackwell's remorse and his prospects of rehabilitation and the unlikelihood of him offending again and the fact that he has very few prior convictions, I would have thought that a sentence of 6 years imprisonment would be appropriate.  But after those considerations I would regard a sentence of 5 years as being the appropriate one to impose in this case.  I will reduce that figure by 13 per cent to reflect Mr Blackwell's plea of guilty.""
49By reason of his finding of special circumstances, his Honour applied a ratio of about 65 per cent between the non-parole and parole period (though the ratio was referred to as 66 per cent), rather than the 75 per cent ratio mandated by the legislation.  This finding of special circumstances, and the resulting ratio, is not challenged by the Crown.  
Grounds of appeal50The Crown relied upon seven grounds of appeal, which were as follows;
""Ground 1: His Honour denied the Crown procedural fairness in his finding that the matter did not involve the actual use of a weapon, pursuant to s 21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentence Proceedings) Act as the respondent did not know he had a glass in his hand at the time.
Ground 2: His Honour was in error in finding that the respondent did not know he had a glass in his hand when he was punching the victim.
Ground 3: His Honour erred in failing to have regard to the use of a glass as a weapon as an aggravating feature under s 21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentence Proceedings) Act.
Ground 4: His Honour erred by failing to have regard to the higher moral culpability of an offence under section 35(2) as amended by the Crimes Amendment Act 2007 since R v Blackwell [2011] NSWCCA 93.
Ground 5: His Honour was in error in giving a discrete mathematical discount (17%) to remorse, rehabilitation, and unlikelihood to offend, and that such an approach also involved double counting.
Ground 6: It was an error to give the respondent a discount of 13% for the utilitarian value of the plea.
Ground 7: The sentence is manifestly inadequate.""
51It is convenient to deal with the first three Grounds together, because they are closely linked.
Grounds 1, 2 and 3 - Knowledge of and use of a glass52As I have recorded above, his Honour found in the course of his Sentencing Remarks, that he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Blackwell knew that he had a glass in his hand when he was punching the victim, Mr Ward.  He remarked that he came to that conclusion for the reasons that he had given in his judgment at trial.  This was clearly a reference to the reasons which his Honour gave for concluding that he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Blackwell had any intention to cause grievous bodily harm.  Clearly, if Mr Blackwell knew he had a glass in his hand and intended to strike the victim's face with it, then the requisite intention for that offence against s 33(1) of the Crimes Act would have been established.  His Honour was not so satisfied.
53In his judgment, Cogswell DCJ reviewed at length the evidence which told in favour of Mr Blackwell having the intent necessary for the offence against s 33(1) of the Crimes Act.  He also reviewed the evidence telling against this inference.  In so doing, he noted, highlighted and discussed the submissions made by the Crown Prosecutor and the senior counsel for the defendant.  There is no doubt that in advancing their respective submissions, the Crown Prosecutor and senior counsel for the applicant, had a sufficient opportunity to be heard.  They each exhausted their arguments.
54In the circumstances of this case, a finding that Mr Blackwell, by throwing a punch, or else his fist, at the head of the victim, whilst there was a glass in his hand, did not intend to inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Ward, necessarily incorporates the question of whether he knew, and adverted to, the fact that there was a glass in his hand and that it would, if it came into contact with Mr Ward's face, as it did, cause grievous bodily harm.  
55However, the Crown submits, in support of the first ground, that it was denied procedural fairness in the finding made by his Honour in his Remarks on Sentence, to the effect that Mr Blackwell knew that he had the glass in his hand, because it did not have any notice that such a finding was to be made, and hence had no opportunity to make any submissions to the Court about it.  
56The basis of this submission was that in the written submissions by Mr Blackwell's counsel, he had conceded that ""the offending involved the use of a glass..."" which, together with circumstances, the subject of the submissions, constituted an aggravating feature in accordance with s 21A(2)(b) and (c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
57The Crown submits that that submission was not qualified in any way, and accordingly, since the Crown accepted that characterisation involving an aggravating feature, there was no need for the Crown to address upon it.  
58The Crown put its submission on the denial of procedural fairness in this way:
""At no stage did his Honour give the Crown the benefit in the hearing of indicating that he intended to reject the respondent's acceptance that this aggravating feature should be found.  His Honour had a duty of procedural fairness to the Crown to inform the Crown, in all of the circumstances ..., that he was thinking of rejecting the respondent's acceptance of the aggravating feature.""
59I am not persuaded that the Crown was denied procedural fairness in the circumstances of this case.  There are three principal reasons why this is so.  First, as I have said above, the Crown had ample opportunity during the course of the trial to address the Court on whether it had proved the more serious offence against s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act.  A central part of these submissions dealt with the question of whether Mr Blackwell intended to cause Mr Ward grievous bodily harm.  These submissions necessarily included the question of whether M Blackwell knew and appreciated that he had a glass in his hand when he threw a punch at Mr Ward.  His Honour rejected these submissions and gave ample reasons for so doing.
60Secondly, the written submissions of Mr Blackwell on sentence, which are said by the Crown to contain a concession that Mr Blackwell knew that he had a glass in his hand, do not bear out the construction for which the Crown contends.  Senior counsel for Mr Blackwell did not refer specifically to that part of his written submissions, during his oral submissions, which preceded those of the Crown.  However, on two occasions during those submissions, he did remind Cogswell DCJ that the offence was unintended on his client's part.
61Looking then at the written submissions, it is to be observed that generally speaking, the submissions draw attention to evidence and put argument about relevance by reference to the provisions of ss 21A(2) and 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Relevantly, the submissions read:
""S21A(2)(b) and (c) - Violence and Weapon
59. The offending involved the use of a glass but occurred in circumstances where:
(i) ...
(vii) The action was a reflex/spur of the moment spontaneous reaction/action.""
62The sections to which reference is made require a court to take into account as aggravating factors, whether the offence involved the actual and threatened use of violence or a weapon.  Contrary to the Crown's submission, whilst there was a reference to the fact that the use of a glass was involved in the offending, the submissions make no reference to, nor any mention of, Mr Blackwell's knowledge about the glass.  No concession can be found in the respondent's submissions. 
63Thirdly, a finding of the kind which the Crown contends was expressly conceded, would have been contrary to the findings and reasoning involved in the sentencing judge's judgment on the question of whether the more serious offence of intending to cause harm had been made out.  On sentence, the judge was obliged to sentencing Mr Blackwell on a version of the facts which was consistent with his first judgment.
64I would not uphold Ground 1.  
65The second ground relied upon by the Crown with respect to the use of the glass, is one of discrete error, namely, that the sentencing judge erred in finding that Mr Blackwell did not remember that he had a glass in his hand when he punched Mr Ward.
66Whether such a finding was available on the evidence depends upon the drawing of an inference contrary to that for which Mr Blackwell contended, because Mr Blackwell had no recollection of the conduct at all.  This is unsurprising because of the fact that he was well intoxicated.
67In addition to the witnesses, there was also available a CCTV record of the incident.  That record is, it must be said, of very little assistance.  It is indistinct.  I found no real assistance from the viewing of the CCTV footage in attempting to access the state of mind of the applicant.
68There was sufficient evidence available to the sentencing judge for him to conclude that at the time Mr Blackwell threw the punch, which caused the injury, he was not aware that he was holding the glass.  That evidence includes the nature of the punch itself, which was described by witnesses as, in effect, a spontaneous action or reaction; the fact that the glass was not first smashed and then shoved, with the broken edges leading, into the victim's face, rather than as the applicant described it in his evidence that as he was moving or falling backwards, his arm went forwards towards Mr Ward; the fact of, and the extent of, Mr Blackwell's intoxication, which the Crown Prosecutor accepted, in submissions to the Court, did not assist the prosecution case on intent, and the fact that the punch was not preceded by obvious aggression between Mr Blackwell and Mr Ward.
69In my opinion, having regard to this evidence, it cannot be said that his Honour fell into error in including the finding that he did.  I would not uphold Ground 2.
70Ground 3 claims that the sentencing judge erred in failing to have regard to the use of the glass in Mr Blackwell's hand as constituting the use of a weapon which is an aggravating feature in accordance with s 21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act.  This ground encompasses the same factual basis as the previous two grounds.  If the sentencing judge had found, as on the Crown submissions he ought to have, that Mr Blackwell knew that he had the glass in his hand when he struck out and punched Mr Ward, then it was arguable that his conduct was aggravated by the use of a weapon.  In light of the fact that I am not persuaded of any error in the sentencing judge's finding that Mr Blackwell did not know that the glass was in his hand when he punched Mr Ward, I am not persuaded that there was any error in failing to find the use of a weapon.  I would not uphold Ground 3.
Ground 4 - Higher moral culpability71The Crown argues that as a consequence of the decision of this Court in the first appeal involving Mr Blackwell: Blackwell v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 93, that an offence against s 35(2) of the Crimes Act carries a higher degree of moral culpability than it was originally regarded as so doing.  
72The Crown points to [82] in the judgment of Beazley JA, with whom on this point, James and Hall JJ agreed.  Her Honour said:
""Relevantly for present purposes, the statute provides for an offence of ""recklessly [causing] grievous bodily harm"".  There is no definitional construct within the terms of the provision which governs its meaning.  There is a requirement of recklessness, which I have addressed.  That is, there must be a foresight of the possibility of something.  The recklessness must cause something.  That which it must cause is grievous bodily harm.  In my opinion, there is no basis upon which that term can be read down to mean ""some physical injury"".  Although the purpose of the amending legislation was to remove the 'archaic' fault element of offences done maliciously, there is a difference of substance between an intention to inflict some physical harm (the former section 35) and recklessness as to whether grievous bodily harm would be inflicted (section 35(2) as amended) as I have explained.""
73The Crown submits that since the decision of this Court in Blackwell, it is essential that the offender have a level of realisation of the fact that the injury that they may inflict is one involving grievous bodily harm and proceed with the act anyway.  The submission follows that there is a higher level of moral culpability involved in such conduct which must, of necessity, be reflected in the sentence to be imposed.
74It is then submitted that the sentencing Judge did not consider the consequences of the verdict in the light of this Court's decision in Mr Blackwell's earlier appeal.
75It is first necessary to observe that the prosecutor, when making submissions to the sentencing Judge, did not refer to this argument.  He did not submit that the Judge ought form the view that there was a higher degree of moral culpability necessitated by the findings of this Court in the first appeal.  The prosecutor made no reference at all to the question of the nature of the offence or the degree of moral culpability involved.  The prosecutor's submissions touched upon, as I have adverted to earlier, the significance of the injury involved, matters subjective to Mr Blackwell, the extent of the discount for the plea of guilty, and the likelihood of successful rehabilitation and abstinence from alcohol.
76The prosecutor also addressed the objective seriousness of the offence by submitting ""it is above the middle range of criminality ... when your Honour takes into account all the circumstances"".  
77It is difficult to see, from a reading of the Remarks on Sentence, how the present ground and the Crown's submission relates to any error in the sentencing Judge's Remarks.  Since the matter was not addressed in submissions to him, there is no direct reference to it by his Honour in his Remarks.
78However, it is clear that his Honour was seized of the seriousness of the offence.  He identified the maximum penalty, and that the offence carried a standard non-parole period.  In so doing, his Honour said:
""... Parliament has fixed a maximum sentenced of 10 years imprisonment to that crime.  Not only that, Parliament regards the crime as so serious that it has fixed a standard non-parole period of 4 years imprisonment to the crime.""
Later in his judgment, the sentencing Judge said this:
""The maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment for this crime and I regard this as a serious example of this sort of crime, where the grievous bodily harm is grave and has obviously a significant impact on the victim and his life.""
79I see no basis for a submission that, in some way incapable of being specifically identified, the sentencing Judge has failed to have regard to the appropriate level of moral culpability involved in an offence such as this.
80I would reject Ground 4.
Grounds 5 and 6 - Errors in discounts81In Ground 5 the Crown complains that the sentencing Judge was ""in error in giving a discrete mathematical discount (17%) to remorse, rehabilitation and unlikelihood to offend ..."".  This submission refers to that part of the judgment which I have extracted at [48] above where his Honour, in determining an appropriate sentence, refers to the fact that had these subjective features not been present, a longer sentence would have been appropriate.
82I observe that his Honour did not specifically identify or calculate a 17 per cent discount in the manner in which this ground of appeal implies.  This is a calculation made by the Crown.  The reasoning to which the Crown points was part of the Judge's reasoning, which explained how he reached his conclusion that, having regard to all of the facts and circumstances, including both the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective factors to which he was obliged to have regard, a sentence of 5 years imprisonment, before any discount for a plea of guilty, was the appropriate one.
83However, the Crown submits that this reasoning was in breach of this Court's approach in R v MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159, because it has, in effect, provided a double discount for the same features which were associated with the plea of guilty.
84The Crown points to [44] and [45] of that decision.  
85However, particularly relevant in this case, is what the Court said in [41] and [42].  The Court said:
""41 In any event it seems to us that events have moved on somewhat since Thomson and Houlton was decided. In particular, s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act has been enacted and requires the sentencing court to take into account specifically, as matters in mitigation of sentence, not only the plea of guilty but also that the offender is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation. In respect of the last two matters it is clear that remorse will be a major factor in determining whether those matters of mitigation exist: without true remorse it is difficult to see how either finding could be made. Although it is accepted that nothing in s 21A affects, or was intended to affect, the matters that were taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence before the section was enacted, the section does highlight the fact that there is an overlap between various sentencing considerations and has led this Court to be more sensitive to the fact of, or at least the appearance of, double counting either in favour of, or to the detriment of, the offender; see for example Elyard v R [2006] NSWCCA 43. 
42. Rarely, if ever, at the present time does a sentencing court give a rolled up discount for all aspects of the plea of guilty. Yet this was a practice recognised by the Court when Thomson and Houlton was decided; see at [162]. In this Court's experience the usual practice now is to specify a discount only for the utilitarian value of the plea and then to take remorse into account as it is reflected in the mitigating factors to which reference is made in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and other considerations such as the absence of any need for specific deterrence. If remorse does not give rise to any of those findings in mitigation of sentence, it is difficult to see its relevance, let alone why the sentence should be discounted in recognition of it.""
86In this case, I see no reason to think that his Honour was not conscious of the correct approach as articulated in MAK, nor that he allowed any additional discount for the plea of guilty over and above the utilitarian value of that plea.  As the Court says, in MAK, the existence of true remorse is typically a pre-condition to a finding of the existence of good prospects of rehabilitation and an unlikelihood of re-offending.
87I would not uphold this ground of appeal.
88Ground 6 complains that it was an error to give the respondent a discount of 13 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty.  
89The Crown submits that a discount of 13 per cent for the plea of guilty was not reasonably open to the sentencing Judge.  In support of this submission the Crown points to the following factors:
(a)no actual plea of guilty was ever entered, although the Crown accepts that an offer to plead guilty to the offence under s 35(2) of the Crimes Act, of which Mr Blackwell was ultimately convicted, was offered;
(b)the offer to plead guilty to the defence came on the eve of the second trial, 4 years after the offence;
(c)two trials and an appeal were conducted in the matter; and
(d)in the first trial the respondent had denied he was even the person involved in the attack.
90I would reject the Crown's submissions in the circumstances of this case.  The discount of 13 per cent was within the reasonable discretion of the trial Judge.  It is to be recalled that the Crown Prosecutor who appeared on the sentencing hearing, submitted that the discount should be less than 20 per cent and ""... should be in the realms of, perhaps, 10 per cent"".
91There is no appreciable difference between the discount his Honour applied and the submission which the Crown Prosecutor made at the sentence hearing.
92But, importantly, each of the matters to which the Crown refers, and which I have set out, do not call for the conclusion that the trial Judge's determination of the discount was erroneous.  
93In point (a) the Crown seeks to distinguish between the entry of an actual plea of guilty and the offer of a plea of guilty.  What in fact occurred on the first day of the trial before Cogswell DCJ is this: at the start of the trial and before Mr Blackwell was formally arraigned, the prosecutor raised a number of ""housekeeping"" matters with the trial Judge.  There was a general discussion of a number of matters which might affect the days upon which the Court should sit.  When that discussion was concluded, senior counsel for Mr Blackwell said this:
""Dunn: Your Honour, can I indicate one other matter of housekeeping, I will also indicate to my learned friend, I have instructions from my client to plead guilty to the reckless wounding charge under s 35(2).  I have indicated that to the Crown and I indicate it to the Court.  So that makes the only issue ...
His Honour: It does.  I guess I have to formally ask Mr Lungo does the Crown accept that offer so to speak?
Crown Prosecutor: No it doesn't.  
His Honour: But the indication is noted. 
Dunn: Thank your Honour.""
94Immediately thereafter Mr Blackwell was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the charge under s 33(2) of the Crimes Act.
95In the circumstances of this case, where the trial was being conducted before a judge sitting alone, I can discern no reason in principle why the method by which Mr Blackwell's counsel on his behalf, indicated his desire to plead guilty to the reckless wounding charge, which he, no doubt, knew the Crown would not accept in discharge of the indictment, should be a relevant factor to consider in the percentage discount applied by way of a reduction in the discount ordinarily to be applied.  It was obvious on the first day of this trial, at the commencement of it, for a trial that was listed for five to seven days, that Mr Blackwell was prepared to plead guilty to the charge of reckless wounding.  
96It is correct that the offer to plead guilty was late.  It came on the eve of, or at the start of, the second trial.  No doubt that is one of the reasons why the percentage discount is towards the lower end of the range regarded as appropriate: see R v Thompson; R v Houlten [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [151]-[155].
97The remaining two matters relied upon by the Crown, namely that there had been two trials and an appeal, and that at the first trial the respondent denied that he was the person involved in the attack, are not relevant, in the circumstances of this case, to the calculation of this discount, which related to the utilitarian value of the plea.  
98It is sufficiently clear that his Honour was allowing a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea.  It is not to be held against Mr Blackwell that his first trial resulted in a conviction which the Court of Criminal Appeal determined ought be set aside for error of law.  The relevant issue is the stage of the proceedings at which the plea was offered.  His Honour clearly had regard to this and gave it appropriate weight.
99I can detect no appellable error in the allocation by the sentencing judge of a discount of 13 per cent for the plea of guilty.
100This ground does not succeed.
Ground 7 - Manifest inadequacy101The Crown submits that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.  It submits that the offence, commonly known as ""glassing"", is an offence that is becoming prevalent, particularly in factual circumstances similar to those in the appeal.  It submits that it is an offence that calls for significant general deterrence, and that there was an inadequate sentence imposed in all of the circumstances.  
102The Crown draws attention to the remarks of Howie J in Sayin v R [2008] NSWCCA 307 at [47], where his Honour said:
""The Courts clearly must impose very severe penalties for such offenders, but of course within the limits afforded by the prescribed maximum penalty.  In light of the fact that the maximum penalty for an offence under s 35(2), recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm, is now 10 years imprisonment, the increased maximum penalty should result in a marked increase in the penalty for offences of this nature.""
103In addressing the seriousness of this particular offence, the Crown in its submissions pointed to the seriousness of the injury and the devastating career impact that the injury had on Mr Ward's future prospects in the NSW Police Service.  As well, it pointed to the fact that the offence was unprovoked, the victim was turning away from Mr Blackwell when the blow was delivered, the offence was unjustified and there was a significant degree of violence involved in the assault even though it consisted of a single blow.  As well, the Crown submitted that because the glass held in Mr Blackwell's hand had shattered at the time of the blow, there must have been considerable force used in the punch.
104In short, the Crown submitted:
""His Honour took into account the extent of the injuries to raise the seriousness of this offence, however his Honour should also have had regard to the aggravating factors of the use of the glass as a weapon, the degree of violence in the single blow and the unprovoked nature of the attack.""
105Three cases in particular are called to attention by the Crown in which the victim has lost the sight of an eye as a consequence of a glassing-type offence, where a breach of s 35(2) has been the relevant offence.  The Crown submitted that these cases demonstrated the manifest inadequacy of the sentence imposed.
106The first of these is the matter of Butters v R [2010] NSWCCA 1, where a total term of 4½ years was imposed with a non-parole period of 3 years.  Mr Butters also pleaded guilty at an early point in time and was given a 25 per cent reduction on his sentence as a consequence.  His Honour was specifically referred to this decision, and the detail of it, in addresses by counsel for Mr Blackwell.  The Crown Prosecutor agreed that it was a relevant decision.
107The second case is a matter of Reberger v R [2011] NSWCCA 132, where a stranger in the street was subjected to a glassing attack resulting in the loss of the sight of one eye.  The offender pleaded guilty at an early stage and an allowance of 25 per cent was made with respect to that plea.  On appeal, the sentence imposed was a total sentence of 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months.  
108The third of these cases is the decision of Spooner v R [2009] NSWCCA 247, where a total term of 4 years was imposed with a non-parole of 1 year and 10 months.  Mr Spooner also received a 25 per cent discount for an early plea of guilty.
109By reference only to the cases cited by the Crown, none of which are, of course, precisely the same as this matter, I would be prepared to conclude that this sentence was at the lower end of the appropriate range.  However, I am not at all positively satisfied that it was so low as to bespeak a failure of exercise of discretion on the part of the sentencing Judge.  
110The issue of whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate needs to be considered according to the particular facts of each case, the provisions of s 21 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the general principles of sentencing.  Given that an offence against s 35(2) of the Crimes Act is a ""result"" offence, and the injury here is a particularly serious one, even when in combination with all of the other relevant facts and circumstances, there is a sound basis for the Crown's submission that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.
111There is no need for me to form a concluded view on this question because even if I were persuaded that the sentence was manifestly inadequate, I would not, in the exercise of the residual discretion of this Court, have upheld this ground of appeal.
112The history, which has been related above, and which as a consequence has resulted in the applicant being at liberty at the time this appeal is being heard, and in circumstances where on two occasions the applicant had been in custody on separate discrete periods, does not justify this Court, in the exercise of its discretion, imposing a sentence that would have the effect of returning the applicant to custody.
113Since being released, Mr Blackwell has been living and working on a farm in southwestern New South Wales.  He has been subject to the supervision of the NSW Probation and Parole Service.  Shortly after his release on parole, Mr Blackwell sought permission to return to Tasmania and live there with his family, and to work on their farm.  This was not possible and, accordingly, he remains in New South Wales.
114There is no suggestion that Mr Blackwell has failed to comply with any of the requirements imposed on him by his parole.  There is no suggestion that he has not been of good behaviour.  According to the evidence tendered to the Court, his behaviour whilst on parole has demonstrated that the deterrent effect of his custody has, so far, succeeded.  None of the material suggests that there is any need for him to be returned to custody.
115In light of all of this material and the history to which I have referred, I would not be prepared to exercise my discretion to re-sentence the applicant.
116Accordingly, I would not uphold this ground of appeal.
Orders117I would propose that the Crown appeal ought be dismissed.**********

3The facts were agreed before the sentencing judge. They can be summarised in the following manner:
4The complainant (MC) was aged 14 years at the time of the offences. The applicant and her co-offender (her then boyfriend, now husband, Thomas Franklin) had been friends with the complainant's parents for a period of three years. They had met through the Air League, which is a youth organisation similar to the Royal Australian Air force cadets but concerned with civil aviation. At the time of the offences in September 2009 the co-offender was a senior member of the Air League. The complainant's father was the second in command. Both the applicant and the co-offender were involved in the instruction of children within the Air League. The complainant was a member of the Air League.
5The complainant went to the home of the applicant and her co-offender on two occasions. The first occasion occurred some time prior to September 2009. The co-offender provided alcohol to the complainant whilst the applicant was at the movies. At some stage during the evening the co-offender and the complainant went for a walk. Whilst walking the co-offender had a conversation with the complainant in relation to sexual matters, including asking the complainant if she ""touched herself."" When the complainant said that she did not, the co-offender asked the complainant, ""why not?"" The co-offender told the complainant that a boy that she was interested in liked girls who were ""good with their hands"". He also spoke to the complainant about his desire to be her ""first kiss"" and told her that he was prepared to give her a ""lesson"" on sex if she wanted it.
6Some time later the applicant returned. She and the co-offender then showed the complainant pictures of an adult dating website and a picture of each of them naked.
7A few weeks after the first visit, and prior to the complainant's 15th birthday, the complainant again attended at the applicant's home. The complainant went with her older sister who also slept the night there. The co-offender again took the complainant for a walk. He reminded her of his offer to give her a ""lesson"" on sex and said that ""we always do this"" and that the complainant's sister had done it and she was fine with it.
8When they returned home the co-offender went outside for a cigarette and the complainant joined him. The co-offender again applied pressure to the complainant asking her if he could be her first kiss. He touched the complainant on the breasts.
9The complainant went back inside and had a shower. She was told to meet the applicant in the bedroom.  The complainant, who was terrified, walked into the bedroom where she saw the applicant in bed.  The co-offender then entered the bedroom, took off his clothes and also got into the bed.
10The co-offender removed the complainant's top and started to touch her breasts. The applicant also touched the complainant's breasts with her hands. Both offenders began to touch the complainant's breasts with their mouths. These acts were the subject of the Indecent Assault of a child under 16 years old charge (sequence 2).
11The co-offender pulled down the complainant's pants and inserted his finger into her vagina. This continued for a short period of time. This act was the subject of the charge of Aggravated Sexual Intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16 years (sequence 5).
12The offenders then produced a silver bullet style vibrator which the co-offender inserted into the complainant's vagina. This act was the subject of the charge of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16 years which was placed on a Form 1 to the sequence 5 offence (outlined in the paragraph above).
13The co-offender then performed oral sex on the complainant during which time the applicant was touching the complainant's breasts. The act of cunnilingus was the subject of the aggravated sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16 years offence (sequence 7).
14The co-offender then suggested that the applicant perform oral sex on him, which she did. As that occurred the co-offender asked the complainant to touch his penis and lick his nipples. The victim did not comply. These acts formed the basis of the aggravated act of indecency towards a child under 16 years charge (sequence 8).
15Whilst the applicant was performing oral sex on the co-offender, the co-offender touched the complainant's breasts. The touching of the breasts was the subject of an aggravated indecent assault charge which was placed on a Form 1 to the sequence 5 offence of aggravated sexual intercourse charge.
16The sexual encounter ended when the co-offender ejaculated. The complainant then got dressed, left the room and went to sleep in the lounge room. The next day the offenders drove her home and were invited to stay by the complainant's parents, which they did.
17The complainant disclosed the events constituting the various offences to her older sister in July 2010. The applicant and her co-offender were arrested on 23 July 2010. When interviewed by the police the applicant admitted to carrying out certain sexual acts upon the complainant. She stated that she had a sexual conversation with the complainant that progressed into her and her co-offender suggesting they move into the bedroom. She stated that she knew what she was doing was illegal and wrong. She said that she and her co-offender were aroused by the sexual acts and were further aroused when later discussing what had occurred. The applicant told the police that she and her co-offender were members of an online swingers club and that she may have shown that website to the victim.
18The application for leave to appeal was filed out of time. However, the Crown raised no objection to an extension of time being granted and in my opinion this is appropriate. 
19There are two grounds of appeal, although they significantly overlap. The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge erred by imposing cumulative sentences in relation to each offence with the consequence that the overall sentence that was imposed was manifestly excessive.
20The sentences that his Honour imposed were structured so that there is a partial accumulation of each of the sentences. This resulted in an overall period of accumulation of 18 months. The degree of accumulation in the case of sequence 2 (the touching of the victim's breasts with hands and mouths) was only 3 months. For sequence 7 (the cunnilingus on the complainant) it was 6 months. For the sequence 5 (the digital penetration that had the serious matters on the Form 1 attached to it) there was a period of 9 months accumulation.
21The applicant submitted that because all of the offences were part of a single discrete episode of criminality and had many features in common, a high degree of concurrency was called for. The applicant emphasised that the sentencing judge found that, although there were a number of separate acts upon the complainant, they were part of the one sequence of events that occurred in a relatively short time and that the incident was an isolated one. It was also submitted that the offence of aggravated indecent assault was the only offence that was subject to a standard non-parole period (8 years) and that his Honour considered that the objective gravity of that offence fell below the middle range of objective seriousness. The applicant emphasised the fact that his Honour also accepted that the applicant was entitled to the maximum available discount for her early plea of guilty.
22The applicant also emphasised that the offences were committed when she was aged 22; she came from a supportive family background and had no prior criminal history; she had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and dependent personality disorder. The applicant also emphasised that her husband was her first sexual partner.
23The applicant also emphasised that although both her pre-sentence report and a psychiatrist's report recommended that she undergo extensive treatment to address her offending behaviour, the only prospect of her receiving treatment would be upon her release.
24This Court has said on many occasions that the decision as to whether to accumulate in respect of multiple sentences is fundamentally an exercise within the discretion of the sentencing judge. As Simpson J observed in R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7] ""There will be many cases in which sentencing judges might take differing views but neither view could be said to be wrong.""
25The issue of totality, particularly in a case involving sexual offending, was discussed by this Court in R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; 164 A Crim R 326 at [13] where Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ stated:
""In some case the fact that a sentence for a particular offence is to be served completely concurrently with another sentence for a different offence will result in a sentence that is erroneously inadequate because it does not reflect the totality of the criminality for which the offender was to be punished for the two acts of offending ... This may be so even if the two offences arise from the same precise criminal act, such as the dangerous driving of a motor vehicle on the one occasion... The same principle has been applied to sexual assault offences arising from a single incident of sexual assault: R v Gorman [2002] NSWCCA 516; (2002) 137 A Crim R 326.""
26In Gorman Sperling J said at [57]:
""Relevantly the offences in the present case were committed in the course of the same episode. His Honour so found. However, each offence contributed to the total criminality involved and care had to be taken to ensure that the overall effective sentence was appropriate having regard to the offences which were committed in the course of that episode.""
27Similar observations are appropriate in the present case. The applicant was involved with her co-offender in a variety of sexual acts upon the complainant. Each act involved separate criminality of varying degrees of significance. Although part of an overall event, the sentencing judge was required to identify a sentence appropriate for each separate act. No complaint is made about the term of any of the individual sentences. The sentencing judge was mindful of the matters to which I have referred in [21], [22] and [23] above. The sentencing judge was then required to determine how the sentences should be structured ensuring that the overall sentence was appropriate for the total criminality involved. In my opinion, although I may have provided a different structure, his Honour's structure of the sentences was open to him and I am not persuaded that the sentencing discretion has miscarried in a manner that would require the intervention of this Court.
28Although I would grant leave to appeal, the appeal should be dismissed.
Orders
1. Grant leave to appeal.2. Dismiss the appeal.
29PRICE J:  I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.
30BARR AJ:  I agree for the reasons given by McClellan CJ at CL that the sentences imposed and the total effective sentence fell within the range of discretion resting in the sentencing judge. I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL.

2418442,Raad v R [2012] NSWCCA 268,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: At about 5am in the early hours of Sunday morning, 31 May 2009, there was a robbery at the Lakes Hotel, Rosebery, in the south of Sydney. As the hotel was closing after Saturday night trading, Tevi Koloamatangi, armed with a Ruger pistol, approached three men who were leaving the hotel and forced them back inside at gunpoint. According to the prosecution case, Emad Raad, the present applicant, was waiting nearby in a car. The car was driven by Nicholas Faraj. One of the men taken hostage as he was leaving the hotel was a security officer, Silivesiteli Lopeti. Mr Lopeti was a relative of Mr Koloamatangi and was believed to have had an involvement in planning the attempted robbery.

2The licensee of the hotel lived on the premises and was able, unbeknownst to Mr Koloamatangi, to call police, who arrived in force shortly after the robbery commenced. The senior officer, Sergeant de Lorenzo, arrived armed with a taser, but without his Glock pistol. Having used his taser without noticeable effect, Sergeant de Lorenzo was forced to seek cover, as he was fired upon by Mr Koloamatangi. He was able to obtain a pistol from a colleague and several shots were exchanged. Both Sergeant de Lorenzo and Mr Koloamatangi were injured. Mr Koloamatangi fired three shots in the course of the exchange. He eventually surrendered at about 10:00am.

3Following the police investigation, charges were laid against Koloamatangi, Raad, Faraj and Lopeti. All four stood trial together. It was not suggested that either Mr Faraj or the applicant was in the hotel or wielding a firearm: the case against them was run on the basis of a common purpose by participating in a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Koloamatangi. Critical evidence inculpating Raad and Faraj in the Lakes Hotel robbery and shooting was given by Koloamatangi's girlfriend, Yasmin Ahearn. 

4At the commencement of the trial, on 2 March 2011, Mr Koloamatangi entered pleas of guilty to four offences, namely aggravated armed robbery (count 1), two offences of detaining employees of the Lakes Hotel for advantage (counts 2 and 3) and wounding Sergeant De Lorenzo with intent to prevent his lawful apprehension (count 7). He stood trial in respect of an offence of shooting at Sergeant de Lorenzo with intent to murder him and was found guilty by a jury (count 4). On 23 May 2011 he was sentenced in the District Court, although certain sentences were later increased by this Court on a prosecution appeal: R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288.

5While there were seven counts in the indictment, not all accused were charged in respect of all counts. Thus, Mr Lopeti was charged on counts 2 and 3 with respect to detaining the two hostages (other than himself) with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely to rob the Lakes Hotel. The applicant was not charged with those offences.

6The primary charge (count 1) involved robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a firearm. Mr Raad was convicted on that count and sentenced to six years imprisonment, comprising a non-parole period of three years to date from 15 June 2011 and an additional term of three years. He is still serving the non-parole period for that offence, which is due to expire on 14 June 2014. He was further charged with shooting at Sergeant de Lorenzo with intent to murder (count 4) and, in the alternative, discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Sergeant de Lorenzo (count 5). The applicant was convicted on count 4, with the result that no verdict was taken with respect to the alternative count. For that offence he was sentenced to imprisonment for seven years, comprising a non-parole period of four years to date from 15 June 2012, expiring on 14 June 2016, with an additional term of three years.

7Count 6 alleged that the applicant did wound Sergeant de Lorenzo with intent to murder him; an alternative charge (count 7) alleged that he wounded Sergeant de Lorenzo intending to prevent the lawful apprehension of Tevi Koloamatangi. The applicant was acquitted on count 6 and convicted on count 7. On count 7 he was sentenced to imprisonment for six years, comprising a non-parole period of four years to date from 15 June 2011, expiring on 14 June 2015, with an additional term of two years.

8Mr Lopeti was acquitted on all counts. The jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict in respect of Mr Faraj, on all counts with which he was charged.

Issues on appeal
9The applicant sought leave to appeal against his convictions. The grounds of appeal lodged on behalf of the applicant on 11 May 2012, more than a year after the trial and almost 12 months after the sentencing hearing, contained two broad grounds, namely:

(1) the verdicts of guilty on counts 1, 4 and 7 are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence;
(2) the directions given by the learned trial judge in relation to the unreliability of the witness Ms Ahern were inadequate.

These grounds were given some substance by the written submissions filed for the applicant on the same date.

10Although Mr Raad was referred to throughout those submissions as ""the appellant"" the grounds did not involve ""a question of law alone"" and hence required leave: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5(1). In the event that the appeal was successful in part, but not in whole, leave was sought to appeal against sentence in respect of any remaining count.

11Some detail with respect to his co-accused will be relevant because the applicant sought to rely upon the refusals of the jury to convict either of his co-accused Lopeti and Faraj on any counts despite, as he asserted, significant common elements in the evidence against each. These circumstances, he submitted, rendered the verdicts against him unreasonable or unsupportable. It is necessary for this Court to make its own assessment of the whole of the evidence: SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11] - [14] (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ).

12Because the applicant (and Faraj and Lopeti) did not actually participate in the robbery, the detaining of hostages or the shooting, their liability depended upon their participation in a joint criminal enterprise. With respect to the offences involving use of the firearm, the jury was directed that even if such criminal activity was not part of the agreement, those involved in the joint criminal enterprise would be liable if ""the joint enterprise had contemplated that other crime as a possible incident in the execution of the agreed crime"" and that what was contemplated by the parties was ""the substantial risk, not merely a slender chance, that the other crime will be committed"": MFI 25, elements document. The applicant did not challenge the terms of the direction in that regard. He accepted that the direction adequately reflected the elements, including the actual contemplation of possible consequences, referred to in McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108 at 115, referring to the reasons of Mason, Murphy and Wilson JJ in Johns v The Queen [1980] HCA 3; 143 CLR 108 at 130-131.

Background circumstances
13On 29 May 2009 Ms Ahearn, Mr Koloamatangi and Emad Raad (also known as Eddie) had been involved in a house invasion and robbery at an address in Narwee. All three received sentences of imprisonment in respect of that offending. Ms Ahearn's role was known to the jury because she was cross-examined as to the benefits she had obtained, both by reference to her period in custody and not being charged with respect to her involvement in the Lakes Hotel robbery.

14The events surrounding the present charges commenced on the evening of 29 May 2009. In his address to the jury, the prosecutor identified this as the first set of circumstances on which reliance was placed in the case against the applicant, because, it was alleged, they demonstrated that the Ruger 357 magnum used by Mr Koloamatangi was owned by the applicant. 

15Ms Ahearn gave evidence that she and the applicant picked up a car belonging to the applicant's father and drove past the applicant's premises at Elphinstone Road, South Coogee in the afternoon of 29 May 2009. They noticed a police car out the front, at which stage the applicant became ""somewhat agitated"" and said words to the effect, ""I've got my piece in my place under my bed"", referring, as she understood it, to a gun: Tcpt, 17/03/11, p 449. Ahearn, the applicant and Koloamatangi then planned for Mr Koloamatangi to go into the applicant's flat to retrieve the gun whilst the applicant and Ms Ahearn would be ""the eyes and the ears"" outside. She was in a car driven by Mr Faraj (known as Nick) who was the applicant's cousin. Mr Koloamatangi went to the premises by taxi; the applicant was believed by Ms Ahearn to be in the cemetery at Coogee, or nearby: Tcpt, p 452. Mr Koloamatangi was successful in retrieving the gun.

16Mr Raad's account of the evening was similar to that of Ms Ahearn in a number of respects. He agreed that he had been driving his father's car but had returned it during the course of the evening. He agreed that he had rung Mr Faraj to see if he could ""get a lift, get a lift around by him"": Tcpt, p 689(47). Having dropped off his father's car at Kingsford, he then caught a taxi to Mr Faraj's home in Alexandria. From there Mr Faraj drove him and Ms Ahearn to South Coogee. He further agreed that Ms Ahearn and Mr Faraj remained in the car, but said that he (Raad) went inside and collected a laptop and phone charger.

17Mr Raad was cross-examined as to why he had needed to ask Mr Faraj to drive him around when he had been with Ms Ahearn in his father's car at about 8pm. He said it was because his father wanted the car back by midnight, although the explanation might have been considered thin by the jury, given there was a period of four hours during which he could have driven to his premises at South Coogee: Tcpt, pp 722-723. He further said it was a complete surprise to discover a paper in his flat indicating that the police had been there and executed a search warrant, but did not mention it to either Mr Faraj or Ms Ahearn when he returned to the car: Tcpt, p 726.

18In submissions to the jury, counsel for Mr Raad suggested that Ms Ahearn's story as to recovering the gun was quite implausible given that it assumed a police search (which had in fact taken place) during which the gun had not been discovered. It was more plausible, counsel submitted, that Mr Raad never had such a gun.

19The second circumstance relied upon in the prosecution case against Mr Raad was evidence of the delivery of a floral suitcase to Mr Lopeti's garage in Brussels Street, Mascot in the morning of Saturday, 30 May. That there was such a suitcase was confirmed by Mr Lopeti's partner. However, Mr Raad denied that he had taken the suitcase to Lopeti's premises on Saturday.

20The significance of the floral suitcase was somewhat obscure. Ms Ahearn's evidence that the applicant had left the suitcase placed him at Mr Lopeti's house on the Saturday morning whilst Mr Koloamatangi was present. Mr Raad gave evidence that he was not present and was at the home of a friend of Mr Koloamatangi, known as CJ. Mr Lopeti's partner, Ms Mouldey, confirmed the presence of the suitcase and gave evidence that it contained women's clothes. In his final address, counsel for the applicant told the jury that the relevance of the suitcase ""escapes me at the moment, but in any event [I] will come back to that a little bit later"": p 1028(14). It does not appear that he did return to the topic. Counsel for Mr Lopeti suggested that the gun had been in the bag and had been recovered by someone during the night, but that appears to have been entirely speculative: Tcpt, p 994(20).

21Although there appears to have been no other serious contender for delivering the suitcase, the jury may have had some doubt as to Mr Raad's role in the matter or at least his knowledge of the owner of the premises, as the applicant denied having met Mr Lopeti, prior to 31 May 2009.

22The third set of circumstances relied upon by the prosecutor (Tcpt, p 936) were the events at the Mansions Hotel in Rushcutters Bay during the night of Saturday, May 30. Earlier in the evening, Mr Raad had been to the Chamberlain Hotel in Haymarket with his girlfriend Ms Hiriaki (known as Jada), where they won money on the poker machines. (Mr Raad was to return to a room in the hotel later on Sunday morning, after the robbery.) There was closed circuit television (CCTV) evidence which placed Mr Raad, Ms Hiriaki, Mr Koloamatangi and Ms Ahearn at the Mansions Hotel in the early hours of Sunday morning. Mr Faraj was not present, but Mr Raad telephoned him at 2:19am inviting him to come to the hotel. It was apparent that Mr Faraj was not there to join the party as within two minutes of his arrival he, Mr Raad and Mr Koloamatangi left. Mr Raad agreed he had been at the hotel and that he and Koloamatangi and the women had come from CJ's place to celebrate his, CJ's, birthday.

23Mr Raad suggested that when he left with Mr Koloamatangi, Mr Koloamatangi was not feeling well. That, the prosecutor suggested, was a fabrication used as a cover for their purposes thereafter. It was clear from the CCTV records, as well as the telephone records, that the men left the Mansions Hotel at 2:37am.

24Ms Ahearn did not see Mr Koloamatangi again that night, although she and Ms Hiriaki were to meet Mr Raad and Mr Faraj at the Chamberlain Hotel in Haymarket, after the aborted armed robbery, on Sunday morning. According to her evidence, she was to learn some aspects of the events that occurred after the men left the Mansions Hotel. The log of mobile phone calls confirms that Mr Raad was in Rosebery by 3:10am and that Ms Ahearn was still near Kings Cross. According to Ms Ahearn, she and Ms Hiriaki attempted to contact the applicant and Mr Koloamatangi around 3:30am because they were hungry but had no money for food. Ms Hiriaki eventually contacted the applicant who told them to catch a taxi to Botany Road, Mascot where he would meet them at Garlo's Pies and pay for the cab. The applicant met them in a car driven by Mr Faraj and shortly thereafter dropped them on Maroubra Road near Ms Hiriaki's home. Ms Ahearn described the two men as ""frantic because they had to be somewhere"" and as being ""a bit dishevelled, like a bit in a hurry"": p 471(40)-(48). They said ""they had to be back at the Lakes by 4"": p 472(1)-(5). Again, the timing was consistent with the phone records of Ms Ahearn calling Mr Koloamatangi at 3:23, 3:32 and 3:48am from Kings Cross, Edgecliff and Darlinghurst. There was a further call from her to Mr Koloamatangi at 3:54am from Kings Cross and a final call to him at 4:15am from Mascot. This was the fourth set of events relied upon by the prosecution, from which it could be inferred that both Mr Raad and Mr Faraj were aware of things planned at the Lakes around 4am.

25The applicant gave evidence that he and Faraj had dropped Mr Koloamatangi off at a spot on Sutherland Street near Brussels Street: Tcpt, p 701. It is likely that that had happened by 3:40am as Mr Koloamatangi sent text messages to the applicant at 3:40 and 3:44am, with responses from the applicant at 3:49, 3:52 and 3:53am. At 3:53am Mr Koloamatangi called the applicant and spoke for one and a half minutes; at 4am the applicant sent text messages to Mr Koloamatangi on two occasions and called him at 4:31am. Thereafter, there was no communication between them. All of the communications from the applicant after 3:10am, for which location towers are noted, emanated from Rosebery or Eastlakes. As the prosecution pointed out, there were 12 calls or text messages between the two over the period from 3:26 to 4:31am. This, it was suggested, was inconsistent with any suggestion that Mr Koloamatangi was ill. The fact that both were in the area of the Lakes Hotel throughout that period suggested that they were there for a common purpose.

26So far as the timing of the robbery was concerned, Mr Lopeti said in a statement to police that he finished securing the hotel at 4:20am, but then sat down to have a drink with two other members of staff for about an hour. That would have placed the time of the robbery at about 5:20am when the three men left the hotel. Very soon after the robbery commenced, the licensee, who was living on the premises, rang police. Curiously, there seems to have been no evidence as to the timing of that call, but Sergeant de Lorenzo responded to a call over the police radio network at 5.20am: Tcpt, p 230(20).

27At 5:58am, Ms Ahearn called the applicant. At 6:16 and 6:29am the applicant called Ms Ahearn from near Pitt and Campbell Streets in Haymarket. Ms Ahearn had spent the time from when she was dropped off with Ms Hiriaki and about 6am at Ms Hiriaki's parents' house. She said she had tried to ring Mr Koloamatangi because she was worried, not having heard from him: p 472(40)-(45). She received no reply, but spoke briefly to the applicant, who said ""I needed to hurry up and get to the Chamberlain Hotel, something's gone wrong. I need to get there straightaway. Yeah and he'll explain it all to me when I get there."" She caught a taxi to the Chamberlain Hotel and was met by the applicant who paid for the cab. They went upstairs into a hotel room where the only other person present was Mr Faraj. She said that this occurred about 6am: p 474(3). She was then asked to recount the conversation which she did in the following terms:

""Q. As best you can recollect, who said what in this room at the Chamberlain Hotel?
A. Eddie started saying, 'Oh you should've - said anything yes it was a set-up, I swear, there were just cops came from everywhere' - it was like a really full-on conversation.

Q. I want you to tell me the conversation?
A. He - like I just said - in about - hang on, sorry, and like and he was saying, you know that 'you should've seen them, it was like a sea of red and blue of the cop cars coming' and he said, 'I think Tevi's been shot, I think he's been shot, I think he's been shot and I think something's - something's not right, I they've either got him or he's - or he's been shot.'

Q. Anything else?
A. Not that I can recall of the top of my - sorry. Not that I can recall right now, sorry.

Q. What about Nick, did he say anything?
A. He was really freaked out, he was really worried.

Q. Did he say anything?
A. Yeah he was saying things to the same effect, like its - 'I swear yes it's a set up, you know it was a set up, they were waiting for us', just things like that, to that effect.""

28She said that they turned on the television to the Sunrise program on Channel 7 and watched the 6:30am news. Not long thereafter they left the hotel and went to CJ's place: p 475 (30).

29The final episode took place at ""CJ's place"", those present being ""CJ, his girlfriend, Eddie, myself and some guy I didn't know"": p 476(27). Ms Ahearn was asked whether the applicant had said anything more:

""Q. Can you tell me what he said?

...
A. He said about dropping - he dropped - he was trying to figure out how many bullets Tevi had and he said, 'I think he only had five because he dropped one and I had to pick it up.' 

...

Q. What's he referring to?
A. When Tevi was getting ready and loading the gun.

Q. What's being said about that?
A. He just went through like the whole plan of what had -

Q. Can you tell me what the plan was that he went through?
A. OK, Tevi was all dressed in black, he was supposed to jump out of the back of the car, run, stand in the bushes, when the Lakes' door got opened, when Cliff [Lopeti] took the last worker out, Eddie - Tevi was supposed to jump up, grab the last worker, boom, get the eff inside, take her in and do whatever then takes place.""

30The evidence then became confusing and there was a break, following which further evidence was given by Ms Ahearn (p 478-479):

""Q. All right, at CJ's place did Eddie say anything about what the plan was?
...

A. That Eddie - sorry, that Tevi was to get ready, get all blacked-up, like to get changed, sorry - that - and then he was to lay in the back of Nick's car, and, when they got to the Lakes he was to jump out, run over to - and hide like somewhere and wait for the last worker to walk out of the Lakes Hotel with Cliff and then when that last worker ... walked out, Tevi was to jump up, run, grab - and grab the last worker and take them back inside.

Q. Did he say in that conversation anything about anything that had happened that morning that he saw or witnessed?
A. Well, he said he heard a gunshot - or saw or witnessed, sorry - he was waiting and it was taking too long. So, all of a sudden he saw heaps of red and blue police lights, sorry - like a sea of red and blue coming, so immediately Nick and him left - Nick and Eddie left.
...

Q. Prior to morning tea, you'd said something about bullets. What was it that he said about bullets?
A. That when Eddie was loading the gun, he'd dropped a bullet, and that's why Eddie was trying to figure out how many gunshots he'd heard because trying to figure out - because there was a bullet dropped that Eddie had picked up and so he was trying to calculate how many fires had been shot from either end, from the police's end and from Tevi's end.""

Unreliability of Ms Ahearn
31There was no doubt that the case against the applicant turned squarely on the evidence given by Ms Ahearn. She was not an entirely articulate witness; she had received a reduction on her sentence on the Narwee home invasion in exchange for an undertaking to give evidence in relation to the Lakes Hotel robbery and had also received $700 from the police whilst in prison, over a 15 month period (much of which was spent on a television set and a doona). She agreed with all the propositions put to her in that regard. She agreed that she had told lies on various occasions and that she had used drugs since the age of 12. She had used ""ice"" on the day prior to the robbery.

32One factor relied upon by the applicant as part of a possible motive for Ms Ahearn to lie about his involvement, was her relationship with Mr Koloamatangi. In this Court the applicant's counsel described her as Mr Koloamatangi's girlfriend; the Director denied that the evidence went so far. Whatever the state of the evidence, the prosecutor referred to her as Mr Koloamatangi's girlfriend in his final address and it should be accepted that the case was presented on that basis: p 940(15). In any event, the strength of the attraction does not appear to have been a key issue with respect to her credibility in circumstances where the benefit to Mr Koloamatangi from her evidence was extremely limited.

33Despite her admissions as to past misconduct, her credibility was very much a matter for the jury. Her evidence as to her location and the presence of others, at various points in time over the 12 hours from 6pm on the evening before the robbery to 6am on the following morning was in conformity with the times and locations recorded on CCTV and mobile phone records. Although it was put to her that she was lying with respect to the conversations, of which there was no independent evidence, there was a degree of consistency between her answers and known events. By contrast, the evidence of Mr Raad in certain respects, such as his movements between 3am and 5:20am on the morning of 31 May, was implausible. Thus, for example, the prosecution put to the jury that despite his frequent communications with Mr Koloamatangi between 3:26 and 4:31am, the lack of communication thereafter was telling. The applicant had given evidence that he was to collect Mr Koloamatangi from near the Lakes Hotel at 5am and had been there, but had left at 5:20 when Mr Koloamatangi had not appeared and he saw red and blue lights. The fact that he made no attempt to call Mr Koloamatangi on his mobile rendered that account highly implausible. Similarly, his suggestion that Mr Koloamatangi had left the Mansions Hotel at around 3am because he was feeling ill was also implausible.

34Accepting that it is impossible to gain a real appreciation of the credibility of a witness from a transcript of the evidence, reading the examination-in-chief and cross-examination of Ms Ahearn in full leaves the impression that her evidence had a coherent theme in relation to the applicant, which may well have appeared credible to a jury. She conceded past failings of her own, without accepting broad insinuations in respect of her character. On the other hand, if the broad insinuations had been correct, it is doubtful that she could have concocted and maintained the coherent story which she told. Furthermore, it was not put to her in cross-examination that her evidence had been concocted with the assistance of police or anyone else. It was part of the defence case that she was seeking to shift the blame from her boyfriend, Mr Koloamatangi, to others, including the applicant, but it is difficult to see how anything she said which implicated Mr Raad or Mr Faraj could have had, or been believed to have had, such an effect.

35Putting to one side the separate and belated assertion that the verdicts in respect of Mr Lopeti and Mr Faraj demonstrated that the jury did not rely upon Ms Ahearn's evidence, there was no basis to treat the verdicts against the applicant as unreasonable or unsupportable with respect to counts 1 and 7. If the jury believed Ms Ahearn, there was, on an independent assessment of the quality and sufficiency of the evidence, ample evidence to conclude that the applicant had a common purpose with Mr Koloamatangi with respect to the armed robbery, including knowledge that Mr Koloamatangi had a gun which was loaded. (It will be necessary to return to the conviction on count 4 in due course.) Applying the test in SKA, the challenge to the convictions on that ground should be rejected.

Inconsistency of verdicts
36At the commencement of the hearing of the application for leave to appeal, senior counsel for the applicant raised the entirely novel proposition that Ms Ahearn's evidence could not be accepted as a sufficient basis for convictions on charges against the applicant when such evidence was not accepted by the jury as supporting similar charges against Mr Faraj and Mr Lopeti.

37It was suggested to counsel that the applicant would need leave to raise a ground as to which no hint had been given in the notice of appeal or the written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant. Counsel resisted that proposition on the basis that the first ground of appeal was wide enough to encompass the point sought to be argued. In a sense that was true, but only because the notice of appeal failed to allege with any particularity the basis upon which the convictions were said to be unreasonable or unsupportable and by ignoring the scope of the grounds as revealed in the written submissions. On the view that leave was necessary to raise a new point, the respondent objected to a grant of leave.

38It is not necessary for present purposes to decide whether leave was required: if there were a further ground upon which a conviction carrying a significant gaol sentence could be impeached, which is raised before the court reserves its judgment and in circumstances where any unfairness to the prosecution can be met by an appropriate adjournment, it is preferable that the issue be considered. That course should be taken in the present case.

39The difficulty for the applicant lies in the merit of the challenge. Ms Ahearn's evidence was not of a uniform quality, nor did she give similar evidence in respect of each co-offender. The critical matters of which the co-offenders must have been aware in order for their involvement in the activities to give rise to guilt based on common purpose were twofold, namely:

(a) knowledge that Mr Koloamatangi intended to carry out an armed robbery at the Lakes Hotel at around 4am on 31 May 2009, and 
(b) knowledge that Mr Koloamatangi would enter the hotel with a loaded firearm.

40Clearly those elements were satisfied in respect of Mr Koloamatangi himself and it was common ground that Ms Ahearn's evidence was of no more than peripheral significance in relation to his convictions. The cases in respect of Mr Lopeti and Mr Faraj, however, require further analysis.

(a) the case against Mr Lopeti
41Mr Lopeti had not been involved in the home invasion at Narwee. Prior to the Lakes Hotel robbery, he was not the subject of any police investigation. Indeed, he was accepted to be a man of good character and well-liked by his colleagues at the Lakes Hotel where he worked as a security officer.

42Mr Lopeti had no knowledge of or involvement with the following incidents (as described above):

(a) the recovery of the pistol from the applicant's unit;
(b) the events at the Mansions Hotel;
(c) the trip from the Mansions Hotel to the Lakes Hotel taken by Faraj, Raad and Koloamatangi;
(d) the collection of the two women at Garlo's Pies at Mascot by Mr Raad and Mr Faraj;
(e) the events outside the Lakes Hotel between 5am and 5:20am, as recounted by Mr Raad in his evidence;
(f) the conversation at the Chamberlain Hotel involving Mr Raad and Mr Faraj, and 
(g) the conversation at CJ's place concerning the loading of the gun.

Indeed, of the evidence discussed above, the only event which potentially involved Mr Lopeti was the delivery of the floral suitcase to his garage early on the previous morning, but before he had returned from the Lakes Hotel. This was the first event relied upon by the prosecution as linking Mr Lopeti to the common purpose.

43The second matter relied upon by the prosecution was a conversation between Mr Koloamatangi and Ms Ahearn when he showed her the gun which had been recovered from the applicant's unit and stated that he needed to get rid of it, saying words to the effect, ""I've got to go and see my uncle, because I've got to get rid of this"": p 456(5). Mr Lopeti was his uncle. She gave evidence that they had taken a cab to the Lakes Hotel and that she had been introduced to Mr Lopeti but had run across the road to the service station to use a toilet as the Hotel was closed: p 456(25). There was, therefore, conversation between them which she did not hear and some she heard but in a language she did not understand: p 458. She and Mr Koloamatangi then went to Mr Lopeti's home at Brussels Street, which was a little more than a kilometre from the hotel. While they were at Mr Lopeti's home (and in his absence) Mr Raad dropped off the floral suitcase. Ms Ahearn gave evidence of a conversation between the applicant and Mr Koloamatangi to the effect that it ""Looks like it's going to be the Lakes tonight bro"": p 460(10). Mr Lopeti was not there for that conversation, but when he came to the house Mr Koloamatangi handed over the gun to him. There was further conversation in Tongan, which she could not understand. At the end of the conversation she stated that there was a remark in English, ""Looks like it'll be about 4, 4:30 bro"": p 461(50). These words were used by Mr Koloamatangi addressing Mr Lopeti: p 462(20).

44This was one of two occasions (the other was at the Chamberlain Hotel) where Ms Ahearn attributed almost identical statements to two participants within a short period. A jury might have had real doubt as to whether these words were used in the conversation between Mr Koloamatangi and the applicant, or in the conversation he had with Mr Lopeti (or, of course, both).

45Thereafter, there was nothing in Ms Ahearn's evidence which linked Mr Lopeti with the crimes. The heart of the case against Mr Lopeti rested on his role at the Lakes Hotel itself. He was said to be a large well-built man, as might have been expected of a security guard. However, when Mr Koloamatangi approached with his gun, Mr Lopeti was holding the door open and apparently fell to his knees without releasing the door. Further, when Mr Koloamatangi forced the hostages inside, the CCTV showed Mr Lopeti behind Mr Koloamatangi rather than in front. At a later stage when one of the hostages sought to wrestle the gun from Mr Koloamatangi, Mr Lopeti provided no assistance.

46The strength of this evidence would have depended upon a number of circumstances, none of which involved the credibility of Ms Ahearn. The mere fact that the gun was left with Mr Lopeti, who may well have been licensed to hold a weapon, was inconclusive in relation to his knowledge of the intended robbery.

47The case against Mr Lopeti further depended upon lies which he told in relation to his knowledge that Mr Koloamatangi was the robber and of his relationship with Mr Koloamatangi. Again, these matters had nothing to do with the evidence of Ms Ahearn.

48In so far as the acquittals of Mr Lopeti were relied upon to demonstrate some inconsistency on the part of the jury in accepting Ms Ahearn's evidence against the applicant, the argument was without merit. To that extent, the ground must be rejected.

(b) involvement of Mr Faraj
49The evidence against Mr Faraj fell into quite a different category. It depended almost entirely on the evidence of Ms Ahearn. As has been explained above in describing the evidence she gave against Mr Raad, he was the driver responsible for ferrying Mr Raad and, on occasion, Mr Koloamatangi to their various destinations. He drove Ms Ahearn when she was keeping a lookout outside the applicant's unit, when as she said, Mr Koloamatangi was collecting the gun. However, for the most part, he appears to have been a silent witness to events. The only occasion when words were attributed to him which showed guilty knowledge was the meeting in the Chamberlain Hotel at 6am after the robbery, when words were attributed to him that ""it was a set-up, they were waiting for us"". However, those words were also attributed to Mr Raad and the jury may well have entertained a doubt as to whether they were in fact spoken by Mr Faraj.

50The other critical evidence related to knowledge of Mr Koloamatangi being armed with a loaded pistol. The applicant was aware of that fact, on Ms Ahearn's account of his conversation with her, because he had watched Mr Koloamatangi load the gun and drop a bullet in the car. It was Mr Faraj's car, but he was driving and there was no evidence as to where the applicant and Mr Koloamatangi were sitting at the time that occurred. It was at least plausible that they were both in the back seat. There was no direct evidence that Mr Faraj knew what had happened until after the event, when he, like Ms Ahearn, heard the applicant's description.

51The prosecution also relied to some extent on the evidence given by Ms Ahearn as to the dishevelled and anxious state of both men in the car when the two women were collected from Garlo's Pies at Mascot at around 4am. However, that evidence was not supported by Ms Hiriaki and was itself somewhat ambivalent, gaining its strength from the other evidence of surrounding events, at least with respect to the applicant.

52In his address, the prosecutor identified the first fact or circumstance involving Mr Faraj as the collection of the gun with Ms Ahearn in the car. He noted that there was no other involvement of Mr Faraj until the applicant summoned him to the Mansions Hotel around 2am on the morning of May 31. After noting the timing of his arrival, the prosecutor stated (p 943(25)-(28):

""As I say the proposition being put to you is that in reality Mr Faraj was the transport that was going to assist them in the operation at the Lakes Hotel later on and he was therefore attending the Mansions Hotel for the purpose of picking up Mr Koloamatangi and Mr Raad.""

53So much may be accepted: it went but a short distance in demonstrating Mr Faraj's state of knowledge as to the events that were to occur thereafter. The evidence of both the applicant and Mr Faraj was that they went to the Lakes Hotel and the applicant entered the hotel, at sometime after 3am. There was some discrepancy as to where Mr Koloamatangi was at that stage: p 943(45). 

54The prosecution then relied upon 30 minutes of CCTV footage to demonstrate that Mr Faraj's evidence that he spent some time filling up the car with petrol at the Caltex service station near the Lakes Hotel was false. However, the possibility that he took that step before or after the period covered by the CCTV footage allowed the inference that Mr Faraj was, as the prosecutor accepted, an unreliable, rather than an untruthful, witness: p 944(22)-(25).

55The prosecution was able to demonstrate that Mr Faraj drove around the area for some time, without any clear purpose. He also left with the applicant to pick up the two women at Garlo's Pies.

56Mr Faraj gave evidence of the place where he said he was waiting to pick up Mr Koloamatangi. Although the prosecutor sought to rely as against him on the absence of a phone call to inquire where Mr Koloamatangi was, as might have been expected if indeed they were waiting for him to complete his lawful business, the jury may well have accepted that the failure was that of Mr Raad, Mr Faraj being merely his driver.

57Reference has already been made to the conversation at the Chamberlain Hotel. In respect of the critical conversation at CJ's place, with respect to the loading of the pistol, the prosecutor conceded that there was ""some doubt as to whether Mr Faraj was still there"": in fact, Ms Ahearn's evidence suggested he was not.

58Mr Faraj made statements to the police and gave evidence. The prosecution was able to assert, no doubt with some purpose, that Mr Faraj told lies. However, to the extent that the jury were required to assess that material, it was not material having any basis in Ms Ahearn's evidence. As the respondent noted in submissions following the hearing of the appeal, Mr Faraj had significant evidence of good character, testified that he was not a drug user and had left CJ's place on the morning after the robbery because persons in the apartment were using drugs and he ""didn't want to smell them fumes"": p 805(5). He gave evidence that he suffered from an anxiety condition and depression and took medication: p 783(33)-(45). Ms Hiriaki said that he was ""always stressing out"": p 618(2). As the Director submitted, Mr Faraj ""may have presented as an anxious and even somewhat malleable individual who was merely a follower of the [applicant]"". 

59Again, the central role of Ms Ahearn's evidence in respect of the applicant is clearly distinguishable from the significance of her evidence with respect to Mr Faraj. The available explanation that, on the critical issues, the jury were simply unpersuaded to the necessary degree that Mr Faraj knew about the events planned for the early hours of the morning of 31 May provides an available explanation of the differing verdicts. Ms Ahearn's evidence can have played only a small part in that assessment. This aspect of the appeal should also be rejected.

Conviction on count 4
60Once it was accepted that the applicant was aware of the proposed robbery at the Lakes Hotel by Mr Koloamatangi and was also aware that Mr Koloamatangi would be armed with a loaded pistol, there were ample grounds to convict the applicant on count 1, of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon.

61Further, the fact that the gun was loaded with live bullets was sufficient to raise in the applicant's mind the possibility that the gun would be used and, if it were, someone might well be wounded. That it was likely to be used if police or security officers sought to apprehend Mr Koloamatangi provided a sufficient basis for a conviction on count 7 involving wounding of Sergeant de Lorenzo intending to prevent the lawful apprehension of Mr Koloamatangi. In other words, it was well within the range of possibilities that Mr Koloamatangi would so use the gun to prevent his own apprehension.

62What is more troubling is the conviction on count 4. It required the applicant to foresee the possibility that, if the police or other security officers sought to intervene, Mr Koloamatangi would shoot at one of them with intent to murder. Envisaging such a possibility would have required knowledge or a belief as to Mr Koloamatangi's character or capabilities and, possibly, his state of mind on that night, which would have taken the planned robbery beyond the range of possibilities created by the mere presence of a loaded pistol. With respect to Mr Koloamatangi, it was in effect only count 4, or its alternative, count 5, which was left to the jury. He was found guilty on count 4. As part of the evidence against him, there was a camera mounted on Sergeant de Lorenzo's taser which continued to operate after the taser had been discharged. It showed Mr Koloamatangi standing pointing the pistol, apparently directly at Sergeant de Lorenzo at close range and firing. The jury might well have wondered how the shot had missed. It was evidence from which the jury was well entitled to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to Mr Koloamatangi's intention at a critical time. However, that was not material which was available as against the applicant. 

63The prosecution treated as sufficient to establish the relevant common purpose, the applicant's knowledge that Mr Koloamatangi had taken a loaded pistol to effect a dangerous robbery, with the planned taking of a hostage. However, it was a large step to infer from those facts foresight of the possibility of shooting with intent to kill. 

64The exercise required of the jury depended upon them accepting Ms Ahearn's evidence as to what the applicant said had occurred in the car when loading the gun. It also required the rejection of Mr Raad's evidence in that regard. Beyond those circumstances, the jury's conclusion was not based upon the credibility or reliability of individual witnesses. Rather, it required an objective assessment, by way of inference, as to Mr Raad's state of mind prior to the actual events which occurred inside the Lakes Hotel. There was a real danger, however, that the jury drew the necessary inference from its knowledge of the events which in fact occurred at the Lakes Hotel and the limited level to which the foresight had to rise, namely merely ""a substantial risk"" of the further crime being committed. On the available evidence, the jury should not have been satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, of actual foresight. 

65In summing up this aspect of the prosecution case to the jury, the trial judge stated (p 52):

""The Crown submits that each of the three accused, Mr Faraj, Mr Raad and Mr Lopeti, knowing that Mr Koloamatangi was taking a loaded gun to perform the armed robbery, he contemplated or foresaw as a possible incident of the robbery that the gun would be used and that the police would arrive, and in respect of count four, that each of those three accused contemplated or foresaw as reasonably possible those two matters I have just referred to, the gun will be used, the police would arrive, that a person would be shot, that that person would be a police officer and that Mr Koloamatangi would shoot the police officer with the intention to kill him. So the Crown says for all those reasons you would be satisfied as to count four.""

66The summary of the prosecution case was appropriate and sufficient up to the last element. In effect, it treated all three co-offenders as in the same position, including Mr Faraj who, on any view, had limited acquaintance with Mr Koloamatangi. That conventional directions had earlier been given with respect to the burden of proof and the elements of the particular offences (at pp12-13) did not, in all the circumstances, overcome the risks with respect to that particular element. While there was no challenge to the adequacy of the directions given by the trial judge with respect to count 4, it would have required a strong direction to be given with careful reference to the dangers noted above, if a conviction of the applicant on count 4 were to withstand challenge. 

67It is sufficient to conclude that, as the matter was left with the jury, there was a miscarriage in this respect. Given the real doubt as to whether a jury fully apprised of the dangers could convict on the evidence presented, it is not an appropriate case in which to order a retrial. Accordingly, the verdict on count 4 should be set aside and acquittal entered in its place.

Jury directions 
68The second ground of appeal asserted that the directions given by the trial judge in relation to the unreliability of Ms Ahearn were inadequate. This ground was not addressed to the direction with respect to count 4 to which reference was made above. 

69It was not in dispute that there were aspects of Ms Ahearn's circumstances which rendered her evidence potentially unreliable. She was, the applicant submitted, a person who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings, so as to invoke the requirements of s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW): s 165(1)(d). It was accepted that the trial judge was requested to warn the jury that her evidence might be unreliable: s 165(2). A warning was given to the jury and in terms which extended beyond the requirements of s 165. 

70Appropriately, the initial warning was given at an early stage of the summing-up, after the trial judge had summarised significant aspects of the prosecution case, by reference to the evidence of Ms Ahearn. Her Honour commenced with the following statement (p 24):

""It will be clear to you that the Crown case in respect of Mr Raad, Mr Faraj and Mr Lopeti rests heavily on the evidence of Yasmine Ahearn and I am going to give you some directions and warnings about her evidence. I am giving them to you at this point because I have referred to some of her evidence in summarising the Crown's case against Mr Raad, but that does not mean that these warnings and directions relate only to the case against Mr Raad. They relate to Ms Ahearn's evidence as it applies to Mr Faraj, Mr Lopeti and Mr Raad.""

71The warning included reference to Ms Ahearn's sentence in respect of the Narwee matter and the fact that she had obtained a discount for future assistance to the authorities (p 25); reference was made to the likely consequence if she failed to keep her promise; the fact that she was paid money by the police whilst in prison; the fact that she had admitted lying in the past and the extent to which there was independent support for her evidence.

72The applicant made three complaints about the direction. First, he submitted that the warning ""did not extend beyond a level of abstraction that lacked reference to the specific matters that caused Ms Ahearn's evidence to be unreliable"". That complaint involved a value judgment as to how much detail to include. As already noted, the warning identified specific matters which could render her evidence unreliable. If something more precise had been required, it should have been identified. More importantly, the terms of any further warning should have been identified at trial and a request made for a further direction: that did not happen. The first complaint should be rejected.

73The second complaint was more specific. While accepting that reference had been made to the 15% discount for future assistance, the applicant submitted that no mention had been made ""of the undertaking/immunity she received in respect of any prosecutions for the Lakes Hotel incident"". This, too, was a matter which required careful attention to the precise nature of the warning sought. The evidence did not rise to the level of any ""immunity"" in respect of the Lakes Hotel incident. There was, however, evidence that she had been given an undertaking that she would not be prosecuted on the basis of the assistance provided to police. This does not appear to have been a matter which loomed large in the case for any of the accused. Indeed, there may have been forensic reasons for not emphasising such a matter, and for not seeking a direction from the trial judge which would have the effect of emphasising the issue. On the one hand, her evidence did not suggest any significant involvement in the planning of the robbery and she was certainly not party to its execution. On the other hand, the closer she was to the events (and thus the greater the benefit from a promise not to be charged), the more likely her evidence was to be reliable, so long as it was truthful. Again, absent a specific request for an additional direction, there is no proper basis for intervention by this Court.

74A second limb of this complaint related to the lack of mention made of ""the sum of money Ms Ahearn received from the police prior to giving evidence at trial"". While it is true that the specific amount was not mentioned in the summing-up, the trial judge expressly referred to submissions that she was ""motivated to make false statements to the police because she was paid money by them while she was in prison"": p 26. Her denial as to making false statements was also noted. It is true that there was evidence of the sum involved ($700), about which she was cross-examined. Again, it cannot be said that the warning was inadequate because the precise sum was not mentioned; and again there was no request to do so. The second complaint must be rejected. 

75The third complaint was of a different nature. It appeared to have two elements to it. The first was that what was required was a warning as to ""the effect"" that the benefits may have had on the truthfulness of Ms Ahearn's evidence. The submission continued:

""Indeed, this is the purpose behind a judicial warning, to inform jury members of matters concerning the reliability of witnesses that they are otherwise unfamiliar with and that are peculiarly within the knowledge of the courts.""

76The assumption underlying this complaint should be accepted: its application in the present case is another matter. The trial judge did state that warnings and directions of the type she was giving flowed from ""experience the courts have accumulated over the years which shows that evidence of witnesses in a similar position to Ms Ahearn is often unreliable"": p 24. She continued:

""I am not suggesting that evidence from such a witness is always unreliable, but because the evidence from such witnesses may be unreliable, for that reason alone you should approach Ms Ahearn's evidence with considerable caution.

Experience has shown that there may be many possible reasons why a person in Ms Ahearn's position may give evidence which is unreliable. I am going to give you some examples of things that the courts have come across over the years. They do not necessarily apply in this case.""

77The summing-up continued by reference to standard examples of persons wishing to shift blame, to incriminate others because of feelings of dislike or hostility, to obtain a reduction of their sentences and to continue falsehoods because they feel ""locked in"". The important matter which would not have been within the experience of jurors concerned the discount for future assistance. In that respect, the trial judge gave a full explanation of the sentence imposed, the discount for a plea, the further discount for past assistance and the discount for future assistance, ""that is her promise to give evidence in this trial"": p 25. The summing-up continued:

""You heard, and it is the law, that if Ms Ahearn had not kept her promise to give evidence in this trial the Crown could take her to a higher court, an appeal court, and ask that court to increase her sentence by the amount her sentence was reduced by for her promise of future assistance, giving evidence in this trial.

Ms Ahearn denied when it was put to her that she was lying in her evidence to avoid a few more months in gaol. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Lopeti and Mr Faraj and Mr Raad that Ms Ahearn made false statements to the police about them, and maintained those false statements in her evidence, here, to keep her sentence reduction.""

78The nature of the risk in this respect was identified and the jury can have been in no doubt that she had obtained a benefit from her past assistance and had a significant incentive to provide further assistance. Again, what more was required was not the subject of any proposed direction, suggested in this Court, or requested of the trial judge.

79With respect to other matters, none of which were identified as deficient, it could hardly have been in doubt that the jury understood the basis of potential unreliability. The scope and nature of her propensity to lie when it suited her, with little regard to any moral or other obligation to tell the truth, had been fully explored in her cross-examination and in addresses. No juror could have been in doubt as to its relevance to the issues to be determined. The first element of this complaint is without substance and should be rejected.

80The second element is somewhat different: the complaint was that the summing-up failed to constitute a warning from the trial judge, ""with the authority of the judge being used to impress the significance of the matter on the collective mind of the jury"", but rather constituted ""a repetition of counsels' arguments"". In support of this submission, the applicant referred to the remarks of this Court in R v TJF [2001] NSWCCA 127; 120 A Crim R 209 at [66] (Studdert J; Beazley JA and Sperling J agreeing). The passage asserted that whilst counsel may well have reminded the jury of the specific features of the complainant's evidence calling for caution, ""what counsel may have said in address and what the judge may have said in his summing up by way of reminding the jury of the submissions of counsel, does not substitute for a direction of principle, stated by the judge to be such, in the context of informing the members of the jury of the principles of law which they were required to apply to their deliberations"".

81That passage, relied upon by the applicant, is not precisely to the point: explaining the need for caution in respect of elements of unreliability of evidence does not involve a statement of legal principle. It is a legal principle that the warning is required and must be given by the trial judge. It is also a legal principle that statements by counsel emphasising the need for caution will not substitute for such a warning.

82The warning given in fact took both courses, correctly. It identified the reason for giving warnings about such evidence and, to the extent that it was not obvious, explained the sources of unreliability. It also explained the matters relied upon by reference to the evidence of Ms Ahearn. There was no failure to give a warning because counsel had said enough in addresses; there was no parroting of what had been said in addresses, nor did the trial judge suggest that the warnings did not carry the authority of the law and accumulated judicial experience. This ground must be rejected.

83Finally, the applicant noted that further directions had been sought by counsel for Mr Lopeti in which the last point was directly raised: Summing-up, p 57. The following exchange occurred (p 58):

""HER HONOUR: I don't think my direction is deficient in that regard, I certainly told them. I mean I think I raised every issue that has been raised and I told them I was giving them warnings. 

RUSSELL: Your Honour is familiar with [R v TJF], does your Honour need me to hand that up or no?

HER HONOUR: No thank you.

RUSSELL: Thank you your Honour. Well I have put the point your Honour, thank you very much for the opportunity to put those matters and does your Honour propose to -

HER HONOUR: I will tell them about the no corroboration point.

RUSSELL: Thank you very much your Honour.

HER HONOUR: Mr Crown, ... do you think the 165 direction is deficient, do I need?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: I thought you Honour covered the territory and explained to the jury why it was the direction was being given.

84Mr Russell was appearing for Mr Lopeti. It is apparent that he did not seek any specific further direction. Further, when, at the completion of the summing-up, the trial judge asked if anyone had anything further, counsel for the applicant stated (Summing-up, p 55):

""I have nothing to raise your Honour.""

85Where counsel for one accused squarely raises an issue, but the submission is not expressly supported by counsel for the co-accused, the Court might well allow the co-accused to rely upon that submission, despite the terms of Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4. However, the exchange between counsel for Mr Lopeti and the trial judge did not engage r 4: no further direction was sought.

86For the reasons already given, there is no reason to suppose there was any deficiency in the summing-up with respect to the matters complained of. Had there been, it is, for the reasons stated, a clear case in which further directions might have been sought, but were not. The terms of r 4 are thus engaged. Leave to raise ground 2 should be refused. Were leave to be granted, the ground would be rejected.

Conclusion
87The result is that the applicant should be given leave to appeal against his convictions; his conviction on count 4 should be set aside and an acquittal entered in its place. The appeal should otherwise be dismissed, subject to his entitlement to make further submissions with respect to his sentence.

88It will be recalled that the sentence on count 4 was accumulated on the other (concurrent) sentences by a period of 12 months. If that sentence were merely set aside, his sentence on count 7, involving a non-parole period of four years to date from 15 June 2011, would remain as the longer of the two remaining sentences. It is not immediately apparent why the Court would interfere with that sentence, on the basis that the conviction on count 4 was set aside. It had a commencement date which was the same as the sentence on count 1 and the nature of the offending was not rendered less serious by reason of the acquittal on count 4. 

89Indeed, the applicant may be considered fortunate in being able (as the matter presently stands) to take advantage of the absence of a conviction in respect of count 5 which would also have carried a significant additional sentence. Nevertheless, these are matters which may be addressed in any further submissions.

90The Court should direct that any further submissions in respect of sentence should be filed and served according to the following timetable:

(a) submissions by the applicant by 16 January 2013;

(b) submissions in reply on behalf of the Director by 30 January 2013.

If the parties do not wish to make further submissions in respect of sentence, the Court should be so advised within those times.

91ADAMS J: I agree with Basten JA. Furthermore, applying the test in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13, I am satisfied that the verdicts of guilty on counts 1 and 7 are not unreasonable and can be supported having regard to the evidence.

92R A HULME J: I agree with the reasons for judgment of Basten JA and the orders he proposes. I confirm that upon my own assessment of the evidence concerning counts 1 and 7 I have no doubt that the applicant was rightly convicted.

2418459,R v Alexandrou [2012] NSWDC 312,"SentENCE


1HIS HONOUR: Mr Alexandrou remain seated, I will ask you to stand when I give the orders. I have to give reasons for my judgment. I am just telling you in advance what sentence I propose to impose for this matter. 

2The starting point of the sentence I propose to impose is six years imprisonment, but you are entitled to a discount of 25 per cent for the otherwise appropriate sentence to represent the utilitarian value of your plea of guilty. So the total sentence will be fixed at four years and six months.

3That sentence will date one year and three months into your current balance of parole; that is, it will date from 3 April 2013, and in relation to that sentence I propose to fix a non-parole period of two years five months and a balance of sentence of two years one month.

4The effective non-parole period, taking into account the balance of sentence to give effect to totality principle, is three years and six months. Whether you are released to parole on this occasion or not will be a matter for the Parole Authority, I hope the Parole Authority will take appropriate steps to see that the relevant mechanisms are in place to assist you on your release, and I will give my reasons for arriving at that decision now.

5Emanuel Alexandrou appears for sentence today in relation to an offence, to which he pleaded guilty at the Magistrate's court, contrary to s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900. The crime to which he pleaded guilty was the offence of attempting to commit robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon at Wiley Park on the third day of January 2012. The person he attempted to rob was Thi Do(?), and he attempted to rob that person of an amount of money, the property of Thi Do. The offence to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.

6As I foreshadowed in my introductory remarks when I told the prisoner the orders I was proposing to make, I am according the prisoner a discount of 25 per cent to represent the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty.

7The prisoner was arrested on the day of the offence and has been in custody since that date. The prisoner however was on parole in relation to sentences, the detail of which I will outline later, but which included sentences for the offence of armed robbery. He was released on parole on 25 July 2011 and his parole was effectively revoked from 3 January 2012 when he came into custody. That left a balance of sentence to be served, arising from his revocation of parole, of two years six months and 23 days. The expiry date of which, I am informed, currently is 25 July 2014.

8Of course, without other sentences imposed notwithstanding the fact his parole was revoked, the Parole Authority could review his situation from time to time. Revocation of parole does not necessarily mean the person would be required to serve all the balance of the sentence, but now consideration for release to parole on the foreshadowed orders that I have outlined will not arise until, at the earliest, 2 September 2015, and I am appreciative of the fact that the prisoner's release to parole would not necessarily follow automatically. I would hope that appropriate consideration will be given to the interests of the prisoner and the interests of the community in making that decision, particularly taking steps to ensure that the relevant mechanisms, or arrangements, are in place to deal with the fundamental problem the prisoner has which contributes to his history of offending, and that is his use of, abuse of and/or dependency upon prohibited drugs.

9The offence he committed was committed at a newsagency on King Georges Road, Wiley Park. It was committed just after 8.05 am on Tuesday 3 January 2012. I do not propose to go through the detail of the agreed facts, save to point out several matters that are relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the matter.

10The prisoner was not disguised when he entered the newsagency. The victim working in the newsagency was able to give police a description of the prisoner. When that person greeted the prisoner the prisoner produced a kitchen knife. At that point he was standing about one metre from the victim. It was said to be a knife with a blade of about 15 centimetres. The prisoner leant forward onto the counter with the knife in his right hand. The victim yelled out in Vietnamese to her husband that there was a robbery taking place and the prisoner after this moved to another position in the newsagency closer to where the victim was standing and said, ""Just give me the money, just give the money"". He pointed the knife at the victim's chest. At this point it was about 20 centimetres from the victim.

11The victim was holding a pair of scissors; she tapped the prisoner on the top of his right hand with the scissors - this was the hand holding the knife - and screamed ""I will call the police, I will call the police"". The prisoner then saw the victim's husband running from the rear of the store and he ran out of the store.

12Whilst there was the threat by the production of the knife there were no oral threats beyond those implicit in the demand for money and the presentation of the knife. This is not a case where the threat of violence is a relevant aggravating factor as it is described under s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. There is no basis for concluding beyond reasonable doubt that the use of the knife in the circumstances outlined in the fact represents a relevant aggravating factor under the relevant provision in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, bearing in mind the pleading that the prisoner used an offensive weapon to commit a crime which is, of course, the basis upon which the prisoner is to be sentenced.

13The prisoner's escape from the newsagency was ultimately unsuccessful, because he jumped into a motor vehicle the registration of which was taken down by the victim and her husband. Police were advised of the relevant details and approximately five and a half hours later the prisoner's motor vehicle was apparently observed at a BP station at Padstow, and then ultimately was sighted by police outside the Belfield TAB at about 3.15pm. The prisoner, when arrested by police very shortly thereafter, was in a ""drug affected state having red glazed eyes"". His pupils seemed ""like pinpoints and he had spittle and food stuck on his lips"". He was slurring slightly when he spoke to police. Police believe the prisoner had changed his appearance to some extent from the way he had appeared, when he had been at the newsagency, by having his hair cut. The police located on the prisoner a medium size folding lock knife in the door pocket of the motor vehicle that the prisoner was driving. It matched the description of the knife described by the victim. The prisoner was wearing clothes similar to those described by the victim.

14The prisoner gave blood and urine samples and was subsequently given time, once the LEPRA provisions were dealt with, to recover from the effects of drug. He agreed, when he could not find legal representation, to participate in an electronic interview. He gave some indication in the comments he made that he did not have a good memory of the day and some sections of the day he could not remember at all. He gave an account which included some admissions of presence in a business with a knife, but was not able to give a clear account of himself.

15The Crown does not accept the account the prisoner gave of peeling an apple and the like. Ultimately, it should be understood that the prisoner's participation in the electronic interview was voluntary, however, his recollection of relevant events was affected clearly by whatever substances he had ingested either before the robbery or subsequent to the robbery.

16One of the issues that arises from the material that has been tendered, on the basis of histories given by the prisoner, is the question of whether he was suffering from some drug-induced psychosis at the time of the commission of the offence. I note what the prisoner has said to the psychologist and the psychiatrist about this matter; I am prepared to accept as a proposition that when ingesting some prohibited drugs the prisoner will have psychotic symptoms or, have effects upon him from the drugs which give rise to psychosis or psychotic symptoms. But I am unable to conclude one way or the other whether the prisoner was in fact affected to that extent, if at all, at the time of the commission of the offence. Clearly on his arrest he was highly affected. However, his arrest occurred some seven hours after the robbery and it must be said that I read nothing in the facts, other than what might be inferred from the conduct of the prisoner, to suggest that the prisoner gave the appearance of being affected by drugs at the time of the robbery. These matters concerning voices driving him to do things and the like that arise from the histories he has given to the medical and psychological professionals were not raised by him when interviewed, as I understand the matter, later that day.

17That having been said, noting what the Crown states about not accepting his version in the electronic interview, the mere suggestion that he had a knife peeling an apple might reflect a disturbance of mind that was induced by drugs. But whether that was by reason of drugs ingested before the robbery, or not, I cannot say. 

18In relation to the commission of the offence I have noted that it was poorly planned. It was clearly an opportunistic crime. The prisoner obviously had taken some little time to choose the relevant business because he went into the business armed with a knife. It could not be categorised as a ""spontaneous"" crime, but given his history of drug dependence and abuse and his drug affected state subsequently, there can be no doubt that the prisoner chose the business, even if very shortly before, with a view to committing a robbery to obtain a money for the purposes of obtaining prohibited drugs.

19The prisoner apparently used a motor vehicle over which he had control, which was identified by the victim and that information led to the prisoner's arrest. The prisoner was a person who had not, it would seem, attempted to take any steps before the commission of the offence to prevent himself from ultimately being identified.

20The prisoner, at the time of the commission of the offence as I understand the matter, was 41 years of age. He was born on 22 December 1970. He was, as I have earlier indicated in my preliminary remarks, on parole in relation to sentences that were imposed on 5 June 2009 for offences committed by him in 2008. In fact offences, from what I understand of the statement of facts, all committed on 26 July 2008 or thereabouts. In respect of an offence of stealing from a person the prisoner was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. In respect of one offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon he was sentenced to four years imprisonment, commencing six months into the sentence for the steal from the person. In respect of another offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon he was sentenced to five years imprisonment, commencing one year into the sentence of 18 months, to which I earlier referred. He was given a concurrent sentence of six months for the offence of driving whilst disqualified. Ultimately the total sentences imposed were six years with a non-parole period of three years. Those sentences reflect the finding of special circumstances and no doubt the conclusion reached by the Court was that he needed an extended period of parole supervision to assist him in a range of ways, but, as I would understand it, particularly to assist him in relation to counselling and treatment for his drug dependency.

21His offending started a number of years ago, initially with minor driving matters with a number of appearances in the Local Court. He also in the mid-1990s had convictions for possessing prohibited drugs and low level offending associated it would seem with drug usage. However, on 8 May 1998 at the Liverpool District Court, he was convicted of armed robbery, being armed with a dangerous weapon, and given the benefit of a s 558 recognisance for a period of four years. He was dealt with in May 2000 for a breach of that recognisance and sentenced to period of two years and six months, with a non-parole period of 15 months. An application was made to appeal the inadequacy of that order to the Court of Criminal Appeal in December 2000. The Crown appeal was allowed and the initial sentence was quashed and a substituted sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal.

22On his release from parole he continued to offend, in some instances in the commission of driving and other relatively minor offences. He was convicted of possessing prohibited drugs in 2008. I neglected to point out he was also on that appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal sentenced to seven years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of four years in respect of an offence of armed robbery. 

23He had convictions in 2001 of possessing prohibited drug for which he was given a term of imprisonment that would have been served concurrently with terms of imprisonment imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. In 2006 he had other convictions, including assaulting police officers and resisting police officers in the execution of their duty. Thus it can be seen by that review of the criminal record, which I confess is somewhat disjointed because the criminal history is not given to me, as is usually the case, in any reasonable chronological order, he has regularly offended over the last 15 years, receiving substantial terms of imprisonment in relation to serious crimes.

24The commission of this offence in breach of parole is a significant aggravating factor. In fact, putting aside aggravations that arise from the pleadings and the simple facts of the case that give rise to the charge, the breach of conditional liberty in this matter is the most significant aggravating factor, as is made clear in the Crown's submissions. It is a matter of some discomfort that the prisoner was in breach of his parole it would seem within six months of being granted parole in circumstances where he still had two years and six months of his parole to serve. It may well be at some point in the future that the Parole Authority may release him to parole more hesitantly than it did on the last occasion.

25I agree with the submissions of counsel for the accused that in sentencing the prisoner in relation to the matter with which I am concerned now, it is not appropriate to conclude that his history of prior convictions is relevantly an aggravating factor. But it is a matter to be taken into account in determining the sentence in a manner that does not involve giving such weight to it as to lead to a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence.

26The criminal history of the prisoner is relevant to show that this offence is not uncharacteristic, or an uncharacteristic aberration, and it also shows that the prisoner has manifested, by the commission of this offence, a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In that situation, as was made clear by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1998] 164 CLR 465, particularly at 477-478,

""Retribution, deterrence and the protection of society may indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted in the circumstances. It is legitimate to take into account the previous criminal history of the prisoner as it illuminates the moral culpability of the prisoner"".

27Of course since Veen (No 2) the legislature has set out the statutory 'purposes of sentencing' in s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 where four of the purposes of sentencing identified by the majority of the High Court in Veen (No 2) have been incorporated into the now seven or eight purposes of sentencing identified in the legislature. In this regard as the Crown properly pointed out, there are a multitude of matters that are pertinent to the sentencing exercise; firstly, there is a need to ensure the prisoner is adequately punished for the offence, to make orders that would hopefully prevent him, and others, from committing similar offences, there is an element of need for protection of the community from the offender. It is not to say, of course, that the offender ordinarily is a danger to the community. But it is clear that when affected by drugs or when in need of money to obtain drugs, having re-established the dependence upon drugs, the prisoner has by his actions on this occasion, and his actions in the past, shown a capacity to commit serious crime, particularly armed robberies or attempted armed robberies.

28I am also required of course to promote his rehabilitation to the extent that it is possible, given the objective seriousness of the offence, and the relevant consideration of his breach of parole and his prior criminal history. I must also make him accountable, denounce his conduct and recognise the harm to the victim. Although, whilst appreciating the victim would have been greatly disturbed and frightened by the prisoner's conduct, there is no detailed evidence of particular harm that she has suffered. Her fortitude must be recognised. She admittedly was able to call for help in a language the prisoner could not understand. Although he held the knife in his hand she tapped him on the hand with the scissors to make clear to him, as I would understand it, that she was not going to give him money, that she would be calling for help and calling the police.

29It is to be fairly said that it was not a completed offence and it is fairly to be said, in the assessment of the objective facts earlier outlined, that the prisoner when challenged quickly desisted from his attempt without further use of the weapon or threats, which in one sense is to his credit. These matters can spiral out of hand and more serious offences can be committed.

30The victim has not provided a victim impact statement but, naturally, I could conclude that she was affected by the prisoner's conduct.

31Reflecting upon the subjective evidence that has been led by the prisoner, I am greatly assisted by the detail of the written submissions of counsel for the prisoner. I accept the essential matters set out in the background provided in the written submissions largely from the history provided by the prisoner to the psychiatrist and the psychologist. 

32The prisoner is a person of Greek-Australian heritage, who comes from what has been described as a traditional family. He is one of two sons, and a daughter of the marriage of his parents. His father runs a plumbing business. The prisoner on leaving school began an apprenticeship with his father in plumbing but had difficulty passing the theoretical aspects of the course and discontinued that apprenticeship. He has worked as a mechanic for some periods of time, and as a labourer. He has also worked as a plumber in custody from time to time, and also sometimes with his father over the years but his relationship with his father is a difficult one.

33Although growing up in Revesby, as is occasionally the case with Greek-Australian persons, he went back to Greece to undertake his national service with the Greek Army. He has no children. He has been in several relationships but has no permanent relationship to support him at the present time.

34He commenced using prohibited drugs when he was in his early twenties. That had an adverse effect upon him. He used amphetamines between the ages of 24 and 34, supplementing this with cocaine use. He commenced using heroin when he was approximately 27 or 28 years of age and he has had a couple of admissions to drug rehabilitation facilities, having been treated at Odyssey House for a period of time, and also undertaking a drug rehabilitation program with the Salvation Army approximately 12 years ago.

35He endeavoured to break his drug use, but people that had supplied him drugs in the past put pressure upon him to recommence his drug use and that has effectively continued as his criminal history has escalated in severity.

36He suffered head injuries in a motor vehicle accident and has some health problems. He has depressive symptoms from time to time and has undertaken self-harm on occasions. He has been treated with anti-psychotic medication in the past but had ceased taking this medication at the time of the offence. He gave a history in relation to this offence, that he had been drug free on his release to parole for a number of months and only recommenced using drugs the night before, as I understand the history, when he met a woman at a pub. Whether that is true or not is something I could not say. One, in fairness, would need to approach the history given by the prisoner in some respects with some circumspection.

37As I have said the claim of hearing voices and auditory hallucinations at the time of the offending is something that one could not conclude positively was the case, although I am prepared to accept that the use of drugs can cause those symptoms from time to time.

38Very fairly, Senior Counsel for the prisoner has reflected upon the report of the forensic psychologist, Ms Wakely, and the report of the consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Furst, which reports I have read. Ms Wakely was concerned very much with the claimed symptoms of psychosis, particularly the auditory hallucinations, and recommended the prisoner be psychiatrically examined. I appreciate of course that as a psychologist, even with extensive clinical experience, she was not able to make a medical diagnosis; that was to fall to someone with greater and better qualifications.

39She correctly points out in her summary of the matter, based upon her examination of the prisoner and the history given by the prisoner particularly in the context of his criminal history, that the substance abuse and related mental health difficulties, as well as his ""recurrent incarcerations"", were very much interrelated and contributed to the obvious instability that led to the breach of his parole. The use of drugs could exacerbate auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoia and also he might not have been assisted by abandoning medications.

40There was nothing else from her interview and assessment of the prisoner that was of a great significance, as reflected in the written submissions of senior counsel for the prisoner.

41Dr Furst came to the conclusion that the prisoner was vulnerable to psychosis, particularly as a result of abusing drugs. He reflected upon the possibility that the prisoner may have a schizophrenic illness, although reached no conclusion on that because on his examination there were few indicia of chronic mental illness. In fact, in the absence of any history of admissions for treatment or the use of appropriate medication for mental illness whilst in custody, the diagnosis of schizophrenia or chronic mental illness was not available.

42The prisoner has no developmental disability and none was found by the psychologist, and the doctor, as have I, reflected upon the absence of any claimed symptomology consistent with mental illness or even psychotic symptoms when interviewed by police.

43The doctor's opinion was that the prisoner's condition was, again relying upon the history given by the prisoner in the context of some objective evidence, one of a substance abuse disorder with previous drug induced psychosis. Issues of personality disorders were not assessed as such and other factors to be considered in the absence of major medical problems were the long term effects of the prisoner of substance abuse, probable institutionalisation, which I accept seems to be reflected in the material and, of course, the impact upon the prisoner of his current circumstances.

44In relation to the prisoner's current custodial situation Dr Furst suggested the prisoner should be placed under the care of a psychiatrist working for Justice Health to further assess his mental state and treatment needs. He may require a trial of anti-psychotic medication. He should also receive that assistance from a clinical psychologist and would benefit from drug and alcohol counselling in custody, as well as relapse prevention programs. He may need consideration for his suitability for the methadone maintenance program. Others better qualified than I are appropriate, obviously, to make that judgment, but one wonders whether the prisoner would benefit from being placed in a situation where he became dependent upon methadone.

45The doctor, as with myself, in the context of the evidence available, came to the conclusion that the prisoner's prognosis was guarded, noting his previous relapses despite treatment in rehabilitation settings. He noted the prisoner was willing to accept recommendations for further counselling and treatment. This would obviously be essential if the prisoner was to have any hope on release to desist from offending. If he remained abstinent from drugs and engaged in appropriate counselling and psychiatric treatment to address his mental health issues, his prognosis could be improved was the view of Dr Furst. He also would benefit, the doctor thought, from some period of residential rehabilitation immediately upon his release. This will be of course a matter for the Parole Authority.

46I have reflected upon the issue of the significant aggravating factor of the offences being committed whilst on conditional liberty, as reflected in s 21A(2)(j). The victim was vulnerable in the sense that she, at the time of the confrontation with the prisoner, was alone in a shop, but if it could be categorised as a relevant aggravating factor under s 21A(2) ultimately is a matter of minor significance for several reasons. One is, as it turned out, the victim's husband was at the rear of the shop and was able to come to her assistance. I know King Georges Road, Wiley Park, extremely well. I drive there frequently to get to Olympic Park and other places from my own home, and I know that at this time of the day, Monday to Friday or even Saturday and Sunday, the road is a very busy road and the shopping centre is one that is not isolated. The offence was committed at 8 o'clock in the morning, not at night. Assistance was close to hand.

47It may well be, and I cannot conclude without assistance from the prisoner on this matter, the prisoner deliberately targeted the shop, or the newsagency, because he thought the victim was alone in the shop. But this particular shopping centre is at this time of the day surrounded by motor vehicle traffic and people attending the nearby Wiley Park Railway Station and the shops that are in the vicinity.

48So far as the mitigating matters that relevantly arise out of this, ultimately I have to conclude that the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was not substantial. There was no loss and whilst, as I said earlier, I accept the victim was frightened by the prisoner, no long term injury is revealed of substance. The offence was not part of planned or organised criminal activity. 

49Clearly I cannot conclude that the prisoner is unlikely to re-offend, nor can I conclude that he has been good prospects of rehabilitation. There could not be any suggestion that he is ""at the crossroads"". Amongst other things, I have had no evidence from the prisoner and such material as comes from the prisoner comes in a hearsay form, I note the Crown's observations in that regard.

50Although the prisoner has not given evidence there is some expression of regret by the prisoner and he has pleaded early to the offence, as I have earlier noted. I am prepared to accept on balance that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and acknowledge what he has done, but having said that it is not a high level of remorse shown by the prisoner, but certainly something I am prepared to weigh in his favour.

51I note his plea of guilty and I note some assistance by his qualified admissions when he was interviewed by the police.

52As was clear in the written submissions by both Crown and the accused, the issue of the guideline judgment in Henry, albeit that it now is 14 years old, that it was handed down before the passing of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and that it was handed down before the guideline judgment on the utilitarian benefit of pleas of guilty was handed down, is of relevance here even though this is an 'attempt' offence.

53One further observation about the attempt, however, is that the reason the crime was not successful was simply because of the fortitude of the victim. The prisoner had done all that he thought he needed to do to obtain what he could from the victim. I am prepared to accept had he completed the crime, which he did not, a relatively small amount of money would have been provided to him. There is no suggestion that he was preparing to leap the counter and not only take what money was given to him but take other property from the shop.

54The guideline judgment sets out a guideline for sentencing for armed robbery in circumstances reflected in a case ""common"" for the purposes of determining a guideline at [162]of the learned Chief Justice's judgment. His Honour noted that the characteristics did not represent the full range of factors relevant to the sentencing exercise. I am mindful of the fact that a wide sentencing discretion still exists in relation to sentencing for armed robbery type of offences. That was acknowledged by the learned Chief Justice when he reflected upon Acting Chief Justice Mahony's observations in the earlier judgment of Lattouf, stating that the 'justice' of the individual case needed to be recognised. 

55I am also mindful of the additional factors that might need to be considered, set out at [170]. I am mindful of the vulnerability of the victim not being particularly great, the high level or significant level of impulsiveness and the absence of planning, the absence of any intensity of threat, the absence of any actual use of force, the fact the prisoner was alone and what I have acknowledged from the evidence available to me of the effect on the victim. 

56Then again, as I have pointed out, and which the guideline does not address directly, is the significant matter of the prisoner with a prior of record of armed robberies committing this offence whilst on parole for an armed robbery offence.

57Weighing up the various factors acknowledged by the Crown and the defence in the context of the facts as I have found them I have given close consideration to the decision of Henry. 

58I have also had regard, as I must, the observations of Wood J, then the Chief Judge at Common Law, in relation to principles that arise from sentencing an offender who is drug dependent, or commits crimes to feed a drug habit. Clearly this is not a mitigating factor. Interestingly, although I would not ascribe to Dr Furst any direct knowledge of sentencing principle, Dr Furst said in his report

""In my opinion the primary mitigating factor in his alleged offending behaviour was his substance dependence and the effects of drugs of abuse on his mental state"".

59In the written submissions of counsel for the accused it is directly acknowledged on the basis, even of the opinion of Dr Furst, that the issue of the prisoner's mental state is not one which gives rise to consideration of the principles arise in cases such as Hemsley, De La Rosa, et cetera, where a mental disability or disorder is causally linked to the commission of the offence. It was frankly acknowledged, as reflected elsewhere in Senior Counsel's submissions, as a mark of objective fairness by him, that given the history of the offence and the opinions of Dr Furst, whilst he may have been dis-inhibited and affected in his judgment by drugs, this was an impulsive act arising from his substance abuse and there was ""no indication that he was unaware of his actions or their wrongfulness"".

60That having been said however, returning to Wood J's observations, it is the case that committing a crime, particularly an armed robbery offence, motivated by need to obtain money for prohibited drugs may be taken into account as a factor relevant to the assessment of the appropriate penalty. In this case it reflects upon the impulsivity of the offence and the extent of planning, as I have already said.

61I am not able to conclude one way or the other whether the prisoner was in such a state of mind, or lacked the capacity to exercise judgment. His presentation when he was arrested, as I pointed out, was many hours after the commission of the offence and may have been caused by an intervening ingestion of prohibited drugs. I am not assisted by the prisoner with any direct evidence on this matter.

62So far as the subjective matters identified by Wood J, I certainly cannot conclude the prisoner is ""at the crossroads"", that would be completely foolish on my part. I do not believe that it has been seriously suggested that I could. The prisoner is a person who needs intensive assistance before he reaches that particular position on the road to rehabilitation.

63 The issue of the prisoner's prospects of recidivism and rehabilitation is correctly here to be regarded as a ""two edged sword"", as his Honour said. One where the prognosis in the view of the doctor and in the view of the court is guarded.

64However, the matter does excite consideration of s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the issue of ""special circumstances"". In this matter of course the prisoner at the time of sentence had his parole revoked and, as I have earlier indicated, the balance of parole at the time of the effective revocation was two years and six months. It is clear that any sentence I impose would, at the very least, be partly accumulative upon that balance of parole.

65The Crown's submission orally was that it should be almost wholly accumulative. The problem with that submission, in my view, is twofold. Firstly, I do not believe that it would give effect to an ultimate sentence that reflected the totality of the criminality in the context of sentencing practice in New South Wales. Secondly, I have already pointed out the significant aggravating factor of committing this offence whilst on parole for very similar offences. To wholly accumulate, or almost wholly accumulate this sentence upon the balance of parole would truly be to ""double-dip"", as observed by Simpson J in the decision of Callaghan ([2006] NSWCCA 58), which is referred to in the written submissions of Mr Wilson and which I am prevented from doing.

66I have had close regard to the authorities that reflect upon the appropriate approach to sentencing a person who is subject to serving a balance of parole. There are two particular cases, Callaghan, to which I referred, and DW ([2012] NSW CCA 66) which I note. Both judgments reflect upon the wide discretion that exists in these circumstances, but also the caution that needs to be exercised to ensure that there is no double counting in the effective sentence that is imposed.

67I have concluded that the terms of imprisonment that I should impose should commence one year and three months into what was two years six months and several days of balance of parole to be served. The sentence I impose will require the fixing of a non-parole period. I have concluded in the context of the authorities that relate to 'special circumstances' that the fixing of a sentence in these circumstances requires consideration of the special circumstance of the effect of partial accumulation.

68Notwithstanding the relatively early breach of parole by the prisoner and the breaches of recognisances in the past, as well as the prisoner's performance over the last 12 years, the fundamental matters that may give rise to the exercise of the discretion that exists under s 44 still exists. There is clearly a need for the prisoner to receive professional assistance to assist him not only to adjust to community living but to lead a law abiding lifestyle whilst in the community, and it is clear by his past performance that this requires very intensive direction in relation to matters of drug and alcohol, but particularly drug treatment and counselling.

69I believe the prisoner also needs assistance in relation employment and clearly assistance in relation to stable accommodation. I appreciate, of course, that he has in the past lived with this parents. But I am mindful of the difficulties in his relationship with this father particularly.

70As was pointed out by the learned Crown in the submissions made, and as I clearly understand from the law to be applied, the determination of whether there are special circumstances is one that requires the exercise of a separate discretion. One can find any number of matters that might reasonably be regarded as special circumstances but they may not necessarily excite the exercise of the discretion that is available under s 44.

71I have concluded that I should exercise the discretion available. I should also add, in this matter there is the additional issue of the prisoner's rather clouded diagnosis and prognosis in relation to mental health issues. I am not entirely convinced, even accepting everything that Dr Furst says, that there is a clear picture that has emerged. There is a possibility of an underlying mental illness or a history of psychotic reaction to the use of drugs. If the prisoner is a person prone to psychotic reactions to the use of drugs that is a matter that urgently needs addressing, because it is no consolation to the victims of crime that the person committing the crime that affects them is drug addicted let alone psychotic at the same time.

72These are matters for examination over a period of time and perhaps trial and error when it comes to appropriate medication. These are matters that not only will need to be addressed in custody but also on the prisoner's release to the community for the benefit of the prisoner and the benefit of the community and its protection.

73Be that as it may, having surveyed those matters, I have concluded that I should exercise the discretion available to make a finding of special circumstances to endeavour to recognise those matters. Of course the prisoner, given what has happened in the past, could not expect a recognition of special circumstances such as to warrant an effective non-parole period of 50 per cent of the total sentence, as occurred on the last occasion. But, in my view, a period of two years and one month in the context of the overall period the prisoner would ordinarily be required to spend in custody, is an appropriate period to provide the prisoner with the assistance that he needs.

74I have endeavoured in some detail, but also in some respects in a cursory fashion, to treat all the relevant matters that have been raised within the submissions and in the evidence in the case. Ultimately whether the prisoner is capable of not offending in the future is something that I cannot predict. I am cautious in my judgment in this matter, and certainly could not conclude, given past performance, that the possibilities of not offending in the future are great. However, again, I emphasise the need for the Parole Authority to give close consideration to the prisoner's case. I do not for a moment suggest that he should not receive encouragement from the Parole Authority in its officers, but he certainly will need very close monitoring and counselling on his release to the community, for his sake and the sake of the community that requires protection from people like the prisoner who commit crimes of this type.

75Yes thank you sir, could you just stand up thank you very much? In relation to the offence to which you have pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole of two years five months. That will commence on 3 April 2013 and it will expire on 2 September 2015. 

76In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of two years and one month, and on my calculation that sentence will expire on 2 October 2017. Whether you are released to parole will be a matter for the Parole Authority; I cannot direct your release. 

77Your earliest release date will be 2 September 2015. I will not fix any conditions for your parole, the Parole Authority and its officers will be far better positioned to do that than I will at the appropriate time. Just take a seat thanks very much.

78Any other matters Mr Crown?

79HEARN: No there's not.

80HIS HONOUR: Any other matters Mr Murnane?

81MURNANE: No your Honour.

82HIS HONOUR: Right. Do you understand the sentence I have imposed?

83ACCUSED: Not really your Honour.

84HIS HONOUR: Well your non-parole period will expire on 2 September 2015, which is a bit less than three years from now. I have extended the sentence that you would have otherwise been required if you were required to serve the entirety of the balance of parole by approximately a year and three or four months I think. Maybe two months. The balance of sentence, the period of time which you will be subject to parole as a maximum period will be two years and one month.

85ACCUSED: Thank you your Honour.

86HIS HONOUR: Yes thank you Mr Alexandrou, you can go with the officers thank you.

87ACCUSED: ..(not transcribable).. apologise to the victim again--

88HIS HONOUR: Yes thank you.

89ACCUSED: --for my behaviour.

90HIS HONOUR: I've noted what you said from the dock.

91ACCUSED: Basically the way I see it your Honour is I'm a victim too because I fell on drugs. The real people are still out there selling drugs and I've never done that in my life sold drugs. I've never--

92HIS HONOUR: Well Mr Alexandrou if you wanted to help the community and stop people using drugs, and stop people selling drugs, all you've got to do is contact the police and give the police the name of every person whose ever supplied you with drugs.

2418460,R v Milton [2012] NSWDC 310,"Judgment


1HIS HONOUR: When Jackson Milton first appeared before me some time ago now, he was living in a residential rehabilitation facility and making progress towards putting his abuse of drugs behind him. With the consent of the Crown, the matter was adjourned under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, to allow Mr Milton to demonstrate rather than just promise, rehabilitation. When the matter came back before me today, Mr Milton had done what was expected of him. There is no suggestion that he is using drugs. He has fulltime work. He has not committed any further offences and he continues to engage with rehabilitation programs. In short, he has done what was expected of him. He has demonstrated rehabilitation rather than just promise it.

2Of course, the most fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society. Usually that is done by imposing harsh sentences, where appropriate, in order that both individual offenders, and others who might be tempted to break the law, will be deterred from committing criminal offences. But on occasions, and this is one, the protection of society is best achieved by a sentence which promotes rehabilitation rather than punishment.

3Of course, this is not at all to ignore the significant offences which Mr Milton committed. Whilst under the influence of drugs and after being appropriately refused more money by his parents, he went wandering the streets in order to find some way of obtaining some more money to buy more drugs. He came across a residence where a door was left ajar. He pushed it open and went inside. There were people sleeping inside at the time, a couple and their three children.

4The man of the house woke up and went downstairs in the early hours of the morning. He saw the offender in his kitchen and said, eloquently, ""what the fuck are you doing?"" When Mr Milton started to walk off, Mr McDonald grabbed him and held him to the ground. He said at one stage, ""why did you break in"", and Mr Milton accurately replied, ""I am a heroin addict"". Mr McDonald asked Mr Milton to show him what he had got and what he had taken, and so Mr Milton took Mr McDonald to the back veranda of the home where Mr McDonald saw a significant amount of his property awaiting transport away from the home.

5The police arrived soon afterwards and Mr Milton was taken into custody. Fortunately, it would seem, that the property was all recovered. He then spent some three months in gaol before being released on bail. He then spent a further period of quasi custody at the residential rehabilitation facility, and on top of that, was reporting daily for a period of about five months. So to that extent, Mr Milton has already been punished for what he has done, but it is accepted that further punishment is required to reflect the objective gravity of what he did.

6It is a frightening and serious experience for a householder to find that the security of their property has been invaded by a person who really thinks little about their legitimate rights and is only concerned with getting money to buy drugs. What the offender did was seriously wrong and there does need to be further punishment.

7The offender's problems with the law all relate to his problems with drugs. He has, in the past, been able to spend some years drug free, and when he was doing that he was able to work well and live a productive life. Indeed, at one stage, as was noted on the first occasion that Mr Milton appeared before me, he acted very bravely in apprehending a violent offender and received an award from the State government. He is entitled to be proud of his actions on that occasion but he is also entitled to be proud because of what he has achieved of recent times. Giving up drugs is hard work but Mr Milton, with the loving support of his parents who have stood by him over many heartbreaking years, is to be commended.

8His offending came at a time of a downward spiral, at least partly due to his relationship with a young woman who was also a drug user, but he has been able to put such experiences behind him - give up drugs and give up crime. It is to be hoped that this is the last time that Mr Milton does appear before the courts for a criminal matter.

9Anyone looking at the sentences that I am shortly to announce, must remember that they come on top of the custody, quasi custody and daily reporting that I mentioned earlier. I should also mention that the offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. I will not quantify the discount that I have allowed for those pleas of guilty but will say that the pleas of guilty are amongst the matters that I have taken into account in deciding to impose a different form of sentence from that I would ordinarily have imposed. In particular, it has led me to decide to impose a non-custodial sentence on Mr Milton.

10He is remorseful for what he has done. He recognises, I think, the harm that he has done over the years, not only to the victims of his crime but also to his family. He has caused them trouble and it is a great credit to him that they have stood by him and are in court today, as they have been on every other occasion.

11For the offence of stealing from a dwelling, the offender is convicted and ordered to perform 100 hours community service.

12For the offence of aggravated enter a dwelling with intent to steal, the offender is convicted and ordered to perform 200 hours community service.

13Those periods of community service are to be performed cumulatively, making a total therefore of 300 hours community service.

14The offender is to report to the City District Office of the Probation and Parole Service within seven days in order to commence serving his community service.

15HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Milton, you have done community service in the past, so you know what is involved. The only thing I really want to tell you is that if you do not do it, then Corrective Services let me know and you will come back before me, and I can tell you I will be very disappointed if I see you and you will be the person that suffers because of my disappointment. You will actually, probably be worse off then if I just had not given you this opportunity. Do you understand that? Can I put it bluntly. You will probably go to gaol if you do not do your community service so bear that in mind if you ever face any temptations in the future.

		20 August 2014",2012-12-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2418463,R v AM [2012] NSWSC 1635,"SENTENCE

1The offender, AM, pleaded guilty on 30 August 2012 to one count of affray committed on 25 June 2009. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.

2On the day of the offence, eleven young men gathered in a car park at Milperra to settle a dispute between two opposing groups. The tragic consequences of that evening have already been the subject of sentences imposed upon this offender's older brother, MM (see R v Mariam [2012] NSWSC 1023). This offender stands to be sentenced on the basis of an agreed statement of facts that does not attribute to him any knowledge of the presence of firearms at the scene.

3There are obvious considerations of parity at play, given the sentencing of a number of co-offenders for their part in the same affray, in particular this offender's older brother MM. I have previously commented on the absence of any upward movement in relation to the range of sentences imposed for affray since the maximum penalty was doubled as and from 15 December 2005 ; R v Abdulhardi NSWSC 20 April 2012.

The Offence

4At about 9pm on 25 June 2009, HEK was involved in a physical assault with Samir Mohamad at Bankstown's Centro shopping centre. This offender was also present. The assault was interrupted by security staff and by police. Both groups were escorted from the premises. HEK was the instigator of the conflict by referring to Samir Mohamad as a ""dog"".

5Over the following hour, numerous telephone calls were made between associates and family members of the two opposing camps, namely the offender's group and the El Kobaili group, as well as between members belonging to each group. During these telephone calls, arrangements were made to meet in order to pursue the earlier conflict. This offender called members of the El Kobaili group and his two older brothers,  resulting in this offender being picked up by M outside the address of Samir Mohamed at Padstow in a green Honda two door coupe. This offender and M spoke with Samir Mohamed and Ibrahim Mohamed about the earlier incident and dispute with HEK at Bankstown. 

6At about 10:29pm, three members of the Mariam group, MM, Tarek Elbadar and Rami Abdulhardi, travelled to the vicinity of the car park in a Mazda. They parked near a roundabout on Starkey Drive and walked from the vehicle into the car park adjacent to a Hungry Jack's food outlet. The trio was seen by a number of employees of that outlet. They changed direction and walked towards the Aldi store on the northern edge of the car park. They remained in view of the Hungry Jack's employees until those employees left the parking lot shortly thereafter.

7At about 10:34pm, the Honda car driven by M with this offender as passenger, pulled into the car park and parked between KFC and Hungry Jack's. They remained in the car.

8A short time later, a white van carrying the El Kobaili group entered the car park and parked alongside the Honda. At this point in time, the high beam of the Honda was activated, whereupon some members of the Mariam group started walking towards the white van.

9Almost immediately,  MM who was advancing from the direction of the Aldi store perimeter, began shooting at the El Kobaili group.  One of the occupants of the van returned fire.
 
10HEK and another occupant left the white van while its engine was still running and ran to the Honda. HEK started fighting with M. This offender locked the passenger door as soon as he was approached. Other occupants from the van began attacking the Honda with a large piece of wood and a steel wrench. 

11One of the bullets fired by MM in the car park struck a truck driver, Mr Knight, who was travelling on Milperra road, resulting in his immediate death.

12Mr Abdulhardi received serious gunshot wounds to the abdomen. M received gunshot wounds to the right forearm as he was standing outside the Honda. At some point, this offender left the vehicle and ran from the scene.

13Within minutes of these events, the El Kobaili group retreated to the van and left the car park. This offender went to Bankstown Hospital, together with M, in a vehicle driven by Tarek Elbadar. Meanwhile, MM drove from the scene in the Honda at high speed, pursued by police, and was ultimately arrested in the front yard of his home. The Ruger semiautomatic pistol used by MM was recovered by police from the side of the road between the car park and his home. The magazine was empty. Eight spent cartridges and two live rounds from the Ruger were found within the car park.

14In addition, there were four spent rounds from another .22 calibre weapon, a rifle, and one further unfired cartridge from the same weapon recovered from the car park.

15The offender's role in these events consisted of communicating with HEK for the purposes of arranging the meeting and enlisting the help of his older brothers. There is no reliable evidence capable of establishing what it was that the offender anticipated would happen. The offender gave an account to Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist on 15 October 2012, in which the offender claimed that he was acting as a peacemaker at the shopping centre, that he rang HEK but has no memory of how he came to have his telephone number or what was said between them, and that he had no intention that the violence between the two groups would escalate, rather that he thought he was going to stop everything and ""it just went out of hand"".

16A similar account was given to the Juvenile Justice officer who interviewed the offender on 22 November and 3 December 2012. To the Juvenile Justice officer, the offender claimed that he does not now recall how his brothers became involved. He said that he was unsure what to expect when the meeting was planned but that he thought it would be an opportunity to resolve the issue. The offender acknowledged that an altercation may occur but denied that he anticipated how serious it would become.

17These accounts are untested by cross-examination. I am sceptical of the offender's claimed lack of recollection surrounding the circumstances leading up to the meeting in the car park. However, I accept that the offender was appalled at the escalation in the violence once they arrived at the scene. Nonetheless, the invitation to his older brothers is strongly suggestive of a realisation on the offender's part that he needed additional physical and moral support to assert the will of his associates over that of the El Kobailis.

The Objective Gravity of the Offence

18I have previously considered the extent to which the Court could have regard to the fact that the discharge of firearms resulted in the death of an innocent bystander in assessing the gravity of the offence. I repeat what I have previously said on this issue for the purposes of sentencing this offender. 

19Most relevantly, in Stevens v R [2007] NSWCCA 152, Price J (McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreeing) said at [25] to [27] :-
In determining an appropriate sentence for an offence of affray contrary to section 93C of the Crimes Act an offender's conduct is to be considered in the context of the conduct of a co-offender. The level of violence used in the scale of the affray is relevant. An offender however, may only be sentenced for that part of his conduct and the conduct of the co-offender which give rise to the offence of affray and not that conduct which resulted in some other offence being committed by him or by the co-offender; see R v Huynh [2000] NSWCCA 18; R v Eleter [2003] NSWCCA 130 and R v Fajka [2004] NSWCCA 166.
His Honour found as I have mentioned that the applicant and Davis were the aggressors. Furthermore it was open to the judge to find that they had attacked both victims with extreme violence. The attack by Davies upon Mrs Herring with a tyre lever was part of the co-offender's conduct which gave rise to the offence of affray. In my view, the nature and extent of the physical violence was an objective factor relevant to the seriousness of the offence.

20Most recently in Khanwaiz & Ors v R [2012] NSWCCA 168 , Beech-Jones J said (Basten JA and Harrison J agreeing) :-

50. Further the significance of the distinct element of the affray charge, namely the effect of the attack upon persons at the scene, cannot be understated. Offences such as s 93C have a wider focus that just the impact on the direct victim of the unlawful violence. Section 93C is located within Part 3A of the Crimes Act which deals with public order. Attacks of the kind participated in by Noman can undermine the public's confidence in the security of their streets and homes. His Honour recognised this is in the sentencing judgment when referring to the ""separate policy considerations effectively requiring separate assessments of the criminality and issues of accumulation"" with the affray offences.

21It is axiomatic that in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the offender for the affray, he is not to be punished for the manslaughter of Mr Knight. He stands to be sentenced on the basis of his individual role in the commission of the affray. That, however, does not preclude the Court from taking into account, for the purposes of assessing the objective gravity of the offence, the fact that the discharge of loaded firearms was a feature of the affray. That feature of the offence demonstrated the extent to which members of the public were put in fear for their personal safety.

22To the extent that the gravity of the offence is affected by its short duration and the fact that it occurred late at night, after the various retail outlets on the perimeter of the car park had closed, those factors are of some, albeit, limited significance. The relatively short period of time during which the affray took place, in the order of minutes, was no doubt the product of the repeated discharge of at least two firearms and the wounding that resulted to two of the Mariam group. The participants in the affray were in exposed positions in the car park. The longer they remained there, the more likely it was that they themselves would be injured. Notwithstanding that the fast food outlets were no longer trading, there were members of the staff of those outlets who were waiting in the car park to be collected by friends and relatives. Moreover, adjacent to the car park, there was a service station and 711 store which was, at the time of the affray, trading with members of the public. All of these people were potentially put at risk of serious injury. That risk materialised in the death of Mr Knight.

23The offence demonstrated a measure of planning and premeditation, the participants were variously armed with firearms, pieces of timber and other implements, it was a large group, it occurred in full view of numerous members of the public in a public car park and it involved the actual use of violence. These are all factors that are relevant to an assessment of objective gravity.

24In the result, it is not necessary to embrace the Crown's description of the offence as one approaching the worst case. It is always possible to envisage circumstances that would render the offence more objectively serious, although that does not preclude a finding that an offence is in the worst case category. This affray did not take place at a time or in a place that engendered in a large number of members of the public fear for their personal safety. That does not detract from my assessment of the offence as objectively a particularly serious example of affray.

25For these reasons I have determined that the offender must be dealt with at law. That said, his role in the events at the carpark was extremely limited. He was not involved in the infliction of any violence and he did not engage with anyone once the affray started. I accept that he attempted to withdraw by locking the door of the car, although that act of self preservation was not surprising given the size and bulk of the man who was immediately threatening him. 

26The offender was only 15 years of age at the time of the offence. There is some merit in the submission of the offender's counsel to the effect that the offender's older brothers demonstrated a complete failure of moral and filial duty towards the offender. He has no criminal history and stands to be sentenced as a person of otherwise good character.

27Whilst general deterrence has a role to play in the sentencing exercise, specific deterrence is of negligible consideration. Given his personal circumstances and the effect which his involvement in the events of that night have had upon him, I regard his prospects of rehabilitation as sound.

Subjective Circumstances.

28The offender is presently 19 years of age, the youngest of five brothers. The offender continues to reside with his parents in the family home. He is the only child of the marriage who remains at home. The offender is described by his mother as a well-behaved and compliant child who has maintained positive behaviour throughout his adolescence.

29The offender has completed his secondary schooling to HSC standard. He left school in August 2010 following a period in custody before he was granted bail. Reports that were obtained from the offender's high school indicated that the offender did not apply himself academically and did not achieve his potential.

30The offender apparently commenced working full time as a carpenter and continued to work casually in that capacity throughout 2011. Contact with the offender's employer by Juvenile Justice did not produce any confirmation of the duration of full-time employment and the date upon which that ceased.

31At the beginning of 2012, the offender began to work full-time for his father in his father's spray painting business where he continues to be employed. The offender has started an apprenticeship in automotive spray painting and is currently completing this apprenticeship through Granville TAFE. The offender's father reports that the offender is hard-working and conscientious.

32The offender has reportedly ceased contact with many of the peer group that he had at the time of the offence. In large measure this was due in part to the conditions of his bail. Somewhat surprisingly, the offender reported that he has not been exposed to antisocial or criminal behaviour by his older siblings. That statement appears to overlook the central role that his oldest brother MM had in the events in the car park.

33The offender displays a disturbing lack of insight in respect of his brothers' involvement in the offence. The Juvenile Justice report notes that the offender ""may be minimising his offending behaviour by his vague recollection of the circumstances surrounding the offence and statements purporting his involvement occurred as a result of his young age and lack of common sense at the time."" On the positive side, the offender recognises that he made a poor decision to participate in the offence and that he reacted impulsively with little thought for the consequences of his actions.

34The offender has reported to others, including his immediate family and the Juvenile Justice officer, that he feels regret for the deceased victim and for members of his family. It is said that the incident has affected him greatly and that he has developed into a reserved and anxious young man. Given the offender's reluctance to take responsibility for his part in the offence, it is difficult to gauge whether this regret constitutes genuine remorse in the absence of hearing and seeing the offender express it to the Court.

35The offender spent the period between 21 April and 18 August 2010 in custody for the instant offence.

36The offender offered to plead guilty to affray in full discharge of the indictment when the matter was still in the Parramatta Children's Court. This offer was rejected by the Crown. Accordingly, the offender is entitled to a 25% discount on the sentence that is otherwise appropriate to the offence.

37The law in relation to the sentencing of juvenile offenders is well settled and does not need to be repeated. The principles that inform the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act recognise that the relative immaturity and vulnerability of juvenile offenders potentially renders them inappropriate vehicles for general deterrence, with a correspondingly greater emphasis on rehabilitation.

38In terms of parity, this offender is one of the least culpable of all of the participants in the affray. Unlike SE, this offender was not armed and unlike HE, he was not aware of the existence of firearms in any of the vehicles. 

39Taking into account the period of almost 4 months in custody on this offence, the offender's strong subjective case, his limited role in the affray itself and his youth at the time of the commission of the offence, I do not regard a sentence of imprisonment as the requisite penalty.

40AM, you are convicted of the offence of affray. I direct that you enter a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be of good behaviour for a period of three years to date from today.

		05 March 2013",2012-12-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2418611,R v Aldred [2013] NSWDC 13,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: The offender Jason Aldred drove in a way which caused the death of Ms Simpson-Langley only one week after being released to bail for an offence of driving under the influence. It was a condition of that bail that he did not drive. He clearly ignored that condition with tragic results. It is a seriously aggravating feature of the present matter that, having been granted bail for an offence of driving under the influence, the offender would ignore the conditions under which he was granted his liberty, thereby leading to the death of a young woman.

2The Crown tendered today the police facts in relation to the offender's conduct on 8 June 2011. Often in an enthusiasm of hyperbole such facts record that a particular driver was ""an accident waiting to happen."" Unfortunately in this case these tragic events have demonstrated the accuracy of that characterisation of the offender by the police. 

3After the offender was granted bail he was admitted into a rehabilitation facility at Benelong's Haven. He went there with his girlfriend Ms Simpson-Langley. He had with him some prescription drugs and he must have taken them at some stage although he denies that he had taken any medication, either legal or illegal, immediately preceding the collision that I will shortly describe. 

4After being at Benelong's Haven for only a short time he was asked to leave by those in control, and he did so. He spent some nights in Kempsey either on the streets or in a hotel with Ms Simpson-Langley but decided to return to Newcastle where his grandmother lived. To do this he drove.

5On the morning of Monday 18 July 2011 he stole a car. He said that that was because he and Ms Simpson-Langley were to sleep in the car that night, having nowhere else to sleep. But whether that was the original motivation or not, it did not take long before they used the car as a mode of transport rather than a place of accommodation. They headed south from Kempsey heading towards Newcastle. Eventually, with the offender driving, the car left the roadway, hit a tree and Ms Simpson-Langley was killed.

6It is important to note that the location of the collision was nowhere near any reasonable route from Kempsey to Newcastle. It is apparent that the offender has driven, for reasons which I will partially explore in a little while, inland, probably after going across the Hexham bridge. He travelled inland, most likely even reaching Cessnock, before turning around and heading back eastwards along John Renshaw Drive. 

7Travelling behind him was a gentleman by the name of Mr Anthony Maher. He watched the offender's manner of driving for a significant period of time. Although it seems that the offender was not driving at excessive speed, he was, and this is not an expression that Mr Maher used, driving all over the place, veering to the left and the right, on occasions leaving the roadway before correcting himself. Mr Maher was so concerned by what he saw that he slowed down to increase the gap between the offender's vehicle and his own. 

8He describes the moment of collision this way: 

""I watched as the Holden in front of me swayed to the left again. The passenger side tyres were off the road and were travelling along the tarred area on the edge of the roadway. It looked like the car was about to hit one of the white reflective posts on the side of the road. The car then swung to the right across the centre lines and onto the wrong side of the road. The entire car crossed over onto the wrong side of the road and the car travelled ahead there for two or three of those guideposts. The car then suddenly swung to the left and crossed back across the centrelines and straight across the lane I was travelling in. It looked like a sharp turn like the driver swung the wheel. He was heading straight for the trees off the side of the road to my left. The car drove off the side of the road at fair speed.""

9It is apparent that the offender was, to use a neutral expression at this stage, fatigued. It is apparent that his manner of driving as observed by Mr Maher was related to that fatigue. Whether that came about because of mere tiredness or, as the crown case would suggest, because of drugs that the offender had taken shortly before the collision is an issue which should not be elevated beyond its proper place in assessing the culpability of the offender. Whatever the situation, it is clear that for some time the offender continued to drive despite an awareness that he was having trouble keeping his car on the roadway, this amounting to an awareness, of course, that he was a danger to be on the road. But because a great deal of attention has been paid to the issue during the course of today's proceedings, I will address the issue as to why the offender was fatigued.

10I am satisfied, and satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that this was because he had consumed drugs only shortly before the collision. I am prepared to accept as a reasonable possibility that the offender's denial of having done so flows from a problem with his memory rather than a problem with his honesty. But I repeat, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a contributing factor to the collision, because it was a contributing factor to the offender's fatigue, is that he had consumed drugs only shortly before the collision.

11A number of factors point in that direction. Blood analysis was done after the offender was taken to hospital. The statement of facts records the opinion of Dr Perl. She notes that the offender's blood contained clonazepam which is sold under the brand name Rivotril, and methadone. The statement of facts records Dr Perl's opinion as to the effects that those drugs have on human beings but, importantly for the present issue, she says this:

""The blood concentration of clonazepam detected in the accused indicates a recent high dose of clonazepam having been used.""

Of course, there was no precise understanding of what the word ""recent"" meant but other factors suggest that the offender must have taken those drugs well after he commenced the drive south from Kempsey.

12Another factor important to take into account is where the collision occurred. As I have attempted to make clear, the offender was nowhere near any reasonable route from Kempsey to Newcastle. Perhaps he consumed the drugs before reaching the Hexham bridge and he got lost or deviated from the correct route to Newcastle because of confusion resulting from the consumption of drugs. Perhaps he deliberately went to Cessnock or Kurri for reasons that he does not want to tell us about or cannot remember. Perhaps those reasons relate to the purchase of drugs.

13Next we have the offender's behaviour after the collision. Of course, one possible explanation could be that it could be the injuries that the offender had suffered in the collision itself, but in assessing that possibility it is important to remember that after Narcan was administered to the offender his behaviour changed and significantly so. Mr Fitzgerald, who appears for Mr Aldred, did not make a submission to me that I could find that the offender's evidence that he had not taken drugs shortly before the collision was accurate. 

14The result is that the offender was on notice that he was a danger on the road, for two reasons. Firstly, the way he drove as observed by Mr Maher and, secondly, because he himself knew that he had taken drugs only shortly before the collision. Either of those matters indicates a significant level of moral culpability but when they are combined I am satisfied that the moral culpability displayed by the offender is high indeed. This is not a case of mere momentary inattention; far from it. 

15The offender has experienced other tragedy in his life. He was the second son to his parents but his father died when the offender was only seven from a heart attack. The family moved from Melbourne, where they were living, to Newcastle to be near his mother's grandparents. His mother died also, in 2003. As might be expected, the loss of both parents in those circumstances has had a significant effect on the offender's mental state. He is, of course, concerned that when his maternal grandmother dies, she is now aged eighty-five, he will be left with no close relatives or family ties. 

16There is some hope, however, for the future in that regard. To their great credit, the offender's Godfather and his wife, Mr and Mrs Dennis, have offered to take Mr Aldred in on his release from gaol. The evidence was that they are firmly against any use of drugs, and so there is some hope for the offender's future should he take advantage of Mr and Mrs Dennis' generous and loving offer.

17The offender has not worked much in the past. Most of his jobs have lasted only weeks or months and he has not had any employment as an adult. Part, no doubt, of the offender's problems in getting and keeping a job result from his drug use, which in turn is quite likely to have a connection with the loss of the offender's parents. 

18The offender began to use cannabis at about the age of thirteen and commenced to use heroin when he was about twenty-one. To no one's surprise, he became addicted to that drug. He has used other drugs as well including amphetamines. He has also been prescribed drugs which have caused problems for him. He has attempted rehabilitation in the past but nothing has been terribly successful. 

19The offender has a criminal history. Indeed, he is currently serving sentences for other offences, including the driving under the influence matter, as I speak today. His driving offences too are of most concern. He displays a continuing attitude of disobedience towards the road rules. He drives regularly whilst he is not licensed to do so. He is currently a disqualified driver. It goes without saying that if the offender had obeyed the road rules, the tragic events that I have been describing would not have occurred. 

20The offender entered a plea of guilty at first arraignment in the District Court. That, of course, is not a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity but close to it. I will discount the sentence I would otherwise impose by 20 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea.

21That plea is also some evidence of remorse. I accept that the offender is remorseful. I accept that he himself has experienced deeply the loss of the person he described as his life partner. It has to be said that remorse in cases of this kind is almost invariably present. Few people can remain unaffected by having caused the death of another when they did not mean to do so. 

22The offender would be assisted by an extended period of supervision on parole. These sentences, because the offender must be sentenced for two matters, are also to be imposed cumulatively on the offender's existing sentences. Both of those factors suggest the desirability of a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. 

23The principle of totality also applies, but it remains the case that the offender must be punished, and significantly so, for what he has done. The sentences I impose must reflect the objective gravity of the offender's conduct and, as I have tried to make clear, I regard his criminality as significant. 

24To summarise, he took drugs which he well knew would affect his ability to drive only shortly before the collision. He continued to drive, despite his manner of driving which must have alerted him to the danger that he represented. That is criminality of a significant order. There needs to be a substantial component of specific deterrence built into any sentence imposed upon the offender. He has thumbed his nose at the road rules in the past. It must be brought home to him that he cannot continue to do that in the future without experiencing punishment of a high order. 

25I sentence the offender as follows. For the offence of stealing a motor vehicle, which is count 2 on the indictment, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of imprisonment of eighteen months to date from 27 April 2013. I take into account the matter on the form 1 of driving whilst disqualified. 

26For the offence of driving in a manner dangerous occasioning death the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years to commence from 27 April 2014 and a head sentence of four and a half years. The overall non-parole period is thus one of three years with a head sentence of five and a half years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 26 April 2016. The offender is disqualified from driving for a period of five years from 17 May 2015..

2418843,Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50,"Judgment

1McCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree with Button J.

2BELLEW J: I agree with Button J.

3BUTTON J: On 20 May 2011 in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney, her Honour Judge Ashford sentenced the applicant for a large number of offences. They were all of a sexual nature, and had been committed against three young girls. Two of them were the stepdaughters of the applicant, and one of them was the daughter of his cousin. The offences had been committed more than 25 years before the date of sentence. The applicant had defended three separate trials that led to the convictions.

4I shall provide details of the offences and their sentences in a moment. It suffices to say at this stage that her Honour imposed a total head sentence of imprisonment for 19 years with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 13 years. Clearly, special circumstances were found upon which a small variation in the statutory ratio was based. If that had not been the case, the total non-parole period would have been imprisonment for 14 years and 3 months.

Offences and objective features

5The applicant was sentenced for 12 sexual offences against his stepdaughter KB, who was born in August 1969. He was sentenced for nine sexual offences against his stepdaughter LM, who was born in September 1972. And he was sentenced for four sexual offences against his relative JM, who was born in August 1967. Because of the multiplicity of offences, it is convenient to use a table to describe the offence, the offence creating provision, the applicable maximum penalty, the date of the offence, the age of the victim at the time of the offence, and any other noteworthy aspect. At the end of each table, a short summary of the objective features of each offence is provided. Again, due to the multiplicity of offences, that summary will be brief. 

6All of the data is derived from the remarks on sentence. Neither party to the appeal submitted that her Honour had made any error with regard to the material that underpins the following analysis.

7The objective features of the offences involving KB were as follows. With regard to count one, the applicant approached KB whilst she was in her bedroom and touched the outside of her vagina for more than a few minutes. This occurred in the family home of the applicant and KB. 

8Counts two, three, four, five and six were committed as part of the same event at the family home in the master bedroom. In respect of count two, the applicant touched the outside of KB's vagina with his fingers whilst she was lying down on the bed. Count three was a continuation of count two: the applicant touched the inside of KB's vagina without her consent. With regard to count four, the applicant licked, without consent, KB's vagina as he was touching her with his fingers. With regard to count five the applicant rubbed his penis on the outside of KB's vagina. Count six reflected that the applicant asked KB to lick his penis and encompassed an attempt to place his penis in KB's mouth. (The applicant was acquitted on count seven.)

9The criminality of count eight occurred on a separate occasion in the same family home. The applicant touched and licked KB's vagina, and then moved her onto a bed where he rubbed his penis on the outside of her vagina for a few minutes. The applicant ejaculated on KB's stomach. 

10Counts nine, ten, eleven and twelve were all committed as part of the same event, again on a separate occasion but in the same home. Count nine was founded on an act of touching the outside of KB's vagina. Count ten reflected that the applicant moved his penis to the opening of KB's vagina. Count eleven reflected an act of cunnilingus upon KB. Count twelve reflected the applicant rubbing his penis against the outside of KB's vagina. 

11Count thirteen occurred on a separate occasion in the family home. The applicant inserted his penis into KB's vagina without her consent. The applicant held KB down on the bed by her shoulder. After the event, KB was able to escape and run to the bathroom.

13The objective features of the offences involving LM are as follows. Count one reflected that the applicant entered the bedroom of LM and placed his hand under the blanket to touch the outside of LM's vagina for a few minutes. This offence occurred in the family home of the applicant and LM. 

14Count two reflected that, on a separate occasion in the family home, the applicant again entered the bedroom of LM and touched her vagina with his fingers. 

15Count three occurred as part of a separate incident. In the master bedroom of the family home, the applicant took LM's hand and made her touch his penis. 

16Regarding count four, the applicant was in LM's bedroom at the family home, and he licked her genitals without her consent. (The applicant was acquitted on count five).

17As for count six, the applicant placed LM's hand on his penis and made her stroke it until he ejaculated. This offence also occurred in the family home. 

18Counts seven and nine occurred as part of the same event. (The applicant was acquitted on count eight.) Count seven reflected the fact that the applicant told LM to ""lick his penis like a lollypop"" and LM reluctantly did so. During the course of count seven, the applicant pushed LM's head down on his penis and caused LM to gag. As for count nine, the applicant stroked his penis until he ejaculated, after which he told LM to taste his semen. LM again reluctantly did so. This series of offences also occurred in the family home, however it is not clear whether it was a separate occasion to count six. 

19The offence in count ten occurred on a separate occasion on a boat that the applicant was minding at the time. The applicant touched LM's vagina with his hand. 

20Count eleven reflected that, on an occasion when LM was home alone with the applicant, the applicant, whilst stroking his penis, asked LM if he could put his penis in LM's vagina. She refused and walked away from him.

22The objective features of the offences involving JM are as follows. Counts one, two and three occurred as part of the same event when JM was visiting the applicant at his home. With regard to count one, the applicant entered the room of JM and JM's sister, removed his penis from his trousers, and asked them if they wanted to play with it. Count two asserted that the applicant then took JM's sister from the room, returned to the room where JM was located, pulled aside her underwear and placed his little finger into JM's vagina. JM felt a burning sensation and requested that the applicant stop. He did not do so. Count three reflected that the applicant then penetrated JM's vagina with his penis ""a short distance"", causing JM pain and fear. 

23Count four occurred on a separate occasion, in the confines of a motor vehicle. The applicant removed his penis from his trousers and ordered JM to suck it. The applicant then proceeded to place his penis in her mouth for a short period of time.

24To complete the picture with regard to the objective features of the offences, a victim impact statement from each victim was received by her Honour. Of course, each of the victims was a grown woman by the time of the preparation of that document. There is no need to detail those statements; it suffices to say that the offences of the applicant have had very deleterious effects on the psychological wellbeing of each of the victims, and that those effects have caused decades of suffering.

Subjective features

25Despite the three trials, by the time of sentence the applicant had expressed remorse about the crimes he had committed against his stepdaughters, though not about those against his relative.

26The applicant was born in 1946. He was aged 64 years when he stood for sentence, and had been aged from 30 to 38 years when he committed the offences.

27The applicant had not been convicted of any offences committed after the last one under consideration. Accordingly, her Honour dealt with him on the basis that he had been a person of good character for almost 27 years.

28However, it is noteworthy that, in 1971, the applicant had been dealt with for indecently assaulting a male, and for assaulting a female under the age of 16 years with an act of indecency. He was sentenced in the Penrith Court of Quarter Sessions, and received a good behaviour bond for 3 years for each offence. 

29Evidence from two psychiatrists revealed some important features. The first was that the applicant gave a history of having been sexually assaulted as a child by two separate men. Although her Honour did not explicitly accept that history, she recounted it without demurrer in the remarks on sentence. One of the psychiatrists expressed the opinion that those events could have played a role in the commission of the offences by the applicant.

30The second important feature was that, during a lengthy career in the Navy, the applicant had been on military service in Vietnam and Indonesia. He had undertaken some extremely dangerous work, such as underwater explosive disposal. Over the years he had developed a serious problem with anxiety and thereafter depression. That in turn led to self-medication with alcohol. His abuse of alcohol escalated to the point of the applicant needing to consume a bottle of sherry for breakfast. To his credit, he had sought help, and had been admitted to two facilities on more than one occasion for treatment for alcohol dependence and post-traumatic stress disorder. At the time of sentencing, the applicant was being treated with antidepressants.

31The third important feature was that, despite the denial of the applicant that he had a sexual attraction to children, one of the psychiatrists diagnosed him with a ""disorder of sexual arousal consistent with paedophilia"".

32Her Honour noted the willingness of the applicant to seek help, both in the past and in the future, and assessed his prospects of rehabilitation as good.

Sentences imposed

33Again, in light of the number of offences, it is convenient to explain the sentences imposed by way of three tables. Each table will show the count number, the head sentence and non-parole period, the commencement date, and any other noteworthy aspect.

34Furthermore, annexed to this judgement is a diagram that seeks to explain the complete structure of the sentences imposed upon the applicant in a readily comprehensible form. It should be noted that, due to the multiplicity of counts, that diagram extends over three pages.

35In overview, for the 12 offences committed against KB, the applicant received a total head sentence of 8 years with a total non-parole period of 4 years.

36For the 9 offences committed against LM, the applicant received a total head sentence of 6 years with a total non-parole period of 3 years.

37For the 4 offences committed against JM, the applicant received a total had sentence of 12 years with a total non-parole period of 6 years.

38The total non-parole period for the offences committed against JM is wholly cumulative upon the total non-parole period for the offences committed against LM, which in turn is wholly cumulative upon the total non-parole period for the offences committed against KB.

39As I have indicated, the overarching sentence imposed upon the applicant by her Honour was a total head sentence of 19 years with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 13 years

Grounds of appeal

40Eleven grounds were originally notified. Grounds four and five were abandoned before the hearing. The remaining grounds are inter-related to a degree. For that reason, it is convenient to consider the remaining grounds in two groups.

GROUP ONE

Ground two 

""Her [H]onour erred in finding that the vulnerability of the victims due to their age was an aggravating factor.""

Ground three 

""Her [H]onour erred in finding that the offences occurring in the homes of the victims was an aggravating feature."" 

Ground ten 

""Her Honour erred in finding as an aggravating feature that there had been multiple victims.""

Background and submissions

41These three grounds are founded on the following portion of the remarks on sentence: 

""Where there is a series of offences of course, the repeated nature of the offences will make the level of criminality more serious. It was submitted by the Crown that the following factors of aggravation apply. (1) the offences were almost all committed in the family home, (2) there was an abuse of the position of trust or authority as previously noted, (3) the victims were vulnerable because of their age, and (4) the offences involved multiple victims in a series of criminal acts.

Counsel for the offender says that the harm caused does not exceed that which is already presumed, and there was no planning beyond that which is inherent in cases of this kind. I accept each of those submissions."" 

42With regard to all of these grounds, counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentence ""I accept each of those submissions"" demonstrates that her Honour was accepting the submissions of both parties, and not merely the two submissions of defence counsel. Whilst accepting that there was some ambiguity about the matter, counsel for the applicant submitted that that was the better reading of the remarks on sentence.

43He submitted that such an approach demonstrated a number of errors with regard to the establishment of aggravating features in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

44As for ground two, founded on s 21A(2)(l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, counsel for the applicant submitted that her Honour had regarded the age of the victims as an aggravating feature with regard to all offences, and not merely some of them, as the Crown Prosecutor at first instance had submitted her Honour should do. Counsel for the applicant made clear in his written submissions in this Court that it would have been open to her Honour to adopt the approach contended for by the Crown. That approach was to differentiate between offences and find the circumstance of aggravation established with regard to some, but not all, of the offences. But, he submitted, the remarks on sentence show her Honour did not adopt that course. 

45As for ground three, founded on s 21A(2)(ea) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, counsel for the applicant pointed to the line of authority to the effect that the circumstance of aggravation of an offence being committed in the home of a victim cannot be made out when the offender is ordinarily there, as opposed to an intruder. On the facts of this matter, he submitted, the applicant never committed any of the sexual offences as an intruder. The family home to which her Honour referred was the home of the applicant. 

46As for ground ten, founded on s 21A(2)(m) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, counsel for the applicant submitted that each offence related to one victim. Each offence came before her Honour for separate consideration, and for the imposition of a separate sentence. Therefore it was erroneous, with regard to each offence, to find that the aggravating feature of there being multiple victims had been made out. Of course that was a feature of the sentencing exercise a whole, he submitted, but that should have been reflected in the sentencing structure and the total operative sentence, not as a matter of aggravation with regard to each individual sentence.

47In this Court, counsel for the Crown made the following responses. As for ground two, the Crown drew attention to the delineation between offences in the written submissions of the Crown at first instance, and submitted that it was consistent with authority. In any event he submitted that analysis of the sentences actually imposed suggests that her Honour had not aggravated the offences by way of the age of the victim, in the practical sense of imposing a sentence that was longer. 

48As for ground three, he submitted that a sentence imposed for an offence that had not been committed in the home was identical to the sentences imposed for equivalent offences that had been committed in the home. Therefore, he submitted, even if there had been an error, one could infer that the aggravating feature had had no effect on the sentences actually imposed. In the circumstances, this Court would not intervene.

49As for ground ten, the Crown submitted that the written submissions at first instance demonstrate that the Crown was not asking her Honour to aggravate any offence on the basis that there were multiple victims. Instead, the sentencing structure as a whole should and would reflect that fact. He submitted that the written submissions at first instance of the Crown merely invited attention to a number of counts that were committed in the context of other offences against the same victim. Accordingly, to the extent that her Honour made clear that she was merely adopting the submissions of the Crown, no error was demonstrated.

Determination

50I am prepared to adopt the reading of the final sentence in the extract from the remarks on sentence for which the counsel for the applicant contends. But even on that expansive reading, ground two must fail. That is because her Honour was indicating that her Honour accepted the submission of the Crown, and counsel for the applicant in this Court concedes that the written submissions of the Crown at first instance on this point were correct. It is true that her Honour did not deal with the submission in detail in the remarks on sentence. But there is nothing in the remarks on sentence to suggest that her Honour went beyond the submission of the Crown, which counsel for the applicant concedes was correct in its discriminating approach.

51It follows that I would not uphold ground two.

52However, grounds three and ten are in a different category. 

53With regard to ground three, the applicant was not an intruder in the premises in which the offences took place. To the contrary, he lived there.

54I accept the submission of counsel for the applicant that, in those circumstances, the fact that almost all of the offences were committed in the family home could not be a matter of aggravation: see Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 at [112] and NLR v R [2011] NSWCCA 246 at [22]. 

55Accordingly, ground three is made out.

56Finally, as for ground ten, perhaps contrary to the submission of the Crown at first instance, her Honour aggravated the offences on the basis of the multiplicity of the victims. That, I respectfully consider, was an error. Her Honour also, it seems in conformity with the submission of the Crown, aggravated the offences on the basis that they were part of a series of criminal acts. But that circumstance of aggravation is directed towards offences that themselves encompass a series of criminal acts. It is not directed towards offences that take their place as one of a series of criminal acts. The distinction is important, and was drawn in R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145; (2005) 65 NSWLR 740 at [28] - [29]. It follows that part of the approach of her Honour was also an error.

57In short, with regard to the aggravating features of there being a multiplicity of victims and there having been a series of criminal acts, I consider that her Honour has erroneously taken them into account with regard to individual offences that were, in truth, committed against one victim only, and encapsulated one criminal act only.

58It follows that I would uphold ground ten.

59In summary, I would uphold two grounds of appeal founded on the proposition that her Honour erroneously took into account aggravating features. Whether those established errors will lead to reduction in any of the sentences imposed upon the applicant is a separate question, due to the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. I shall return to that question later in my judgment.

GROUP TWO

Ground one 

""Her Honour erred in making the non-parole period of each of the three groups of charges wholly cumulative upon each other.""

Ground six

""Her Honour erred in failing to give weight to the sentencing statistics, particularly in relation to the offences involving [JM].""

Ground seven

""Her Honour erred in failing to take general nature of the sentencing patterns at the time of the offending behaviour [sic]."" 

Ground eight

""Her Honour erred in giving undue weight to general deterrence in circumstances where there had been considerable delay between the offending in the time of sentencing where there had been reform to the offender [sic].""

Ground nine 

""Her Honour erred in failing to set the non-parole period in accordance with the provisions of the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 (NSW) and Probation and Parole Act 1983 (NSW) in the fixing of the non-parole terms.""

Ground eleven

""The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.""

Background and submissions

60The first five grounds above underpinned the last. At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the applicant submitted that his central complaint was that the sentences, both individually and in their total effect, do not adequately reflect the sentencing practices that existed at the time of the commission of the offences.

61It is convenient to discuss ground eight first. The ground asserts that undue weight has been given to a relevant factor. To my mind that is, in truth, a particular of ground eleven: see Hanania v R [2012] NSWCCA 220 at [33]. It follows that I will consider it when I come to consider ground eleven. 

62But it is useful to say at this stage that, whilst it is true that the applicant had not offended again since the last of the offences, it is also true that, having sexually assaulted his three victims over many years, he escaped justice for decades and enjoyed a life free from opprobrium or punishment for his crimes during that time. Furthermore, even if the ""reform to the offender"" had been truly exemplary, general deterrence would still have had a significant role to play in sentencing an offender who was convicted of 25 sexual offences after three trials, those offences having been committed against three young girls over an extended period.

63I would not uphold ground eight as a separate ground

64Grounds six, seven and eleven focus upon the fact that her Honour was sentencing in 2011 for offences committed many years before.

65The submission of counsel for the applicant can be encapsulated in a number of propositions.

66First, it was incumbent upon her Honour when sentencing the applicant to take into account the pattern of sentencing that existed at the time of the commission of the offences.

67Secondly, material before her Honour and this Court in the form of sentencing statistics and other material was not able to demonstrate the relevant sentencing pattern with perfect clarity. But it was sufficient to establish that sentences were markedly more lenient at the time of the commission of the offences in question.

68Thirdly, that is especially the case with regard to the offence of indecent assault, which forms a substantial proportion of the offences of which the applicant was convicted. Furthermore, the proposition holds true even when one takes into account that, prior to 1981, many offences that would nowadays be dealt with as founded upon sexual intercourse were dealt with as indecent assaults.

69Fourthly, not only were sentences in those days more lenient, but also the general rule was that non-parole periods were between one-third and one-half of their head sentences. Her Honour should have adopted a sentencing structure that reflected that proposition, not only with regard to individual sentences, but also with regard to the overarching total head sentence and total non-parole period.

70Fifthly, the head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 6 years imposed for the offence of rape committed against the victim JM is markedly inconsistent with sentencing practices in 1977.

71Sixthly and finally, error has been established, and this Court should intervene to correct it by reducing the total head sentenced to some degree and by reducing the total non-parole period markedly.

72In response, the Crown made the following submissions.

73First, he accepted that it was incumbent upon her Honour to take into account sentencing practices at the time of the commission of the offences. However, he submitted that that aspect of the process had been specifically drawn to the attention of her Honour, and reference was made to it in the remarks on sentence. In short, he submitted that this was not a case where a relevant consideration on sentence had been completely overlooked; rather, it was a case in which a relevant factor had indeed been considered, and the applicant was complaining merely about the discretionary decision as to how to reflect it in the sentence.

74Secondly, he accepted that sentences for sexual offences have increased since the commission of the last offence of the applicant in 1984. He referred specifically to the introduction of ""truth in sentencing"" (by which I understand him to mean the abolition of remissions many years ago), and the commencement of the regime of standard non-parole periods. 

75In oral argument, counsel for the Crown stated that he did not cavil with the proposition that sentences for sexual offences have increased markedly in the past 25 years.

76Nevertheless, he submitted thirdly that her Honour had explicitly referred to the matter in the remarks on sentence, and taken it into account. In the circumstances, this Court would be slow to intervene with regard to the discretionary question as to what should be the ultimate sentence, in light of the application by her Honour of the relevant principle. 

77Fourthly, he submitted that, in truth, the statistics and other materials provided to her Honour and before this Court do not clearly establish that sentences imposed at the time of the commission of the offences were markedly below those imposed by her Honour. With regard to the particular challenge against the sentences imposed by her Honour for offences of indecent assault, he submitted that that proposition of counsel for the applicant could not be sustained.

78Fifthly, he rejected the proposition that one can be satisfied that the sentence imposed for the rape of JM has been demonstrated to be inconsistent with sentencing patterns prevailing at the time of that offence. He reminded the Court that the offence was committed against a girl of 9 or 10 years of age who was in the care of the applicant, and that the offence inherently featured penile vaginal penetration. He also noted the fact that the maximum penalty for the offence of rape at the time was imprisonment for life, and that the offence had carried the death penalty until 1955. He submitted that nothing serves to establish that the sentence imposed by her Honour was inconsistent with the range of sentences imposed historically for that offence.

79Sixthly, he accepted that there is authority for the proposition that sentences for offences committed before the introduction of a statutory ratio between a head sentence and a non-parole period should generally seek to replicate the practice of the non-parole period then being about 50 per cent of the head sentence. However, he sought to demonstrate by reference to authority that that is not an ironclad rule, and that this Court has demonstrated a degree of flexibility with regard to the question.

80Seventhly and finally, he submitted that, even taking into account the sentencing patterns of the 1970s and 1980s, both a sentencing judge and this Court must impose a sentence today that reflects the overall criminality of an offender, along with a non-parole period that reflects the minimum period of incarceration required to be served.

81In short, while accepting the correctness of some of the submissions of counsel for the applicant, his ultimate submission was that this Court would not interfere with the sentences imposed.

Determination

82At the outset, I wish to emphasise that the following is a discussion of the imposition of appropriate sentences for sexual offences committed against children in the vicinity of three decades ago. My judgment says nothing about appropriate sentences for such offences committed today, or in the more recent past.

83Generally, I accept the propositions of counsel for the applicant. I consider that the following principles are established.

84It is true that, for over a decade, it has been clear that a sentencing judge dealing with very old offences must take into account the sentencing patterns that existed at the time of the offences: see R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; (2002) 54 NSWLR 368; (2002) 130 A Crim R 481.

85If such a pattern is unable to be discerned, the judge should commence the sentencing process in the usual way; that is, by reference to the maximum penalty, and the place in the range of objective gravity occupied by the offence: see Moon v R [2000] NSWCCA 534; (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 at [66] - [71] per Howie J (with whom Fitzgerald JA agreed).

86Even if a sentencing judge does take an established sentencing pattern into account, a failure adequately to reflect the principle and the relevant sentencing pattern may cause the sentence to be manifestly excessive, or otherwise erroneous: see RWB v R [2008] NSWCCA 93; (2008) 184 A Crim R 453 at [24] - [26]. 

87If sentencing for offences committed at a time when the statutory ratio did not exist, sentencing judges should sentence in accordance with that fact: see AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51; (2007) 169 A Crim R 32 at [36] - [37] and Rosenstrauss v R [2012] NSWCCA 25 at [16].

88Having said that, a court sentencing today with regard to old offences with regard to which a different sentencing pattern can be discerned must nevertheless bear in mind that, since 1974, it has been established that a non-parole period represents the minimum period of imprisonment required to be served by an offender having regard to all of the purposes of justice: Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623, referred to in AJB v R and many subsequent cases dealing with the principle under discussion.

89Finally, in appeals to this Court, reduction has not been automatic, even if it is determined that the sentencing judge failed to advert to the principle: see, for example, Mottram v R [2009] NSWCCA 210 and RLS v R [2012] NSWCCA 236.

90Applying those principles to this case, I consider that a sentencing pattern with regard to sexual offences committed against children in the late 1970s and early 1980s can be established. That is founded upon five factors. The first is the statistics that were before her Honour and this Court relating to disposition of offences in 1976 and 1978. The second is summaries of cases. Some were provided by the parties to her Honour. Others are contained in other decisions of this Court dealing with this question. The third is the general increase in sentences that has occurred across the board in New South Wales over the past quarter century. The fourth is the upward movement in maximum penalties with regard to the crimes of the applicant between the period under consideration and today. The fifth is judicial memory. I shall deal with each of those factors in turn.

Statistics from the 1970s

91I consider that the statistical material provided to her Honour demonstrates that the offence of indecent assault, including against children, was dealt with more leniently many years ago than it is now. The document entitled ""New South Wales Statistics of Higher Criminal Courts 1976"" and published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, NSW Office, shows that 77 offenders were dealt with that year for indecently assaulting a female. (These statistics do not differentiate between offences committed against adults and children.) Of those, only 24 were imprisoned. Of the 26 offenders dealt with for indecently assaulting a male or committing an act of indecency with a male, only 10 were imprisoned. 

92It will be recalled that, before 1981, indecent assault encompassed many sexual acts that fall within the definition of sexual intercourse today. It will also be recalled that the statistics to which I refer are reflective of dispositions in the higher courts, and not in the Courts of Petty Sessions.

93A document with an identical title and from the same source but pertaining to 1978 shows that, of 85 offenders convicted in the higher courts of indecently assaulting a female, only 36 were imprisoned. With regard to the 27 offenders convicted of indecently assaulting a male or committing an act of indecency with a male, only 12 were imprisoned.

94With regard to both years, an examination of the length of sentences imposed upon those who were imprisoned shows that they were short compared to those imposed for equivalent offences today. For example, in 1976, of the 24 offenders imprisoned for indecently assaulting a female, 16 received a non-parole period of less than one year. In 1978, of the 36 offenders imprisoned for that offence, 13 received a non-parole period of less than 1 year, and 27 received a non-parole period of less than 2 years. 

95In short the statistics provide support for the proposition that dispositions and sentences for the offence of indecent assault were more lenient in the late 1970s than they are today.

96I turn to consider the same statistics with regard to the offence of rape. It will be recalled that, until 1981, it carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life, and was restricted to offences founded upon penile vaginal sexual intercourse. 

97The statistics from 1976 and 1978 demonstrate that lengthy head sentences were imposed for that offence.

98In 1976, of the 69 offenders convicted of rape, 68 were imprisoned. Of those 68, 35 received a head sentence of imprisonment of between 5 and 10 years, and 25 received a head sentence of imprisonment for 10 years or more.

99In 1978, all 62 offenders convicted of rape were imprisoned. Thirty-two received a head sentence of between 5 and 10 years, and 25 received a head sentence of imprisonment for 10 years or more.

100Those statistics do not support the proposition that head sentences for rape in the late 1970s were shorter then head sentences for an analogous offence committed today.

101However, the picture is slightly different with regard to non-parole periods imposed for the offence of rape in the latter half of the 1970s.

102In 1976, it is true that 19 offenders received a non-parole period of imprisonment for 5 years or more. On the other hand, 30 offenders received a non-parole period of less than 3 years.

103In 1978, of the 62 persons convicted and imprisoned, 10 received a non-parole of imprisonment for 5 years or more. On the other hand, 19 received a non-parole period of less than 3 years.

104I consider that those statistics provide some support for the proposition that the range of non-parole periods imposed in the late 1970s for the offence of rape was more lenient than the range of non-parole periods imposed for an analogous offence today.

105In short, the statistics from 1976 and 1978 provide some support for the proposition that punishments for serious indecent assaults have become more severe. The statistics do not support that proposition with regard to head sentences for the offence of rape, when compared to its modern analogues. The statistics provide a small amount of support for the proposition that non-parole periods have become more severe with regard to offences that, prior to 1981, would have been prosecuted as rape.

Decisions of this Court

106Secondly, tables and summaries of cases support the proposition that sentences for sexual offences against children have increased. A table prepared by the research section of the Public Defenders Chambers was placed before her Honour, and this Court. It relates to appeals between 1983 and 1991 for offences against s 61D of the Crimes Act 1900; that is, offences of sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of 16 years. There is no need to annex a copy of that table to my judgement, as I understand that it is readily available on the Internet.

107That table shows two things. The first is that sentences, both as to head sentence and non-parole period, moved upward to some degree during that period. The second is that, at the beginning of the period, sentences, and especially non-parole periods, were lenient by the standards of today.

108Separately, in considering the question of the establishment of sentencing patterns for historical sexual offences against children, decisions of this Court have provided reviews of sentencing for such offences in the past.

109In Featherstone v R [2008] NSWCCA 71; (2008) 183 A Crim R 540, Bell JA (as her Honour then was) at [33] - [44] provided details of a number of decisions of this Court between 1990 and 1998 with regard to the sexual assault of children. I am of the view that, considered as a whole, those summaries show that sentences for such offences have moved upwards.

110To take but one example from that review, it is instructive to consider the case of R v Eagles (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported). In Featherstone v R, Bell JA summarised R v Eagles as follows:

""[T]he applicant applied for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed on him for 18 assaults committed upon five young boys. A number of the offences occurred in circumstances in which the victim had come into contact with the applicant through his participation in the scouting movement. In one instance the applicant had been baby-sitting the victim whilst his mother, a near neighbour, worked nightshift. The offences included counts of homosexual intercourse with a male under 18 years under to s 78K, an offence punishable by a maximum term of penal servitude for 10 years. These offences involved anal intercourse with boys aged 10 years and 11 years. The offender defended the first of the charges involving victim A, a 10 year-old child. Following his conviction he pleaded guilty to offences involving the other four victims and asked that a further number of offences be taken into account on a schedule. The overall sentence imposed was ten years consisting of a minimum term of penal servitude of seven years and an additional term of three years. The sentence was described by Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Allen and Newman JJ agreed) as being ""perhaps at or near the top of the range"" but nonetheless within discretion."" 

111It is inconceivable that such a sentence, for a multiplicity of serious offences against a series of victims, could be described as ""perhaps at or near the top of the range"" today. Indeed, I consider that such a sentence would run a serious risk of being characterised as manifestly inadequate.

112Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that that was a decision of this Court nine years after the commission of the last offence of the applicant. 

113In PWB v R [2011] NSWCCA 84, RS Hulme J provided a summary in table form of sentences of this Court imposed between 1990 and 1999. The table relates to sentences for offences of indecent assault and indecent assault against a person under the age of 10 years, created by ss 61E and 61M(2) respectively. Again, I shall not reproduce that table in this judgment, as it is readily available.

114I will not engage in a detailed analysis of its contents. It is true that it reveals that some substantial sentences were imposed during that time. Nevertheless, I consider that the general flavour of the contents of the table is of sentences that were less substantial than they would be if they were being considered or imposed by this Court in 2013. And it will be recalled that the table covers a period that begins 6 years after the last of the offences of the applicant.

115In short, decisions of this Court support the proposition that sentences for offences against children have increased over the past decades.

Increase in sentences generally

116The third factor is the increase in sentences generally for serious offences since the last of the offences of the applicant.

117Over the past 25 years, there have been a number of developments within the criminal justice system of New South Wales that have led to a lengthening of sentences to be served, both with regard to sexual offences and offences generally. Without seeking to be exhaustive, they include: the creation of the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence by way of the Probation and Parole (Serious Offences) Amendment Act 1987, and its expansion to all offences by way of the Sentencing Act 1989; the abolition by the same Act of remissions; the creation of ""natural life"" sentences; the steady increase in maximum penalties, including but not limited to sexual offences; the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610, which led to more focus upon accumulation and partial accumulation when sentencing for more than one offence; most of the guideline judgments of this Court, commencing with R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R 149; the watershed decision of this Court in R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58, which had the effect that sentences for serious sexual offences were thereafter lengthier; and finally, the commencement of the regime of standard non-parole periods in 2003.

118There have been few countervailing developments with regard to serious offences.

119In short, there has been a steady increase in sentences for serious offences across the board, and sexual offences have not been excluded from that process.

Maximum penalties for these offences

120The fourth factor is the increase in maximum penalties for the offences committed by the applicant between their commission in the latter part of the 1970s and the early part of the 1980s and today. I bear in mind the point made by Mason P in dissent in R v MJR that this is a slightly different question from that considered in that case and under discussion by me. Nevertheless, I consider that, in order to determine whether sentences may have increased for identical or similar criminal conduct over that period, it is a useful exercise to examine changes in maximum penalties.

121There follows a table that compares the offences of which the applicant was convicted with their analogues if the offences were committed today. Two modern analogues have been provided for the offence of rape, in light of the fact that that offence had no aggravated version founded on the age of the victim, no doubt due to the maximum penalty for the offence.

N/A

122It can be seen that the maximum penalty for inciting acts of indecency has remained constant.

123The maximum penalties for indecent assaults have increased markedly. Such offences also now attract a substantial standard non-parole period.

124The maximum penalty for sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of 16 years has also increased markedly. Indeed, it is noteworthy that the offence now attracts a standard non-parole period that is equal to the pre-existing maximum penalty. That of itself is instructive.

125The maximum penalty for rape has decreased, although, if one considers the offence of sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of 16 years as the modern analogue on the facts of this appeal, it retains a substantial maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. It also features a standard non-parole period that of course did not exist in the 1970s.

126In short, with regard to most but not all of the offences for which the applicant stood for sentence, the maximum penalty has increased. That provides some support for the proposition that the pattern of sentencing has increased.

Judicial memory

127The fifth factor is judicial memory. Bell JA referred to it in Featherstone v R, when her Honour said at [45]:

""[T]his review of a small sample of cases involving broadly similar sexual offences does support the applicant's submission that there has been a significant upward trend in the length of sentences for offences of this character in recent years. It is an impression that accords with my recollection of the pattern of sentencing for sexual offences before the introduction of the Sentencing Act."" 

128RS Hulme J referred to it in PWB v R, when His Honour said at [68]:

""Although as I have said, the Applicant was entitled to be sentenced in accordance with the sentencing standards applicable at the time of his offending, in the case of the second offence, 1991, it is not easy to determine what those standards were. I have no difficulty in accepting that they were more lenient than at present. This has been recognised in Featherstone v R [2008] NSWCCA 71 at [45]; McGrath v R [2010] NSWCCA 48 at [62]; R v RWB [2010] NSWCCA 147 at [176] and accords with my own recollection of events. However, such recognition provides no indication of what the standards were.""

129My impression is identical to that of Bell JA and RS Hulme J: sentences have indeed increased for serious sexual offences over the past quarter century, in some cases markedly. The concession made in this Court by the Crown Prosecutor, who happens to be a most experienced practitioner in the area of criminal law, lends support to my recollection.

Conclusion regarding pattern of sentencing

130In short, for five reasons, I consider that it has been established that a pattern of sentencing for sexual offences against children in the latter half of the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s has been established. 

131Although it cannot be discerned with exactitude, I am satisfied that such sentences were shorter at the time than they are now; both with regard to offences founded upon sexual intercourse, and also with regard to offences of indecent assault and the like. 

132I also think it likely that the overall range of non-parole periods for offences that were prosecuted as rape before 1981 has increased. However, I am not satisfied that sentences for rape committed against children before 1981 were shorter than sentences imposed nowadays for sexual intercourse without consent with children founded on penile vaginal intercourse, whether as to head sentence or non-parole period.

The sentences under appeal

133The question therefore is whether the sentences imposed by her Honour fail to reflect sufficiently the sentencing practice for sexual offences committed against children between 1977 and 1984. In considering that question, I bear in mind the proposition that, even when giving effect to that principle, sentences imposed now must adequately reflect the criminality of any offender, whenever the offences were committed.

134I consider that the question must be answered in the negative with regard to the offences against KB. It will be recalled that the offences spanned a period from 1977 until 1984. Of the 12 offences, six were indecent assaults that carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 6 years. Six were offences of sexual intercourse without consent with a person under 16 years, which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. Of the latter group of offences, count 13 was founded upon penile vaginal intercourse. 

135The current total sentence for the offences against KB is a head sentence of imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 4 years. I am not satisfied that such a sentence is manifestly excessive, bearing in mind the sentencing patterns of the time. 

136The question must also be answered in the negative with regard to the sentences imposed for the offences against LM. Of the nine offences, five were indecent assaults that carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 6 years; two were offences of inciting an act of indecency, which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment to 2 years; and two were offences of sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of 16 years, which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. The latter two offences were constituted by fellatio and cunnilingus. The offending spanned the years 1980 to 1984.

137The current total head sentence with regard to the offences committed against LM is imprisonment for 6 years with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 3 years. I do not consider that such a sentence is manifestly excessive by the standards of the early 1980s.

138As for the offences against JM, all of them were committed within 1977. The offender was convicted of two indecent assaults, each of which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment to 6 years; an act of indecency, which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment 2 years; and an offence of rape which, as I have said, carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life.

139The total sentence pertaining to the offences committed against JM is a head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. 

140In light of my failure to be satisfied that sentences for rape against children have increased, I am not satisfied that the current total sentence for the offences against JM is manifestly excessive.

141However, that is not the end of the matter. It is also necessary to turn to the contention contained in ground one, and to do so in the context of considering the historical sentencing pattern.

142Had her Honour been sentencing in 2011 for recent offences, it would have been open to her Honour to structure the sentences as her Honour did. Consideration of the sentencing structure shows that all of the offences with regard to each victim were concurrent with each other. That carried with it a degree of leniency. It is true that, as I have said, the non-parole periods imposed for the offences against JM are wholly cumulative upon the non-parole periods imposed for the offences against LM, which are in turn wholly cumulative upon the non-parole periods imposed for the offences against KB. But in light of the fact that there were three separate victims, against whom a number of discrete offences had been committed over an extended period of time, that approach to structuring the sentences would have been open to the discretion of her Honour if the offences were relatively recent ones.

143However, the overarching structure resulting from the approach of her Honour to questions of totality, concurrence, and cumulation needs to be considered in light of the sentencing standards of the late 1970s to early 1980s. The fact is that the approach to questions of cumulation and concurrence was more lax before the handing down of the decision in Pearce v The Queen in 1998. Indeed, sentencing structures in those days often bore a similarity to those that result nowadays from the modern practice of aggregate sentencing, pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

144Considering the maximum penalties applicable at the time of the commission of all of the offences, taking into account all of the objective and subjective features, and bearing in mind the sentencing pattern that existed at the relevant time, I am affirmatively satisfied that the total head sentence of imprisonment for 19 years with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 13 years is manifestly excessive. In particular, I am satisfied that such a total sentence does not adequately reflect the sentencing pattern in existence at the time of the offences.

145Furthermore, I consider that, to reflect sentencing practice in the 1970s and early 1980s, the total non-parole period of the overarching sentence structure should be closer to 50 per cent of the total head sentence than it is currently. To permit the current structure to remain, which features individual non-parole periods that are 50 per cent of their individual head sentences, but (because of accumulation) features a total non-parole period that is 68 per cent of the total head sentence, would not properly reflect the sentencing pattern under discussion. 

146In short, I would uphold ground eleven, along with subsidiary grounds one and nine. Although the submissions regarding grounds six and seven have played a role in my upholding of grounds one and nine, I would not uphold grounds six and seven as separate grounds. For completeness, I indicate that the submissions in support of ground eight did not cause me to uphold ground eleven.

Re-sentence

147Two errors in the sentencing process have been identified by me: an erroneous taking into account of aggravating features, along with a failure to reflect sentencing practices at the time of the commission of the offences that has led to the imposition of sentences that are manifestly excessive. I consider that the discrepancy between the sentence that would have been imposed in the late 1970s or early 1980s and the total sentence imposed in 2011 is a substantial one. Although intervention by this Court in appeals such as this one is not automatic, I consider that, in the circumstances of this case, there should be some reduction. 

148As against the possibility of re-sentence, counsel for the applicant read a short affidavit about the progress of the applicant since sentence. It shows that, since that time, the applicant has sought counselling and treatment, and has been applying himself to various courses conducive to his rehabilitation.

Structural aspects of re-sentence

149In order to achieve what I regard as the correct outcome, no head sentence with regard to any offence will be reduced. That is appropriate, in light of my finding that no individual sentence is manifestly excessive.

150However, the commencement dates of the sentences for the offences against LM will be adjusted, and made partly concurrent with the operative non-parole period relating to the offences committed against KB.

151Similarly, the commencement date of the sentences relating to the offences against JM will be adjusted, with the result that they are concurrent to some degree with the operative non-parole period of the sentences for the offences against LM.

152Finally, in order to achieve a reduction in the ratio between the total non-parole period and the total head sentence, the operative non-parole period with regard to the sentences for the offences committed against JM will be shortened, but only to a small degree. The result will be a total non-parole period that is 56 per cent of the total head sentence.

Conclusion

153I have found that the learned sentencing Judge erred in taking into account certain features as matters of aggravation. I have also found that the sentences are manifestly excessive, in that they do not adequately reflect the sentencing practices of decades ago.

154However, with regard to the latter ground, it remains the fact that the applicant must receive condign punishment, including a total sentence and a total non-parole period that reflect the gross criminality of his offences, along with the extensive damage that he has done to the lives of the three victims. If he had been sentenced in 1985, soon after the end of the offending, he would certainly not have received a short sentence. Even allowing for the historical aspects of the matter, it is incumbent upon this Court to impose sentences that reflect the objective gravity of what the applicant has done.

155I have already recounted the factors that call for alteration of the statutory ratio and constitute special circumstances.

156The orders that I propose will result in a total head sentence of imprisonment for 16 years with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 9 years. 

157Finally, I reiterate that this outcome is founded upon the fact that the offences of the applicant were committed many years ago, when there was a different approach to sentencing for sexual crimes. Nothing can be deduced from this outcome as to sentencing standards in 2013. 

Orders 

158I propose the following orders: 

(1)Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

(2)Appeal against sentence allowed.

(3)Quash the commencement date of the nine sentences imposed for the offences committed against LM. 

(4)In substitution all of the nine sentences imposed for the offences committed against LM are to commence on 26 February 2012.

(5)Quash the commencement date of the four sentences imposed for the offences committed against JM. 

(6)In substitution all of the four sentences imposed for the offences committed against JM are to commence on 26 August 2013. 

(7)Quash the non-parole period of 6 years of the sentence imposed for the offence of rape committed against JM and contained in count 3 of the indictment. 

(8)In substitution impose a new non-parole period for the offence of rape committed against JM and contained in count 3 of the indictment of imprisonment for 5 years, to commence on 26 August 2013 and expire on 25 August 2018.

(9)The new date upon which the applicant is first eligible for release on parole is 25 August 2018.

2419061,R v Nickolas Wayne Galbraith; R v Brendon David Galbraith; R v Robert James Galbraith [2013] NSWSC 284,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Between 24 October 2011 and 28 November 2011 each of the offenders stood trial in Newcastle before a jury on an indictment charging a series of counts. These were that they:

1. On 27 February 2010 at Port Macquarie in the State of New South Wales did murder Mitchell Reginald Voysey.

2. On or about 27 February 2010 at Port Macquarie in the State of New South Wales did cause grievous bodily harm to Luke Blundell with intent to do grievous bodily harm.

3. On or about 27 February 2010 at Port Macquarie in the State of New South Wales did assault Zac Kenzig thereby occasioning actual bodily harm to him while in company of one another.

4. On or about 27 February 2010 at Port Macquarie in the State of New South Wales did use unlawful violence towards Luke Blundell, Mitchell Voysey and Zac Kenzig by conduct such that a person of reasonable firmness if present at the scene would have feared for their safety.

2To all of these charges the offenders pleaded not guilty. On 28 November 2011 the jury returned verdicts in respect of all offenders of not guilty on the first and third counts in the indictment. The jury was unable to agree upon verdicts that they were directed to consider in the alternative to each of the first and third counts. The jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of all offenders on the fourth count.

3Between 6 November 2012 and 28 November 2012 each of the offenders again stood trial in Newcastle before a jury on an indictment, this time charging two counts that they:

1. On 27 February 2010 at Port Macquarie, in the State of New South Wales, unlawfully did kill Mitchell Reginald Voysey.

2. On or about 27 February 2010, at Port Macquarie, in the State of New South Wales, did cause grievous bodily harm to Luke Blundell, with intent to do grievous bodily harm.

4To each of these charges the offenders pleaded not guilty. On 28 November 2012 the jury returned verdicts of not guilty in each case on the first count in the indictment. On the second count the jury found Wayne Galbraith guilty of causing grievous bodily harm to Luke Blundell with intent and Brendon Galbraith and Robert Galbraith each guilty of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm.

5The offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent is an offence contrary to the provisions of s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment and is subject to a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm is an offence contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act. It carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and is subject to a standard non-parole period of 4 years. The offence of affray is an offence contrary to the provisions of s 93C(1) of the Crimes Act. It carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. It is not subject to a standard non-parole period.

The circumstances of the offences

6During the afternoon of 26 February 2010 a number of young people aged in their late teens began to gather at the home of Tara Mulholland. Ms Mulholland lived with her family in a house situated at the end of Locksley Place, a cul de sac in suburban Port Macquarie. It is uncontroversial that a party of some sort had been organised to take place there on the afternoon and continuing into the evening of that day. Approximately twenty or so teenagers gathered at the house and played music and drank alcohol. The group included Zac Kenzig, Luke Blundell, Kiera Costmeyer and Mitchell Voysey. A number of the people at this gathering ultimately became involved in a series of ugly incidents that included throwing punches and damaging the property of neighbours and cars parked in the street.

7Brendon Galbraith lived in a house at the end of the same cul de sac opposite Ms Mulholland's house at the time. During the course of the evening, some of the teenagers at the party acted in an aggressive way towards him when he came out of his house expressing some concern for what was happening in the street. He asked the teenagers to clean up broken glass on the roadway that would appear to have come from damage done to a car window. His letterbox was ultimately ripped from the ground and his front door was attacked. One of the young men at the party also damaged his utility motor vehicle that was parked nearby. In due course Brendon Galbraith managed to calm the situation down and invited a number of the teenagers into his garage to play pool. However, the police attended in response to calls from other neighbours.

8A short time later Zac Kenzig, Luke Blundell, Kiera Costmeyer and Mitchell Voysey finally left the party on foot. They ended up walking as far as Lake Road, Port Macquarie where the events that give rise to these proceedings took place. 

9Before that occurred, Wayne Galbraith arrived at Brendon Galbraith's house in his red Corolla sedan. Their younger brother Robert Galbraith and his friend Bradley Clenton accompanied him. It appears that Robert Galbraith and Bradley Clenton had been walking home after having seen a movie together at the local cinema when Wayne Galbraith called or sent a text message to Robert Galbraith to find out where he was. Wayne Galbraith was at that time at his home, having apparently himself received a call from Brendon Galbraith who asked him to come over. Wayne Galbraith drove from his home to Brendon Galbraith's home and picked up Robert Galbraith and Bradley Clenton on the way.

10Many of the teenagers at the party gave evidence at the trials. That evidence included observations of what happened when Wayne Galbraith and the others arrived at the cul de sac in his car. It is at least clear that the occupants of the car entered Brendon Galbraith's house, or possibly his garage, and that a short time later emerged from the house with him and re-entered Wayne Galbraith's car and drove away. Some of the witnesses gave evidence that when the men emerged from Brendon Galbraith's house they were carrying what have variously been described as weapons or poles or bars. No single consistent or regularly reoccurring description has prevailed. One witness described what she saw as a crow bar. Another witness suggested one of the men was carrying what looked like a pool cue. This issue is referred to in more detail shortly.

11Bradley Clenton gave evidence at both trials. He was originally charged with offences along with the Galbraiths, including murder. On 14 October 2011, shortly before the commencement of the first trial, the Attorney General gave him an indemnity. Mr Clenton provided an induced statement. He gave evidence that the offenders were armed with gear locks or club locks used to secure motor vehicles against theft. He drew a diagram of such an implement as part of his evidence. Bradley Clenton said that the offenders gathered these items before they left Brendon Galbraith's home in the red Corolla. He denied that he was carrying any such implement. 

12In the course of driving in Wayne Galbraith's car after leaving the cul de sac, the occupants came upon Zac Kenzig, Luke Blundell, Kiera Costmeyer and Mitchell Voysey in Lake Road. The vehicle came to a sudden stop and all four of its occupants alighted. Mr Clenton said that the Galbraiths did so armed with the items he described. Each of the offenders denied in their ERISPs having any such implement in their respective possession when they did so or that they had such items in their possession on that evening at any time at all.

13Upon alighting from his car in Lake Road, Wayne Galbraith immediately approached Luke Blundell and struck him a single blow to the side of his head. Mr Blundell immediately fell to the ground where he lay motionless. Wayne Galbraith placed him into the recovery position in the spot where he lay on the side of the road. Mr Blundell sustained a fractured skull as a result of this assault upon him.

14Evidence was given at the first trial that Brendon Galbraith assaulted Zac Kenzig at about the same time. That alleged incident formed the basis of the third count on the original indictment. None of the three offenders was found guilty of any offence specifically based upon such an assault having taken place and I find on the balance of probabilities that it did not occur. 

15Mitchell Voysey was nearby when Luke Blundell was struck and proceeded to run from the scene. Brendon Galbraith and Robert Galbraith immediately pursued him. Although it is not possible to say with certainty, the chase lasted only a comparatively short time and covered only a relatively short distance. At some point Brendon Galbraith gave up the chase because of his asthma. Robert Galbraith did not. The chase ended when Mitchell Voysey veered onto and across Lake Road while running from his pursuers, and into the path of an oncoming car driven by a Mr Arscott. Mrs Arscott was sitting in the front passenger seat. Mitchell Voysey collided with the front of the vehicle, causing minor damage to the bonnet and smashing the windscreen with his head. He rolled across the car and onto the roadway on the passenger side where he lay motionless. Mitchell Voysey died as a result of the injuries sustained by him in this way.

16Neither Mr nor Mrs Arscott described having seen any of the offenders armed with weapons of any kind.

17Robert Galbraith and Brendon Galbraith did not remain at the scene of that event or render assistance of any kind to Mitchell Voysey. Instead they turned immediately and ran back to where Wayne Galbraith's car was still located in the position where it had stopped on Lake Road. All four of its original occupants re-entered the vehicle and drove directly to Wayne Galbraith's home.

18Wayne Galbraith later called the police from his home and advised that there had been an incident at Lake Road. The police attended his home a short time later. The offenders and Bradley Clenton were still there when the police arrived. All three offenders participated in ERISPs. 

19Wayne Galbraith was arrested and taken into custody on 27 February 2010. He remained in custody until released on conditional bail on 4 May 2010, being a total period of 9 weeks and 3 days. Brendon Galbraith and Robert Galbraith were arrested and taken into custody on 28 February 2010. They remained in custody until released on conditional bail on 4 May 2010, being a total of 9 weeks and 2 days.

20With one exception, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, and consistent with the juries' verdicts that have been returned, of these relevant circumstances relating to the offences in the ways just described. I am similarly satisfied with respect to the findings that I have made in the context of the objective gravity of the offences. These findings are dealt with later in these remarks.

Weapons or no weapons

21The exception to which I have just referred relates to the question of whether or not the offenders were armed with weapons or implements of any kind. This issue needs to be analysed separately.

22It is generally not possible to know or to ascertain precisely what it is a jury may have accepted. In criminal proceedings where the nature of the charge and the nature of the verdicts of the jury do not necessarily or in all respects identify for the judge or for anyone precisely what facts the jury has accepted as being proved to its satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt, I am required as the basis for sentencing to form my own view of the facts within the ambit of the verdicts and of the charges: R v Martin [1981] 2 NSWLR 640. In forming that view, I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. I am not, however, restricted to a version of events that is most favourable to the offenders.

23The question of whether or not any of the offenders were armed with anything that may generally be described as a weapon was the subject of considerable evidence during both trials and figured prominently in the respective final addresses of counsel to the juries. As I have indicated, no consistently reoccurring description emerged from the evidence in a way that pointed persuasively in only one direction. 

24Mr Mudford was a witness who lived in an apartment immediately adjacent to the events that occurred in Lake Road. He said in an apparent reference to one of the offenders, ""I think this male may have been carrying something in his right hand."" He said, ""The item looked to be about one foot long and thin"" or that ""It may have been a thin bar."" He described seeing something that appeared to have ""caught the street lights"" in the hands of one of the offenders. His evidence was not at all specific as to the possible nature of the item in question.

25Ms Mulholland spoke of seeing the offenders emerging from Brendon Galbraith's house carrying ""things"". She said, ""I seen two of them carrying, like, crow bar looking things, with a hook on the end."" She went on to say that ""I didn't know what they were, so I just seen that the things had, like a hook on the end, and then I've always known that a crow bar has kind of got a hook on the end, so that's the only way I could have described it"". She later referred to one of the offenders carrying a pool cue.

26Ms Costmeyer gave evidence that she saw what she described as ""the other three men run back to the car and get in the car with their weapons."" She gave no detailed description of what the weapons may have been. Ms Costmeyer was able to give the police an accurate report on the number plate of Wayne Galbraith's car. She was, however, completely confused in her recollection of what happened to Mitchell Voysey, whom she described as having been beaten by some of the offenders rather than as having been struck by Mr Arscott's car.

27Bradley Clenton's evidence was in contrast particularly detailed. His hand drawn sketch of the implements he said the offenders were carrying is a fair representation of what might be generally understood as a locking or anti-theft device for a vehicle. He was in the presence of the offenders at all times when it is alleged these implements were acquired or carried. He rode in the car with the offenders when the items were allegedly present. He was also in the car when driving to Wayne Galbraith's house following the incident at Lake Road. He was present at Wayne Galbraith's house when the items were allegedly still there.

28Bradley Clenton was, however, a person who might reasonably be supposed to be criminally involved in the events that gave rise to the proceedings. He had avoided prosecution for his involvement in any of the events at Lake Road in the way that I have briefly described. I gave the juries warnings and directions about how to approach Mr Clenton's evidence in those circumstances. His evidence necessarily needs to be considered by me in the same light, and having regard to the same warnings and possible doubts about his reliability and truthfulness to which I directed the juries at the trials. 

29There was also medical evidence given upon the question of whether or not the blow struck upon Luke Blundell was consistent only with a weapon having been used or whether the same injury could have been sustained from a blow from a punch with a closed fist. The evidence about this was not entirely satisfactory. There was, however, evidence from one of the doctors who were called that supported the proposition that an unarmed assailant could have caused Mr Blundell's injuries.

30There is in addition the question of whether or not a finding that weapons were present could be regarded as consistent with the juries' verdicts in any event. The jury at the first trial acquitted the offenders of the charges of murder. The jury at the second trial acquitted the offenders of the charges of manslaughter. Ms Walsh argued on behalf of Wayne Galbraith that those results were alone or together inconsistent with any finding by me beyond reasonable doubt that the offenders had weapons. Her proposition was that on both the occasion of the first and the second trials weapons were relied upon by the Crown as the foundation of the murder charge and later the manslaughter charge. Those acquittals are therefore said to be inconsistent with any finding that weapons were present at or used in the commission of any of the offences of which the offenders have been found guilty. 

31By way of emphasis of this point, Ms Walsh reminded me that the juries' respective verdicts of not guilty of murder and not guilty of manslaughter were logically or at least arguably at odds with Mitchell Voysey having been pursued to his death by either Brendon Galbraith or Robert Galbraith armed with a weapon. Her contention was that verdicts of acquittal on those charges were inconsistent with a finding by me beyond reasonable doubt that these offenders, or any of them, could have been armed.

32I do not consider that I have to resolve that argument. The state of the evidence is not in my opinion capable of supporting a finding on the balance of probabilities, let alone beyond reasonable doubt, that the offenders were armed. No weapons were recovered. In that respect I note that I rejected applications to lead evidence of a search that was said to have been conducted by a police scientific officer in the underfloor area of Wayne Galbraith's home some many months after 27 February 2010. That search was inspired by latter day evidence from Bradley Clenton that he and Robert Galbraith had secreted the weapons in that location in anticipation of the police coming to the house on the morning of the offences. 

33Electronically recorded interviews with the offenders were tendered in the Crown case against each offender. None of the offenders admitted, and all frankly denied, that they had anything with them in the nature of the items variously described by the witnesses who had given statements to the police about them. On one view the style and content of the protests offered by Wayne Galbraith in his ERISP when confronted with these allegations or accusations might excite some suspicion about their truth. That is however very far removed from a positive finding in accordance with any applicable standard that he or his co-offenders had armed themselves with weapons as alleged.

34I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, and I do not find, that any of the offenders were armed in any way at the time of the commission of the offences for which they stand to be sentenced by me.

Objective gravity of the offences

35The tragic events of this evening require no assistance from me in order to remain forever locked in the minds and hearts of all those who were either directly or indirectly involved or affected. The most significant consequence of that night is obviously the death of Mitchell Voysey whose life was taken as the result of a collocation of circumstances that no-one foresaw and no-one intended. Although at a personal and private level, those who are suffering in the wake of that loss may take or have a desire to express a different view, no part of the sentencing exercise upon which I must embark is concerned with making reparation for that death or with allocating responsibility for it. Most importantly, I make it plain that in light of the juries' verdicts, none of the offenders has been found liable for Mitchell Voysey's death and none of the offenders is to be sentenced as if they had been. Whatever conclusion I come to concerning the objective seriousness of the offences for which the offenders are to be sentenced, it is axiomatic that that conclusion is not and should not be informed in any way by that death.

36The Crown had submitted that the offences all involved some element of planning. That submission is based upon evidence that Brendon Galbraith requested Wayne Galbraith to come to his house with Robert Galbraith where the offenders foregathered before setting out in search of Mitchell Voysey. There is no doubt on the evidence, and I find beyond reasonable doubt, that the sequence of events was as I have described them. The issue that arises is whether when the offenders left Brendon Galbraith's house they did so in order to go looking for Mitchell Voysey, which would be consistent with some degree of planning, or whether they intended to drive directly to Wayne Galbraith's home in order that Brendon Galbraith would not be at his home following the aggressive and threatening behaviour to which he had been subjected. The presence of weapons, which I have discounted, would have been consistent with such a plan. The absence of weapons is not necessarily inconsistent with it.

37Brendon Galbraith gave evidence at the sentencing proceedings that the plan was to go directly to his brother's house. He denied that he was intentionally seeking out people who had been at the party. He agreed in cross-examination, however, that when they came upon the group in Lake Road he said to his brother Wayne Galbraith words to the effect of ""that's them"" and the car stopped. He agreed that when he alighted from the car he indicated that ""there was another guy across the road"" who then commenced to run. That was Mitchell Voysey who was then chased.

38The offenders have all submitted that they were driving directly to Wayne Galbraith's house with no plan or intention to seek out or to find anyone who may have been at the party that evening. It was, according to this submission, no more than a chance encounter when they came upon the group and stopped the car nearby. That submission is inconsistent with Brendon Galbraith's concession that he said ""that's them"", or words to that effect, when the group was spotted. It is consistent with the offenders being on the lookout for the group as they were driving. The plan may have been ill-conceived and unstructured. So much appears to emerge from Brendon Galbraith's frank and somewhat troubling concession that he still to this day does not know why he chased Mitchell Voysey when he commenced to run.

39I find beyond reasonable doubt that the offenders planned to find the group, or more precisely any of the teenagers from the party that may have included Mitchell Voysey and to confront them in some way. I cannot be satisfied that what the offenders did when they found that group was also planned or even known in some general sense to the offenders beforehand. In other words, even though the offenders planned to find the group, the assaults and the conduct amounting to an affray was the unplanned and spontaneous result of coming across the group in the road. In the relevant sense, therefore, I am not satisfied that the offences were part of a planned or organised criminal activity or that planning amounts to an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes.

40Some of the offences were also committed in company. Caution must be exercised, however, in purporting to allocate significance to that as an aggravating feature in the present circumstances. In the first place, the fact that the offenders were in company cannot be a separate aggravating factor in the affray offences that increases their seriousness. That follows from the terms of the relevant section as follows:

""93C Affray 

(1) A person who uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another and whose conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety is guilty of affray and liable to imprisonment for 10 years. 

(2) If 2 or more persons use or threaten the unlawful violence, it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purposes of subsection (1).""

41Having regard to the terms of s 93C(2), the fact that the offenders were in each other's company is necessarily a feature or element that already forms part of the affray offences for which the offenders are to be sentenced. The fact that the offenders were together in a group directly contributed at least to the conduct likely to cause a person of reasonable firmness if present at the scene to have feared for his or her safety, but so much already flows from the subsection. No independent aggravating feature arises for consideration.

42In the second place, at least with respect to the s 35(2) offences for which Brendon Galbraith and Robert Galbraith are to be sentenced, the juries' verdicts are consistent with the fact that they did not physically assault or attack Luke Blundell. There is no evidence to suggest that they did so and I am otherwise satisfied of the fact that they did not do so beyond reasonable doubt. Their criminal culpability accordingly arises from their participation in a joint criminal enterprise with at least Wayne Galbraith who caused the relevant physical harm to Luke Blundell. Any regard by me to the fact of either of them being in company as an aggravating feature of these offences would therefore constitute an impermissible double counting of that feature and I have therefore not separately considered it.

43The offences were committed in the presence of persons under the age of 18 years. I do not, however, consider that that is an aggravating factor adding to the objective seriousness of any of the offences in this case. It is not a matter in the circumstances of these cases that I consider should be afforded any weight.

44The Crown submitted that the affray offences were serious, involving a significant interference with public order and a high level of actual or threatened violence. That submission was advanced not in the sense that I should inappropriately take into account any super added factors that already form part of the affray offences but in aid of the submission that these affray offences were of a serious kind. To that submission must be added the countervailing consideration that the offences took place in a relatively isolated location, being a light industrial precinct with few, if any, residences nearby, and at a time of night when few, if any, members of the public were present. Video evidence of the street scene captured on CCTV footage suggests that there were no people apart from the offenders and the victims present at the time of the commission of the offences apart from the occasional passing car.

45In considering the objective seriousness of these offences I also remind myself that the assault offence for which Wayne Galbraith stands to be sentenced is legally and factually different from the assault offence for which his brothers are to be sentenced. I also remind myself that the affray offences arise out of facts that necessarily include the facts that encapsulate the assault offences and that the offenders are not to be punished twice for what amounts at least in part to the same things. In this last respect I have had regard to the joint judgment in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623 and to the useful analysis of the issue undertaken by Grove J in R v Elphick [2010] NSWCCA 112.

46Wayne Galbraith's offence of intentionally causing grievous bodily harm to Luke Blundell is in my opinion a very serious example of an offence of its kind. Wayne Galbraith's own description of the incident, given in the course of his electronically recorded interview with the police, bears chilling witness to that fact. Wayne Galbraith said this:

""I've just come across from the side and cracked him in the yeah, gave him a, a hit up the side of the head and he just went straight down...Yeah, just sort of hit him. I was just yeah, yelling at him while he was down, sort of scrambling around a little bit...That's when I've cracked him, he went down and I was yelling at him...That just happened there 'cause when I like, punched the fella that I, I hit and the way he's sort of gone down there...""

47It is clear from the description that he gave that Luke Blundell's legs in effect gave way beneath him as the result of the blow to the side of his head and he slumped immediately upon the roadway. That suggests that the force of the blow was sufficient to render Luke Blundell immediately, or almost immediately, unconscious. More would that appear to be so inasmuch as the absence of a blunt object used in the assault tends to suggest that the force of the blow with no more than a hand or fist must have been considerable to cause the injuries that were inflicted. The evidence makes it clear that Luke Blundell then lay motionless following the blow to his head. The other evidence confirms that he suffered a fractured skull and that he sustained permanent deafness in one of his ears.

48To the extent that it remains helpful or informative to do so, I find that Wayne Galbraith's assault upon Luke Blundell was above the mid range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind.

49With respect to the s 35(2) offences committed by Brendon Galbraith and Robert Galbraith I have already observed that they did not personally or independently cause direct relevant physical harm to Luke Blundell. To that extent at least there is a very significant overlap between the conduct constituting those offences and the conduct on their part that constitutes the offences of affray. Their culpability for the s 35(2) offences consists in their participation in a joint criminal enterprise with Wayne Galbraith in the way I have earlier described.

50The affray offences are not the most objectively serious examples of offences of this kind. Apart from the circumstantial matters to which I have already referred, the only conduct that I can find beyond reasonable doubt and consistently with the jury's verdict to have occurred, not otherwise subsumed as an element of the other offences, is some loud and aggressive yelling and the chasing of Mitchell Voysey. The timeframe over which that conduct took place was also limited. I have disregarded any conduct occurring after the point when Mitchell Voysey was struck, as the evidence suggests that the offenders were all then in varying respects retreating to the car in obvious anticipation of leaving the scene. That would not in my opinion amount to conduct qualifying as likely to cause the fear contemplated by the section.

51I also reiterate that the death of Mitchell Voysey might reasonably be thought to have had a connection to the activities of the offenders on the evening in question. That connection is not such as to have given rise to any criminal culpability on their part. In particular, in the context of the affray offences, Mitchell Voysey's death is not a legally relevant matter for the purposes of sentencing the offenders on those counts.

52In my view the affray offences fall below the mid level of objective seriousness for offences of that type.

Mitigating features

53I have already determined that none of the offences was part of a planned or organised criminal activity.

54Counsel for Brendon Galbraith submitted that his client was entitled to take the benefit of the fact that he was provoked by ""the victim"" as a mitigating factor. There are a number of problems with that submission in my view. First, the evidence does not reveal that Luke Blundell, who is the only relevant victim for present purposes, provoked Brendon Galbraith in any way at all. Luke Blundell gave evidence. He was cross-examined. There is no suggestion available from any part of his evidence that he was concerned directly or indirectly in any aggressive or threatening confrontation with Brendon Galbraith at his home at Locksley Place. Even though the conduct of others from the party could be characterised as amounting to some kind of provocation, no such conduct could be attributed to Luke Blundell.

55Secondly, I have accepted the offenders' submissions that the offences were not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. That finding includes an acceptance of the fact that he at least did not seek out the victim with some criminal purpose in mind. Brendon Galbraith's approbation of that finding is in my view inconsistent with a simultaneous contention that he was provoked. The notion that he may have been provoked includes the concept that he did what he did in response to the events at his home. Brendon Galbraith has denied that.

56Thirdly, limiting myself to the concept of provocation for the purposes of the sentencing exercise, I am even so not persuaded that the attack upon Luke Blundell was sufficiently closely connected with the allegedly provocative conduct. It was not connected closely in time. That much is apparent from the fact that the group of which Luke Blundell was a member had walked a considerable distance to the location in Lake Road before the offenders confronted them. The response by the offenders was also wholly disproportionate to the allegedly provocative conduct, which I repeat was not the conduct of the only relevant victim.

57Counsel for the respective offenders fairly indicated that provocation in this case was a difficult concept. In my view it is completely irrelevant as a feature mitigating the seriousness of any of the offences being considered.

58By way of contrast, none of the offenders has any record of previous convictions. That significant fact is also relevant to whether or not the offenders are persons of good character, whether they are likely to reoffend and whether they have good prospects of rehabilitation. Although it will be necessary to revisit some of these concepts in the context of my consideration of the offenders' subjective circumstances, I should indicate immediately that all of the offenders are entitled to the benefit of these matters as mitigating features. None of the offenders is likely in my view to reoffend and each offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. It follows as well that the concept of special deterrence does not figure prominently, and on one view ought not to figure at all, in the particular and unusual circumstances of these cases.

59Each of the offenders submitted that they were entitled to the benefit of their remorse as a mitigating feature. It is clear from the terms of s 21A(3)(i) that remorse shown by an offender is available for this purpose, 

""but only if...the offender has provided evidence that he...has accepted responsibility for his... actions, and...has acknowledged any injury...caused by his...actions"". 

60In the events as they ultimately occurred, each offender gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. That did not occur without some urging from me, and in at least one case some faintly persistent urging. However, adverse inferences that may be thought to arise from these erstwhile forensic prevarications cannot be visited upon these offenders with the benefit of whose decisions to give evidence I was finally provided. It is difficult in my view properly to understand and accommodate submissions about remorse without the benefit of such evidence. Expressions about such things so often to be found in psychiatric and psychological reports tendered on behalf of offenders are a poor substitute for a first hand account and may on one view not even amount to evidence of the kind contemplated by the subsection.

61Wayne Galbraith said he was ""devastated"" when he was informed that Mitchell Voysey was in a coma. He said that when he learned of his death he was ""traumatised"". He spoke of the Voysey and Blundell families and said that he was ""just sorry that it happened at all"". Mr Galbraith also said he was sorry ""because this was not a foreseeable outcome of stopping [his] car and having an argument, and it turned into much more than that."" He said he was sorry for everyone involved in the whole situation, including himself.

62Brendon Galbraith was asked by his counsel how he felt sitting in the witness box about all that had happened. He said he felt ""terrible"" and that he thought about it every day. He went on to say, ""More to the point it's affected someone's life I don't even know.""

63Robert Galbraith said that when he thought about what happened that night, the whole thing scared him to death. He said he felt very sorry for everyone and wanted to say he was sorry for everything.

64None of the offenders could be described as particularly articulate. It was obvious and understandable that their public expressions of remorse in the setting of a courtroom surrounded by the victim and the families of Mitchell Voysey and Luke Blundell could not have been particularly easy for them. In so saying I intend to express no particular sympathy for that minor predicament. I mention it to emphasise that the genuineness of expressions of remorse should not be influenced by the quality of their delivery.

65I accept that each of the offenders is genuinely remorseful for what they have done and for the extraordinary and damaging consequences of their actions. There is no doubt that each offender is deeply concerned and worried about his own uncertain future: any expression of regret for what happened will understandably if not inevitably be somewhat self-indulgent. I do not take the view that such self-interest necessarily has a depreciating effect upon the worth of an otherwise apparently genuine statement of contrition for the wrong that has been done to others. The particular circumstances of each offender must ultimately intersect with his ability to persuade a potentially hostile audience that what he says is worthy of acceptance.

66It is to those particular individual features and circumstances that I now turn.

Subjective circumstances

67Wayne Galbraith was born on 2 October 1982. He is now 30 years of age and was 27 years of age in February 2010. He is the second of seven children. He is married with three children aged ten, six and five. He was formerly in full-time employment with a supermarket chain but was stood down from that job upon his release from custody in what appears to have been an atmosphere of concern that the charges he faced were inimical to the interests of his employer. His wife now works as the principal breadwinner and Mr Galbraith takes care of the children. 

68Wayne Galbraith was educated to Year 12 level. He has a history of stable employment. He has no criminal record of any kind. As a result of the adverse local publicity attending the events that generated these proceedings, Mr Galbraith's family have changed their surname for what his counsel described as ""their own safety"". There has been an unfortunate collateral impact upon the family that has in turn affected this offender. At least up until the commission of the offences, Wayne Galbraith and his wife also took care of his brother Robert, who lived with them as he had no alternative accommodation.

69As a result of the economic problems that were experienced following Mr Galbraith's original incarceration, he and his wife could not afford to continue to live in and simultaneously maintain repayments on their house that had been purchased only some weeks beforehand. The family therefore had to move out and is presently living with Mrs Galbraith's parents in a four-bedroom house containing six adults and their three children. They occupy the garage. Their own house is now rented.

70Wayne Galbraith called the police within hours of the commission of the offences. He frankly admitted striking Luke Blundell as earlier described. That admission was not qualified and his description of the assault upon Mr Blundell wholly accorded with descriptions given by others.

71Wayne Galbraith had no known psychological history. He had no issues as a child and had never had counselling prior to these events. He reported both depression and anxiety since committing the offences but has not been treated. He takes no drugs but would appear to have developed an alcohol dependency. He drinks heavily on a daily basis, amounting to as much as two cartons of full strength beer every week.

72A report prepared by Dr Natalie Green, who I assume to be a psychologist, following an assessment conducted on 21 February 2013, was tendered in the sentencing proceedings. I have had regard to the contents of that report.

73Brendon Galbraith was born on 22 February 1985. He is now 28 years of age and was almost 25 years of age at the time of the offences. He is in a relationship and he and his partner have two children and are expecting a third. Each has a child from a previous relationship. The relationship remains strong although it has been placed under considerable strain in the current circumstances.

74Since completing Year 10 Brendon Galbraith has been gainfully employed for the most part in the transport industry. Employment that he had followed at the time of the offences during the previous six years was terminated following his arrest. He is currently employed on a casual basis with a local tree removal company and receives a Centrelink benefit at a reduced rate. He is reported to be an honest and reliable worker and a valued member of the team. He has prospects of more work in the event that he is not incarcerated. Mr Galbraith has no prior record of criminal convictions.

75Brendon Galbraith reported that he has become estranged from his brothers as a result of the events of the night in question and the subsequent legal proceedings.

76Robert Galbraith is the youngest of the offenders. He was born on 29 September 1990. He is currently 22 years of age and was only 19 years of age at the time of these offences. He was educated to Year 10. His literacy and numeracy skills are reported to be poor. He repeated Year 6 as a result of inadequate progress. He was diagnosed with ADHD at primary school, as well as what is referred to as Oppositional Defiance Disorder. He was medicated on Ritalin for that condition until the age of 13 years. He did not have good relationships with his teachers.

77Mr Galbraith is currently unemployed and in receipt of a Newstart allowance. He has previously worked with his father doing work experience as a metal fabricator. He has so far been unable to secure an apprenticeship. He has never been in any form of paid employment despite repeated efforts to find work in the Port Macquarie area.

78Mr Galbraith gave evidence of current sleep difficulties and nightmares, including recurrent thoughts and memories about the death of Mitchell Voysey. He has experienced reactive depressed moods. He constantly ruminates about the events of the night in question. He formerly drank excessively but has modified his alcohol intake recently. He denied that he became aggressive when intoxicated. He has not been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder other than ADHD and has never attended formal interventions for mental health matters.

79A report dated 28 February 2013 prepared by Mark Howard, a psychologist, was tendered in the sentencing proceedings. I have had regard to the opinions expressed in that report.

Special circumstances

80It was not suggested that any of the offenders can demonstrate the existence of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

General deterrence

81I have already indicated that I see no useful role for special or specific deterrence in the formulation of sentences for these offenders. I accept however that particularly to the extent that these offences can be characterised as having been generated by a (misguided) desire to avenge a previous wrong, they should be unambiguously denounced. 

Disposition

82Each of the offenders in his own way has expressed what amounts to disbelief that he is in the position in which he now finds himself. Each is a first time offender, of good character, with no relevant health or substance abuse problems, from the same good family and with no known or demonstrated propensity for violence or antisocial behaviour of any kind. The victims of their offences were not even known to the offenders prior to the afternoon of the previous day, and then only to one of them. The events of the early morning of 27 February 2010 could hardly have been anticipated to occur as they did, or to affect so many people so painfully. 

83It seems likely that disbelief also finds itself sandwiched between a series of somewhat more fundamental emotions in the direct and indirect victims of these events. Luke Blundell was walking home minding his own business with companions in a well lit street not far from the commercial district of Port Macquarie. They were causing no harm. Whatever may have happened earlier in the evening should by then have passed into irrelevance. 

84I remain at a loss to understand the ferocity of the assault upon Luke Blundell committed by Wayne Galbraith. He had no axe to grind with Mr Blundell. As far as is known, their paths had never crossed. Mr Blundell represented no threat to Wayne Galbraith and offered no resistance to his attack. His injuries were severe and he is permanently disabled as a result.

85I am confronted with a sentencing exercise in which competing considerations of substantial proportions are mounted on opposite sides. On the one hand, Wayne Galbraith's subjective circumstances are arguably as strong as one could be expected to encounter in the case of any offender facing a sentencing for these offences. On the other hand, the unprovoked viciousness of the attack upon Mr Blundell marks it out as a serious crime.

86Brendon Galbraith was clearly at the epicentre of the events that appear to have inspired these offences. His role in their commission is not of the same character. His liability is derivative. He caused no injury to Luke Blundell although he remains to be sentenced for the consequences of his participation in the events that included the assault upon him. The juries' verdicts in my opinion reflect what appears to be a well-considered appreciation and understanding of that role.

87 Alike with his brother Wayne Galbraith, Brendon Galbraith has the benefit of a very strong subjective case. He is a person of otherwise good character with no criminal history, no history of violence, no problems with drug or alcohol abuse or dependence and with strong family and community ties. His chances of reoffending appear to be negligible to non-existent. His prospects for rehabilitation are correspondingly very high.

88Robert Galbraith has clearly grown up with great respect and admiration for his elder brothers. I suspect he has long tried to emulate them in all things. The events of 27 February 2010 are probably no exception. It seems likely that he has no acceptable idea to this day why he became involved in the situation that led to his convictions apart from an unquestioning desire to follow his brothers. In my view Robert Galbraith is socially and intellectually more vulnerable than his co-offenders. That may to some extent be the result of his age but not entirely. He also seems to me to be considerably less robust than his brothers even though he may not be prepared to acknowledge it. Although his prospects of rehabilitation are also good, and the chances of reoffending equally small, I consider that Robert Galbraith would benefit from some close attention and therapeutic counselling and vocational assistance from the Probation and Parole Service if at all possible.

89In the same way as Brendon Galbraith, Robert Galbraith's liability is also derivative. The sentence that I intend to impose upon him ought to be informed by similar considerations. 

90I have considered all possible alternatives to imprisonment. Subject to what follows, I am satisfied that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.

2419067,R v Krbavac [2013] NSWSC 313,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR: Anthony Vjekoslav Krbavac, the accused, is charged with the murder of his uncle, Ervin Krbavac, on 27 March 2012 at Auburn. 
2It is the Crown case that on 27 March 2012, the police arrived at the deceased's home at Auburn to find him on the ground. The accused appeared to be covered in blood and was holding a hammer. The accused is alleged to have hit the deceased numerous times in the head with a hammer and a chisel.  The deceased was conveyed to Westmead hospital where he died as a result of severe head injuries. The accused was arrested and during a police interview made admissions about the death. 
3A question of the accused's fitness to be tried has been raised, and pursuant to ss 8 and 10 of Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, Latham J determined that an inquiry should be conducted. Section 11 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act provides that the question of a person's fitness to be tried for an offence is to be determined by the judge alone.
4The principles that apply in determining an accused's fitness to stand trial for State offences are well-settled. They are stated in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 by Smith J at [48]:
""[An accused] needs, I think, to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand, I think, the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.""

5Presser has been approved by the High Court in Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1 and Kesavarajah v The Queen [1994] HCA 41; (1994) 181 CLR 230. The length of the trial is also a relevant factor. In Kesavarajah the plurality (Mason CJ, Toohey J and Gaudron J) observed at p 246: 
""In the context of a trial, fitness to be tried is to be determined by reference to the factors mentioned by Smith J. in Presser and by reference to the length of the trial. It makes no sense to determine the question of fitness to be tried by reference to the accused's condition immediately prior to the commencement of the trial without having regard to what the accused's condition will or is likely to be during the course of the trial. There is simply no point in embarking on a lengthy trial with all the expense and inconvenience to jurors that it may entail if it is to be interrupted by reason of some manifestation or exacerbation of a debilitating condition which can affect the accused's fitness to be tried. Of course, that is not to exclude from the jury's consideration the question whether the condition is such that difficulties can be accommodated by an adjournment if and when they arise.""
6The Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act governs the approach to be taken in a fitness inquiry for the offence. The Court is required to approach the inquiry in a non-adversarial manner and to determine the question of fitness on the balance of probabilities: ss 6, 11, and 12 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. Neither party bears the onus of proof. 
7Psychiatrist reports have been tendered. I turn to that material.
8The accused who is 41 years old has a documented history of treatment-resistant paranoid schizophrenia for which he has, over the last 16 years, been receiving treatment. Prior to the commission of the alleged offence, the accused has had admissions to Cumberland Hospital and case management, together with treatment for a psychotic illness with antipsychotic medication. 
9There are three reports that discuss the issue of fitness to plead. Dr Richard Furst, Forensic Psychiatrist, prepared two reports dated 28 April 2012 and 6 September 2012. Dr Olav Nielssen, Psychiatrist, prepared a report dated 30 October 2012.
10Dr Furst interviewed the accused at the request of the Legal Aid Commission on 29 March 2012. Dr Furst diagnosed the accused with chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The diagnosis was made on the accused's presentation, who continued to suffer from symptoms of paranoia, auditory hallucinations, and prominent thought disorder. Dr Furst was of the opinion that the accused remained acutely psychotic and lacked insight into his illness On the issue of fitness, Dr Furst writes (ex D p 7):
""[The accused] understood that he had been charged with murder and that this was a serious charge. When asked about his options to enter a plea, he said ""I will plead guilty...the Judge is a chicken.  28 years...32 years. I don't know. The voices say that in 2-months I will wake up from this dream."" He did not appear to understand the gravity of his legal predicament and did not wish to raise the defence of mental illness, probably because he lacks insight into his schizophrenia. 
When asked if he could explain his version of events to his lawyer, he said ""I will plead guilty...I don't want to talk to him. He would punch out people and say that my dad is the greatest if he was on my side.""
[The accused] continues to suffer from acute symptoms of psychosis, has limited understanding of legal concepts, and has little if any insight into his illness or the seriousness of his legal issues, believing that things will ""go away in 2 months."" He does not trust his lawyer and would be unable to communicate his version of events, give instructions accept cogent legal advice, and attend to relevant legal issues in a Court setting. Having regards to the standards of Presser and Kesavarajah, I was of the opinion that [the accused] was not fit to plead and not fit to be tried.""
11Dr Furst next interviewed the accused on 22 August 2012 and confirmed as well as elaborated on the views expressed in his previous report. Dr Furst reports that ""the persistence of [the accused's] acute and disabling psychotic symptoms over the last 5 months in custody confirms the diagnosis of chronic treatment resistant schizophrenia. He has made some progress, but continues to suffer from symptoms of paranoia, auditory hallucinations, and thought disorder. He remains acutely psychotic, is insightless into his illness, and is likely to require long-term hospitalisation under the Mental Health Act"" (ex E p 3). Dr Furst was of the opinion that the accused continues to suffer from acute symptoms of psychosis, has limited understanding of legal concepts, and has no insight into his illness. The accused gave ""thought disordered irrational responses when taken to the Presser criteria"" (ex E p 4). Dr Furst reported that the accused was very likely to have difficulties working with his legal counsel, giving instructions and accepting legal advice. 
12Dr Furst concluded that the accused is ""likely to enter an irrational plea based on his lack of insight into his mental illness. He does not appear to understand that the defence of mental illness is available to him, or if he is aware of the mental illness defence, he does not think it applies to him as a consequence of his ongoing delusional beliefs and absence of insight into his schizophrenia. He would also struggle to pay attention and understand what was said in Court because of his persistent psychotic symptoms"" (ex E p 4). 
13Dr Furst remained of the opinion that the accused is not fit to be tried.
14Dr Nielssen interviewed the accused on 25 October 2012 at the request of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Dr Nielssen also diagnosed chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia, which was made on the basis of the history of constant hallucinations of voices, the corroborative information in the documents and aspects of the accused's presentation, in particular, his disorganised thinking and bizarre explanation for his symptoms. 
15Dr Nielssen concluded that the accused was unfit to be tried. He reports (ex C p 7):""I concur with the opinion of Dr Furst that [the accused] is unfit for trial. He is aware of the charge and that he has the option of entering a plea of guilty or not guilty, because he did not believe he was mentally ill and also because ""voices"" had told him that he might be in custody longer if he was found not guilty due to mental illness. Hence, I believe that he is unable to respond to the charge or provide rational or reliable instructions to his solicitors because he is unable to properly appraise the potential responses to the charges, and any instructions that he does give are likely to be influenced by the content of continuing symptoms of schizophrenia."" 
16Both Dr Furst and Dr Nielssen are of the view that the accused will not become fit to stand trial within twelve months. 
Conclusion
17The Presser criteria are to be considered in light of the complexity and the length of the accused's trial. The Crown estimates, though without any certainty, that the trial will take some 2 weeks. 
18The Crown submits that the accused is unfit to be tried but the accused, through his counsel, Ms Manuell SC, maintains that he is.  The accused does not wish to be found unfit to be tried, which is the position he has maintained throughout the interviews with the psychiatrists. 
19It is the opinion of Dr Furst and Dr Nielssen that the accused is unfit to be tried. I accept their opinions.  
20I am satisfied that the accused is unable to plead to the charge and to make his answer to it. He is not able to give any rational or reliable instructions to his counsel. He does not have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the Court.   
21Accordingly, I find on the balance of probabilities that the accused is unfit to stand trial. 
22I make the following orders:
(1)I find that the accused Anthony Vjekoslav Krbavac is unfit to be tried for the murder of his uncle, Ervin Krbavac, on 27 March 2012 at Auburn contrary to section 18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.
(2)In accordance with s 14(a) of Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, I refer Anthony Vjekoslav Krbavac to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
(3)Pursuant to s 14(b)(iii) of Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, remand the accused in custody until the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal has taken effect.  
(4)I direct the Court Registry to provide copies of the following documentation to the Mental Health Review Tribunal:
(a)this finding and reasons;
(b)the orders made; 
(c)the transcript of these proceedings.
(d)psychiatrist reports; and
(e)the crown case statement.

2419075,Thompson-Davis v R [2013] NSWCCA 75,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY P: I agree with Campbell J.

2HALL J: I agree with Campbell J.

3CAMPBELL J: Hector Thompson-Davis, whom I will refer to as the offender, seeks leave under s.5(1)(c) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (""Appeal Act"") to appeal from the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court of New South Wales by his Honour Judge Toner SC on 1st April 2010. 

4The offence, to which the offender had pleaded guilty only when the matter first came before the District Court shortly before 4th March 2010, was one under s.112(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offender broke into and entered his victim's home knowing she was there. Whilst in the home he committed a serious indictable offence, namely, an indecent assault on his victim. At the time he was sentenced, the offender asked the court to take into account two other offences under s.33 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""Sentencing Act""). The first in time was committing an act of indecency contrary to s.61N(2) Crimes Act; and the second, a stalking offence contrary to s.13(1) Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW).

5The sentencing judge sentenced the offender to a non-parole period of five years, seven months and 24 days commencing on 1st April 2010 and expiring on 24th November 2015 with a balance of term of one year, ten months and eighteen days commencing on 25th November 2015 and expiring on 21st October 2017. The earliest day on which the offender is eligible to be released on parole is 24th November 2015.

6The judicial task undertaken by the sentencing judge on 1st April 2010 was in fact a re-sentence. His Honour had imposed a sentence on the offender on 4th March 2010, but an error in the earlier sentence was drawn to his Honour's attention and he re-opened the proceedings pursuant to s.43(2) Sentencing Act. Both parties agreed that the sentence first imposed was ""a penalty that is contrary to law"", a matter to which it will be necessary to return. 

7If leave is granted, the proposed grounds of appeal are:

1. The sentencing judge erred in re-setting the non-parole period on 1st April 2010;

2. The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

I have concluded that both grounds have been made good, leave should be granted and the appeal allowed. The offender has made an application for remitter under s.12(2) of the Appeal Act. But as I am of the opinion that a less severe sentence is warranted in law, and should have been passed, I consider it appropriate to quash the sentence below and to re-sentence the offender rather than remit, for reasons I will express later.

Factual background

8I will deal with the relevant facts chronologically. Proceeding in this way, the offence for which the offender was sentenced by the primary judge is second in point of time.

9The offender had been released from prison on parole on 31st March 2009. The total term of imprisonment the offender was serving at that time was one of six years and five months expiring on 11th December 2010 and imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Coorey in the Sydney District Court on 6th May 2005. The sentence was taken to have commenced on 12th July 2004. The offence was one of aggravated robbery. Two other offences on a Form 1 had been taken into account, including an offence under s.112(2) Crimes Act. The facts of these matters are not before this Court. However, 11th January 2008 was the earliest date on which he had been eligible for parole.

10After his release on parole, the offender resided in Armidale on the northern tablelands of New South Wales with his partner and two young children until he was taken back into custody after the commission of the instant offences, and his parole was revoked.

11The second offence on the Form 1 is the first of the instant offences in time. On 23rd April 2009 he approached his female victim who was walking her dog on a public street. He asked for directions to the cemetery, which was a pretext for speaking to the victim. The offender acted as though confused and the victim offered to show him the way. She walked ahead of the offender. After a short time, the offender yelled at the victim to attract her attention. When the victim turned she saw that the offender had dropped his trousers and underwear exposing his flaccid penis which he handled as if in an attempt to produce an erection.

12After a short time the offender desisted, apologised and explained that he had recently been released from gaol and had turned his life to Christianity. The victim left the scene and reported the matter to the police. 

13The offence for which the offender was sentenced occurred on 26th April 2009 at 2:00 a.m. First, it is necessary to recount that on the 21st of April 2009 the offender had knocked on the victim's door asking after a person named ""Mark"". This was probably a pretext. The offender was previously unknown to the victim.

14He informed the victim that he was not long out of gaol and needed somewhere to stay. The offender asked the victim if he could use her phone to call a friend. When the victim offered to make the call for him, the offender handed her a piece of paper which was obviously an advertisement for a prostitute ripped from a newspaper. Undaunted the victim dialled the number and handed the phone to the offender who said, ""there is no answer"". The victim showed the offender the door and he left.

15In the early hours of 26th April 2009, the victim was awoken by the sound of knocking on her front door and sidelight. She arose to investigate. As she approached her front door she recognised the offender from his earlier visit.

16The offender called out to her and the victim opened the door, and held it slightly ajar. The offender said:

I am sorry to bother you and wake you up. I know it's the middle of the night. I just need somewhere to stay. 

Again, this was a pretext. The victim refused to admit him. The offender then asked to use her phone to call a cab. And again, rightly, the victim refused. The offender then said:

Alright, alright I'm sorry. I just want to come in and I'll look after you and take care of you. I want to spend time with you. I promise I will be really gentle with you.

The victim quickly shut the door, telling the offender to go away.

17Although, the offender said he would go, the victim saw him looking through her kitchen window. She attempted to stay out of sight. The offender then went to the lounge room window and looked through it, calling out ""please let me in"". The victim said, ""You're scaring me please go away. I'm on my own"". In fact, her young daughter was home and the victim was understandably concealing that fact.

18The offender then broke into the house through the closed front door and confronted the victim in the kitchen. The victim tried to dial 000 but was unable to because the offender moved towards her and pushed her against a kitchen bench. He forced his hands into her dressing gown and put them on her breasts and chest, despite the victim's protestation. She then screamed for help upon which the offender took flight. The victim sought help from a neighbour. Police were called and attended. The officers found that the front door frame, through which the offender entered, was damaged.

19At the time of the break-in only the victim and her twelve-year-old daughter were home. The victim's daughter was unharmed. The sentencing judge found that the offender was unaware of the daughter's presence.

20The first offence listed on the Form 1 occurred on 30th April 2009 at about 8:45 a.m. It is the third offence in time. The offender again approached a female victim on a public street and attempted to engage her in conversation. He said he had just been released from gaol and was feeling a little strange. The offender asked the victim where she lived and if he could go there with her. The victim was afraid and said, ""No"". The offender told her of his conversion to Christianity. The victim excused herself and walked away from the offender, but he followed her. The victim became apprehensive for her safety. When she was near her home, the offender again approached the victim and asked if she lived there. She denied it. But the offender asked if he could come inside for a drink of water. The victim crossed the road and the offender followed saying he needed to go inside her house to use the toilet. The victim told the offender that she had a partner and the offender became agitated. The victim was able to lose the offender. She attended a friend's house and called the police.

21Police arrested the offender on 30th April 2009, on which day his parole order was revoked and he recommenced serving his term of imprisonment. The offender denied the offences. No plea of guilty was entered until the matter came before the District Court in early 2010. 

22The primary judge found that the mention the offender made to his victims of his conversion to Christianity had a sinister connotation, and was an attempt to lull them into a false sense of security. 

Plea in mitigation

23When the matter first came before the sentencing judge on 4th March 2010, the offender had been back in custody for ten months. Notwithstanding this, or perhaps because of it, no up-to-date information was available that might have assisted his Honour in the assessment of the offender's prospects of rehabilitation, or advancing any factors which might have supported a claim for leniency on his behalf. During the course of the proceedings on sentence (10.20 - 30T) the sentencing judge asked why a pre-sentence report was not available. Counsel then appearing had come into the matter late and was unable, for that reason, to provide an answer to the judge's query. No application for adjournment was made to take up the suggestion implicit in his Honour's question. 

24A number of exhibits were tendered which demonstrated that during earlier periods of incarceration, the offender had used his time profitably in courses addressing drug and alcohol relapse prevention, making gifts for aboriginal elders, anger management, and alcohol and violence prevention as well as TAFE courses in carpentry and advanced first aid in the workplace. He was awarded a senior first aid certificate. He was proved to be articulate, capable of writing poetry and skilful as an artist. Regrettably, most of this material was somewhat dated.

25The offender gave sworn evidence. During his evidence he expressed recognition of the need to take personal responsibility for his actions, but said at the time he committed the subject offences, he now realised, he was an institutionalised person who couldn't live without authority. He agreed with the sentencing judge that the crimes before the Court were disturbing and the offender said ""I look at myself as disgusting"". He admitted that he had fallen into a bad pattern of drinking and smoking when he had been released on parole. He spontaneously expressed remorse saying:

I do look at the seriousness of my behaviour and I do fully ... have deep side (sic) of remorse and if I could, I would like to make a personal apology, if I could take the fear out of their hearts that I placed there, I would do that. I deeply regret...my actions, my thoughts, me feelings (sic) you know, desires in my heart ... (POS 8.30 - 35T).

26The offender had a most unfortunate upbringing. He was born at Kempsey of indigenous parents, from whom he was removed at birth because of their alcohol problems. He was raised by his aunt until he was about 13, when he became ""too much for her"" and ""got removed from her custody and care"" (10.5T). He then went through a series of ""about five"" foster placements. He started smoking cannabis and drinking alcohol at age fourteen.

27His criminal record is regrettably very long, commencing on 20th February 1995 when he was aged fourteen and four months. His past offences are various, involving crimes against property, against the person, and many incidents of civil disorder. As I read it, however, there is only one entry on the record of any offence having obvious sexual connotations, being four incidents of wilful and obscene exposure, taken into account on a Form 1 under s.33 Sentencing Act when he was dealt with for an offence under s.112(2) Crimes Act in the year 2000.

28I interpolate that at the very least the record is capable of demonstrating that the offender has ""a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law"". To my mind it is less obvious that it shows ""dangerous propensity"", as his Honour may have thought. His Honour seemed to conclude from the record that the instant offences involving indecency and having sexual connotations were not ""an uncharacteristic aberration"": Veen v. The Queen [No. 2] [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 477.

His Honours Reasons

29Having recited the facts, which I have summarised above, his Honour said (ROS 7):

On any recitation of those facts, the offence is serious. It attracts a standard non-parole period of five years. Albeit that this is a guilty plea, the standard non-parole period acts as a guidepost in sentencing. In any event, I have to determine where this offence rests in the hierarchy of offences of its type. From the recitation of the facts which I find beyond a reasonable doubt, I conclude that this offence rests somewhere above the middle range for offences of it's type.

His Honour regarded the offending he was dealing with as persistent, and premeditated. He regarded the circumstances as terrifying for the victim. He found the offender's history disturbing, and he took the view that lack of control of his sexual urges was a feature of his offending over the years. I interpolate, that is not obvious to me from an examination of the applicant's regrettably long criminal record. I have set out my understanding of his record in this regard at [27]. The information before this Court does not otherwise disclose a history of sexual offences. 

30His Honour accepted the possibility that the offender may have become institutionalised by his long periods of incarceration, but considered that the offender could have done more to help himself whilst in gaol. He referred to the subject offence and the Form 1 offences together as ""[t]his reign of terror of women"" (ROS 9). (The Crown accepted that this was ""hyperbolic""). And his Honour found that the commission of the subject offence whilst the offender was at conditional liberty on parole was a ""significant aggravating feature"", as it no doubt was.

31His Honour found that there were no special circumstances justifying a variation of the s. 44(2) Sentencing Act ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term.

32""Subjectively"", his Honour said (ROS 9):

...there are some interesting aspects to this man. He is clearly intelligent and he clearly has talents. I have seen some of his writings, I have seen copies of his paintings which obviously show talent.

He is a man who sadly has squandered many of his physical talents. 

His Honour noted that at the time of the sentencing hearing he was estranged from his wife and two children and recorded the details of his unfortunate childhood, but observed ""[a]s is the case with far too many young Aboriginal men, he became uncontrollable.""

33Taking notice of the various courses the offender had undertaken whilst incarcerated, including the carpentry course, his Honour observed ""[t]he courses that he has done over the years do not seem to have changed his ways, particularly in relation to offending in the way he has here."" (Emphasis added). As I have said, his Honour referred to Veen [No. 2], but it is unclear, from what he said, whether his Honour decided that there was a particular need to factor the consideration of the protection of society into the appropriate sentence.

34In pronouncing his sentence his Honour said he took into account the matters on the Form 1 and had allowed a 10 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the late plea. He said:

You are sentenced to a non-parole period of five years, four months and twenty-four days to commence on 1 August 2010 and to expire on 24 December 2015. You are sentenced to a balance of sentence of one year, nine months and eighteen days to expire on 12th October 2017.

35As can be seen, his Honour decided to accumulate the sentence he had passed on the sentence that the offender was currently serving. Section 47(2)(b) of the Sentencing Act permitted this partial accumulation, but not where the ""offender ... is serving some other sentence of imprisonment by way of full time detention if"", as here, the non-parole period set for that other sentence has expired, and ""the offender is still in custody under that other sentence"": s.47(5) Sentencing Act. It followed, as both parties soon realised, that, inadvertently, because neither party had drawn s.47(5) to his Honour's attention, the primary judge had ""imposed a penalty that is contrary to law"" within the meaning of s.43(1)(a) Sentencing Act. In these circumstances, s.43(2) Sentencing Act empowered the sentencing judge to ""reopen the proceedings"", after hearing from the parties, to ""impose a penalty that is in accordance with the law"", inter alia.

Further sentencing on 1st April 2010

36When the matter came before the sentencing judge again on 1st April 2010, he recorded that the offender's main concern, as explained by counsel then appearing, was ""that his effective release date be no different"". Exercising the power conferred upon him by s.43 of the Sentencing Act, his Honour decided, ""that the appropriate course then was simply to add four months to the head sentence and to commence the sentence from today"". His Honour quashed the original sentence and re-sentenced the offender as follows:

The offender is re-sentenced as follows in relation to the offence with which he was charged. He is again convicted, taking into account the matters on a Form 1 as I had and adopting the same reasons as I gave on 4 March I re-sentence the offender to a non-parole period of 5 years, 7 months and 24 days to commence on 1 April 2010 and to expire on 24 November 2015 and a balance of term of 1 year, 10 months and 18 days to commence on 25 November 2015 and expire on 12 October 2017.

37It is from this sentence that the offender seeks leave to appeal, as I earlier said. 

38Although the earliest date of eligibility for release was, as the sentencing judge noted, one month earlier, the effect of the re-sentencing was that both the non-parole period and the additional term were lengthened. To illustrate this I reproduce the following tabulation appearing at the end of paragraph 5 of the offender's outline of submissions.

The submissions on appeal

39In relation to ground 1, Ms. A. Francis of counsel, who appeared for the applicant, accepted that the sentencing judge was bound to correct his original s.47(5) error. She argued that as in the particular circumstances of this case s.43(1) of the Sentencing Act was not otherwise engaged, in exercising the powers conferred by s.43(2) Sentencing Act, his Honour was bound to observe and apply sentencing principles of general application: Ho v. Director of Public Prosecutions (1995) 37 NSWLR 393 at 403B - C. For the purpose of this ground, Ms Francis argued, his Honour's original sentence was contrary to law only because his partial accumulation of his sentence on the existing sentence contravened s.47(5) Sentencing Act. There was no other error. Having otherwise already fixed the appropriate sentence for the instant offence (taking into account the Form 1 matters) s.43(2) did not provide the occasion for re-visiting and re-fashioning the sentence previously passed. By seeking to achieve indirectly that which he could not achieve directly by accumulation, his Honour took into account an irrelevant consideration to extend the sentence originally imposed. 

40In relation to ground 2, Ms. Francis reminded the court that manifest excess, as a ground of appeal, states a conclusion the court arrives at after considering all relevant circumstances: Dinsdale v. The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 352 [6]. Of its nature, the misapplication of principle which undermines the sentence may not be identifiable from the primary judge's statement of reasons: Wong v. The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 605[58]; Hili v.The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538-9 [59] - [60]. In written submissions, the applicant provided both judicial commission statistics for s.112(2) offences and a table of comparative sentences. Counsel appropriately acknowledged the limited usefulness of this type of material generally: Wong at 606 [59]; Hili at 537 [54] - [56]; as well as the limitations applicable to s.112(2) offences in particular: Marshall v. R. [2007] NSWCCA 24 at [33]; R. v. Shillingsworth [2003] NSWCCA 272 at [57]; YS v. R. [2010] NSWCCA 98 at [28] - [30]. But it was argued that within the confines of its limited utility, this material bolsters the conclusion that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 

41Orally a third ground of appeal was advanced, namely that his Honour inverted the proper process by adjusting his sentence to give effect to his previously conceived view of proper accumulation; the proper approach required in principle was to first fix the appropriate sentence and ""then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality"": Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at 624 [45] per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ. Here, the discretion to accumulate was limited by s. 47(5), but subject to that consideration the same approach was called for.

42Ms. Francis further argued that the proper order for the court to make was one of remitter under s.12(2) Appeal Act. It was submitted that neither the sentencing court nor this court had before it all material relevant to sentence. Moreover, she informed the court, material that she had seen suggested that a mental illness may have been diagnosed since the offender was sentenced, which would obviously be relevant if he was to be re-sentenced. No evidence, however, was available to be put before this Court to assist it in that regard. It was said that the interests of justice would be better served by having the applicant re-sentenced in the District Court.

43The Crown, in its submissions, emphasised the width of the power conferred on the sentencing court by s.43(2) Sentencing Act. In argument however (at 7.30 - 40T), the Crown accepted that it would have been an error for his Honour to treat his original intended date of expiration of the sentence as a wholly decisive consideration. It was submitted however that even if this error occurred, the Court should conclude that no other sentence is warranted in law.

44With regard to ground 2, the Crown drew attention to the maximum penalty of 20 years, and the standard non-parole period of five years, for s.112(2) offences. The Crown also submitted that his Honour's factual findings were open to him, and justified the sentence fixed, and that applying s.33(2) Sentencing Act, it was necessary to bear in mind the Form 1 offences in fixing the appropriate sentence. Even if ordinarily those additional offences would be dealt with summarily, they made it appropriate that there be some increase in the sentence for the primary offence, which need not be modest: Attorney General's Application [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [18].

45The existence of the Form 1 offences, it was observed, engaged the second element discussed by Spigelman CJ in Attorney General's Application at 159 [42], in particular ""the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed"".

46The Crown submitted that there had been no error in applying the principles discussed in Pearce.


Consideration and decision

47I accept that the sentencing judge erred in the exercise of the wide power conferred upon him by s.43(2) Sentencing Act by treating the date of the expiration of the additional term as originally fixed, namely 12th October 2017, as decisive, even if by refashioning the sentence in the way he did, his Honour produced a non-parole period that expired a month earlier than the non-parole period originally fixed on the 4th of March 2010. Whether or not the offender will be released at the expiration of the non-parole period is a matter for the executive branch of government. Nor does it make any difference that counsel then appearing for the offender expressed the offender's anxiety ""that his effective release date be no different"". The offender obviously desired no increase in the length of the sentence, but he was entitled to be sentenced according to law and his anxiety about that was neither a relevant consideration nor a ""concession"".

48As McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ pointed out in Pearce at 623 - 624 [45]:

To an offender, the only relevant question may be ""how long"", and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality.

49That this statement of principle was made in the context of passing sentence for each of multiple offences simultaneously does not rob it of relevance in the present context.

50As a unanimous High Court said in Muldrock v. The Queen [2011] 39 HCA; 244 CLR 120 at 132 [29], a judge is to: 

identify fully the facts, matters and circumstances which the judge concludes bear upon the judgment that is reached about the appropriate sentence to be imposed. (Emphasis added) 

51Accepting that ""sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer"" (Pearce at 624 [46]) makes no difference to the ""task of the sentencer"" which ""is to take account of all relevant factors and to arrive at a single result which takes due account of them all"": Wong at 611 [75] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ (original emphasis; delineation added). 

52His Honour had sought to undertake that task on 4th March 2010. His exercise of discretion on that occasion miscarried because he imposed a sentence that was contrary to law as it contravened s.47(5) Sentencing Act. In the particular circumstances of this case the exercise of the s.43(2) power did not call for the imposition of a different sentence. In some circumstances the imposition of an entirely different sentence may be legally permissible under s.43(2), but his Honour's exercise of his discretion miscarried because he took into account an irrelevant consideration, namely, his previous determination, affected as it was by error of law, that the sentence should not expire until 12th October 2017. In reality his Honour had made a discrete error readily remediable. I would uphold ground 1.

53As I have already stated, I am also of the view that the offender has demonstrated manifest error. I have borne in mind the following principles:

(a)A finding by an appellate court of manifest excess means that ""the result embodied in the sentencing judge's orders was 'unreasonable or plainly unjust'"": Hili at 538 [58]; House v. the King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505; 

(b)That finding is a conclusion that ""there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons"": Wong at 605 [58];

(c)By its nature, the conclusion that a sentence is vitiated by manifest excess ""does not admit of lengthy exposition"": Hili at 539 [59]. However, it does not follow from this that ""manifest error is fundamentally intuitive"", it is not: Hili at 539 [60]. ""[W]hat reveals manifest excess ... is consideration of all of the matters that are relevant to fixing the sentence"": Hili at 539 [60];

(d)Where an offender alleges manifest excess, the Court of Criminal Appeal assumes that no specific error is alleged: Hili at 539 [61]. Accordingly, it is futile, indeed erroneous, to search for one.

(e)Subject to the adoption of the correct, cautious approach, a consideration of past sentences in closely comparable cases may highlight excess: a consideration of sentences which have in fact been imposed in similar cases does not establish a correct range, but may provide ""a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"": Hili at 537 [54]; Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) v. De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 243 FLR 28 at 98 [303] - [305] per Simpson J; 

(f)""The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if a sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were"": Wong at 606 [59] (emphasis in the original). For this reason marked difference from sentences imposed in other cases does not of itself justify appellate intervention: Wong at 604 [58]. 

With regard to the last point, it should be borne in mind that the Court is exercising state, not federal, jurisdiction. The statements of principle expressed in De La Rosa, Wong and Hili have to be read bearing that distinction in mind. Section 8 Judicial Officers Act 1986 (NSW) authorises the Judicial Commission to ""disseminate information and reports on sentences imposed by courts"". That dissemination is ""for the purpose of assisting [state] courts to achieve consistency in imposing sentences"". By dint of s.8(2), the section does not limit ""any discretion that a court has in determining a sentence"". And, importantly, ""[c]onsistency is not demonstrated by, and does not require, numerical equivalence"": Hili at 535 [48].

54Bearing these principles in mind, together with the very broad nature of actual criminality covered by s.112(2) Crimes Act, I have derived some benefit, nonetheless, from the consideration of the comparative sentencing information provided by the offender. 

55Of the 1,268 offenders sentenced in the higher courts from October 2003 to September 2010 for offences contrary to s. 112(2) Crimes Act, 67 per cent received a term of imprisonment. Of those offenders sentenced to prison in the period, 53 per cent received a term of three years or less and 47 per cent three years and six months to eight years. Of that latter category, sixteen per cent received between five years and eight years with only one per cent receiving each of seven and eight years. Of offenders with a prior criminal history, including a previous s. 112(2) offence, and who had previously served a custodial sentence, 37 per cent received a sentence of between one year and three years. (62 per cent of that group received three years.) The balance of 63 per cent received terms of imprisonment between three years and six months and eight years. Of this group, three per cent received seven years and one per cent received eight years. These bare statistics relate to the total term of imprisonment. With regard to non-parole periods, 92 per cent of all relevant offenders received a non-parole period of three years or less. More than half of this number received eighteen months or less. Of the eight per cent who received a non-parole period of three years and six months or greater, only one per cent of all offenders received a non-parole period of either five years or six years. Of those offenders with prior convictions including of the same type who had previously been in gaol (admittedly a relatively small group of 115 offenders) 88 per cent received a non-parole period of three years or less. Again, nearly half of that group received a non-parole period of eighteen months or less. 

56Of the 20 prior sentences in the District Court offered as comparable, or at least for comparison, only two involved a sexual element as the circumstance of aggravation. Accordingly, it seems to me that the other eighteen ought to be put to one side from the outset as not involving criminality sufficiently comparable in nature. But it is worthwhile pointing out that these two sexual offenders received the most severe sentences amongst the group of 20. Three other cases involving assault with a weapon came close.

57The first case is R. v. Shillingsworth [2003] NSWCCA 272. The offender had been a member of a party of people drinking at the home of the complainant and her husband. When the party broke up in the early hours of the morning the offender was in something of a stupor and was helped outside the door by the complainant's husband and brother-in-law. They placed the offender on the lawn. When he roused from his sleep, he broke into the complainant's home and sexually assaulted her while she was asleep on her bed beside her husband. The crime involved penetration but no ejaculation, as the complainant and her husband woke interrupting the offender causing him to flee. The offender was an aboriginal man with a chronic alcohol problem and a very deprived and unfortunate background. The sentencing judge found special circumstances and fixed a non-parole period of four years with an additional term of three years, that is a total sentence of imprisonment of seven years. The Court of Criminal Appeal agreed with the primary judge ""that it was very difficult to determine what the correct sentence should be"". The appeal against sentence was dismissed.

58The offender in YS v. R. [2010] NSWCCA 98 was aged sixteen years at the time he committed the offence. The offender broke into the home of the complainant who was then in her mid twenties. He was unknown to her. He threatened the complainant and committed a number of sexual assaults upon her: he digitally penetrated her; he penetrated her with his tongue; he forced her, by pulling her towards him by her hair, to commit an act of fellatio on him. He did not ejaculate. As I have said, the criminality involved physical assault and threats. The offender was of aboriginal descent with a history of family breakdown and drug and alcohol abuse. These crimes were committed in 2002 but the offender was not apprehended until 2008 when, because of his commission of other crimes, police were able to match his DNA with DNA samples obtained at the time of the police investigation of the original offence. In the years prior to his arrest, the offender was diagnosed with a psychotic illness (at the age of eighteen), and went on to commit a number of other offences, including robbery, none of which involved sexual offences. When the offender was sentenced by the District Court he was serving a sentence with a non-parole period still current, and the primary judge commenced the sentence of imprisonment for the subject offence from the conclusion of that non-parole period. The sentencing task was complicated by the fact that the offender suffered from a mental illness at the time of sentencing (if not at the time of the offence), that he was a minor at the time of the offence, and - like the present matter - issues of concurrency, cumulation and totality were involved. A non-parole period of five years was fixed with an additional term of three years (totalling eight years).

59In each of these matters the Court of Criminal Appeal eschewed reliance upon the sentencing statistics. And this sample of two is too small to support any firm conclusion about either patterns or principles to be applied. But I am of the view that the sentencing statistics, permissible as they are under s.8 Judicial Officers Act, and the two examples I have referred to, assist me in concluding that, overall, the sentence here is manifestly excessive.

60In expressing this conclusion, I bear firmly in mind that any range apparent from the statistics, even enhanced by reference to some comparable cases, does not fix the proper range for sentencing. The only proper range is the range fixed by Parliament, which here, having regard to the broad range of criminality encompassed by s.112(2), ranges upwards to 20 years imprisonment. A reference to the comparative information, however, leaves me with the firm impression that the sentence imposed by the primary judge was a very stern one indeed, not that sternness itself bespeaks excess. But when one considers the objective criminality of the offending, accepting that this consideration in the present case should not be either downplayed or understated, one is left with the conclusion that the degree of objective criminality involved in the two specific cases to which I have referred involving actual sexual assault, and in YS attendant physical violence, is much more serious than the criminality involved in the present case.

61It can also be observed that the objective criminality exhibited by the present offending, in the scheme of things, is less serious than those three cases where the aggravating factor was assault with a weapon: in two cases a knife, and in the third a metal pipe. 

62The subjective features of the offender that are required to be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed in the present case, and the offenders in Shillingsworth and YS, are broadly similar. However, I acknowledge that YS was minor when he committed the like offence, and there was evidence before the court that when sentenced he was suffering from mental illness.

63In YS, Rothman J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL (as he then was) and Howie J agreed) referred to the principle of totality at [38] and said (citations omitted):

... the applicant will have served, assuming he is released when first eligible for parole, a period of 6 years and 3 months for two counts of robbery in company, one count of aggravated enter dwelling with intent and one count of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely sexual assault. I do not consider that such a total sentence is inappropriate for the totality of the criminal conduct involved.

64Leaving aside the period of one month on parole in 2009, as at the time the subject offences were committed, if the sentence below remains and the offender is released when he is first eligible (as he was not in respect of the prior offence) he will have served from 12th July 2004 to 24th November 2015, eleven years, four months and twelve days for one offence of aggravated robbery, one offence of destroying property and the present offence of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely indecent assault, always bearing in mind the offences in the Form 1.

65I confess to a feeling of some uneasiness about whether, in fixing the sentence below, the primary judge impermissibly factored in a degree of preventative detention; but I put that to one side for, as I have said, it is not clear how the reference to Veen [No. 2] affected the decision.

66For the aforegoing reasons, I am satisfied that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

67I would also uphold the offender's third ground. To some extent, this is the obverse of ground 1, but it does seem to me that his Honour inverted the process when he came to re-sentence the offender on the 1st of April 2010 by considering the question of accumulation and totality first, and only then re-fixing the sentence: see R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at 67 per Simpson J. Even though, as I have said, Pearce is of particular application when one is sentencing an offender simultaneously for multiple offences, the principles discussed in the passage I have set out at [48] above are of general application, and are certainly applicable when a person serving a current sentence comes before the court for another offence.

Should the Court remit or re-sentence?

68Error has been established in the sentencing process at first instance. In light of the offender's success on the manifest excess issue, in particular, I am of the opinion, in accordance with s.6(3) Appeal Act, that another, lesser, sentence is warranted. This however raises the question whether this Court should remit or re-sentence.

69Ms. Francis argued this Court should exercise it's power under s.12(2) Appeal Act to remit because it does not have all the material necessary for it to re-sentence. She argued that the relevant information included the reasons of his Honour Judge Coorey, which would set out the circumstances of the previous offending and provide information which may therefore be relevant to the questions of concurrency, accumulation and totality. Moreover, the suggestion that mental illness may have been diagnosed could be highly relevant in the manner discussed most recently by the High Court in Muldrock.

70Notwithstanding these matters, I have formed the view that it is in the interests of justice, and of the administration of justice, that this Court proceeds to re-sentence on the information presently available. The subject offences were committed in April 2009. The offender was first sentenced on 4th March 2010 and he has been in custody since 30th April 2009. Admittedly, up until 4th March 2010 his incarceration was solely referrable to the revocation of the parole order in respect of his previous sentence.

71However, it follows that the courts of this State have already considered matters relevant to the appropriate sentence to be served by the offender for the principal offence on three occasions. To remit will engage the resources of the judicial system on a fourth occasion and involve yet further delay in finalising the matter. Delay not only works against finality in litigation, but also will increase the apprehension and anxiety no doubt suffered by the offender. Furthermore, even though I have concluded that a lesser sentence is warranted, there is an aspect of undesirable uncertainty in leaving the process of re-sentencing in abeyance. 

72It is not irrelevant, in this context, to consider that the sentence imposed by Judge Coorey in fact expired on 11th December 2010.

73In so far as marshalling evidence now to bolster the offender's subjective case is concerned, I have formed the view that additional delay for that purpose is not justified. The sentencing judge commented on the absence of a pre-sentence report when the matter was before him on 4th March 2010. Notwithstanding the implicit suggestion, no application for an adjournment was made. Nor was the opportunity taken, when the matter had to be reopened under s.43(2) Sentencing Act, to put further material before the sentencing judge. No additional evidence of a kind frequently seen on the hearing of matters of this type was put before the Court. There is simply no material from which I could infer that additional cogent evidence is available that is likely to make a material difference to the outcome, although I accept implicitly the sincerity of counsel in relaying her instructions to the Court.

74In my judgment, it is far better for all concerned for this Court to re-sentence.

75I remind myself that the principal offence is a serious one, carrying a standard non-parole period of five years and a maximum term of 20 years imprisonment. The objective seriousness of the offence is significant. As the primary judge, with respect, correctly pointed out, the offence involved a degree of premeditation and planning. Although the offender attempted to persuade the complainant to allow him entry to her home, he persisted with his intention of gaining entry, and by force, when she refused and asked him to go away. The offence was clearly sexually motivated. However, on the scale of criminality of offences having a sexual component, connotation or complexion, the instant offence falls short of an actual sexual assault such as was involved in either Shillingsworth or YS. Giving full weight to the fear the complainant must have suffered and the violation of her personal integrity, no actual physical harm or injury was inflicted. It is not irrelevant that the offender desisted and fled when the complainant screamed for help. 

76Obviously the case falls nowhere near a worst category of s.112(2) offence and I would rate it in a lessor category than offences like Shillingsworth, YS and offences involving the infliction of actual, or grievous, bodily harm involving the use of a weapon. 

77The offender's antecedent criminal history and the offences on the Form 1 demonstrate that in his commission of the instant offence, the offender is manifesting a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law, although, as I have said earlier, I would not regard offences having a sexual connotation as characteristic of his prior offending. Nonetheless considerations of retribution, deterrence (both general and personal) and protection of society all indicate that a penalty of some severity is warranted.

78I interpolate that the availability of evidence about a mental illness, or some congenital mental difficulty, would not necessarily make any difference to the outcome. Proof of such a matter may diminish moral culpability and attenuate the consideration of specific deterrence: Veen [No. 2] at 477. But it may at the same time bring the consideration of protection of society into sharper focus.

79I have taken into account that the offender was on conditional liberty when the primary offence was committed, and that as a single woman in her home at night, with a young daughter to worry about, the complainant was in a position of considerable vulnerability.

80Like the primary judge, I think it appropriate to take into account the offender's late plea. Without downplaying the assault, I reiterate that the complainant received no actual physical injury but I am satisfied that she suffered emotional harm. Also, the applicant's unfortunate background, which I have recounted, should be taken into account in his favour.

81For my part, in the exercise of my own discretion in relation to sentencing, unlike his Honour, I would find that there are special circumstances justifying an alteration in the statutory ratio fixed by s.44(2) Sentencing Act. As the offender argued in his written submissions, since turning eighteen years of age on 20th October 1998 ""the offender has spent all but one and a half years of his adult life in gaol"". I set out the table appearing at the foot of page twelve [49] of the written submissions illustrating the point. 





Year

At liberty


1999 - 2000

3 months


2002

34 days (21 days as an escapee)


2003-2004

8 ½ months


2009

1 month

82I appreciate his Honour was not convinced that the offender had become ""institutionalised"" in the absence of expert evidence supporting the offender, but my view differs. The mere recitation of the objective facts satisfies me, although I accept that minds may reasonably differ about this, of a significant degree of institutionalisation. This factor constitutes special circumstances because it loudly bespeaks his clear need for extended, perhaps relatively close, supervision once he is conditionally released into the community: R. v. Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [30] per Howie J.

83Like the primary judge I consider that the commission of the offences on the Form 1, each having a sexual connotation, are a matter of real concern leading to a need to impose a heavier sentence than might have been appropriate otherwise having regard to all other facts, matters and circumstances to which I have referred: Attorney General's Application at 155 [18]-[19] and 159 [42] per Spigelman CJ. 

84The Judicial Commission sentencing statistics and the comparative sentences, which I have already set out in detail, are also relevant. Once again, I acknowledge that care must be taken in the use of them. As Simpson J pointed out in De La Rosa at 71 [305]:

In the end the sentencing discretion is individual: it must be exercised by the individual judge in respect of the individual offender.

85Bearing all these considerations in mind, and allowing a 10% discount for the offender's late plea, the sentence that I consider appropriate to the circumstances of the offence, taking into account the Form 1 offences, and the circumstances of the offender, is one having a non-parole period of three years and ten months (46 months) and, to take account the need for extended supervision, as I have said, an additional term of two years and six months (30 months). The total term of imprisonment is therefore six years and four months.

86I turn then to consider the questions of concurrency, accumulation and totality. I bear in mind that the previous parole was revoked and that at the time he was first sentenced on 4th March 2010, the offender was serving the balance of the term set by Judge Coorey. Other than that the sentence was for an offence of ""aggravated robbery"", nothing is known of the circumstances of that offence. It should be observed again that the offender was not released on parole when he first became eligible for a parole order. Whilst serving that term, he was sentenced to a concurrent term of imprisonment for an offence of destroying, or damaging, property. It can be said however, that from 4th March 2010, when the first sentence of the primary judge was imposed, the offender's previous offending was not the only explanation for his imprisonment. I consider it appropriate to commence the sentence I will impose from that date pursuant to s.47(2)(a) Sentencing Act. This will allow a degree of partial accumulation on the previous sentence, at the same time taking account of the separate criminality involved in the instant offending. 

87Considering the question of totality, the offender will not be eligible for release before 3rd January 2014 and, if it is necessary for him to serve his full term, he will not be released until 3rd July 2016. Leaving aside the one month of conditional liberty in April 2009, this represents, in the event, a minimum overall period of imprisonment of nine years and five months and a maximum overall period of imprisonment of eleven years and eleven months for the offences of aggravated robbery, destroy property and aggravated break, enter and commit indecent assault (taking into account the Form 1 offences). I regard the principle of totality as thereby properly engaged.

88The orders I propose are:

(1)I grant leave to appeal.
(2)Allow the appeal.
(3)Quash the sentence imposed on the applicant by the District Court on 1st April 2010 and instead sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 3 years and 10 months imprisonment taken to have commenced on 4th March 2010 and expiring on 3rd January 2014, with an additional term of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment commencing on 4th January 2014 and expiring on 3rd July 2016; the earliest date for release on parole is therefore 3rd January 2014.

		11 April 2013",2013-04-10 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2419093,R v Mobbs & Dogramaci [2013] NSWDC 103,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: This morning when the trial of Abdullah Dogramaci and Daniel Mobbs was to commence I was told that before the jury could be empanelled I needed to resolve a particular legal issue. That issue concerned the admissibility of a statement made by Mr Mobbs to police at Mount Druitt Police Station on 30 October 2008. (Anyone reading this judgment must understand that the year 2008 is not misprint). The statement was made to police by Mr Mobbs, one of the accused in this trial, in the following circumstances.

2Police went to premises which he leased in Blackett. There were, I gather, a fair few people involved in the execution of a search warrant on those premises. That was because police suspected that there was a drug manufacturing operation taking place at the premises. Thus not only police but also forensic chemists and officers of the New South Wales Fire Brigade were present. Mr Mobbs was not home when police and others arrived. He was telephoned and came to the premises. It is important to bear in mind that shortly after his arrival he was spoken to by police and then arrested. He was cautioned that he need not say anything but he was told that he would be taken back to the police station.

3When he went back to the police station, at some stage someone made a decision that Mr Mobbs would not be interviewed as a suspect of a crime but would be interviewed as a potential witness. So the statement which is the subject of this determination is headed ""Statement of a Witness"". It is on the P190A form which has been around for a long time. 

4In that statement it is agreed that Mr Mobbs makes admissions. The Crown wants to tender that against Mr Mobbs in the current trial but Ms Mikhaiel who appears for Mr Mobbs objects, saying that the provisions of s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act require its rejection. 

5It is clear that when Mr Mobbs left Blackett heading to the police station at least one police officer regarded him as being a suspect. That is there was a reasonable suspicion in the mind of the officer who arrested him and that reasonable suspicion seems to have been shared by other officers as well.

6The Crown has tendered some material on this application but what is immediately obvious as being missing is any evidence from the person who made the decision to interview Mr Mobbs as a witness rather than a suspect. There is some hearsay evidence of relevance in the statement of Detective Inspector Iorfino. In paragraph 17 of that statement this appears, I will quote the entirety of that paragraph.

""I recall during the day having conversations with Detective Sergeant Gordon in respect of the accused (he means Mr Mobbs). I recall that the accused was not charged with the offence relating to the manufacture of prohibited drugs at Blackett and had provided a statement. From my discussions with Detective Sergeant Gordon the decision to take this course of action on this date was that the requisite knowledge of the accused about the manufacture had not been clearly established at the time he was in custody. It was deemed appropriate that a further review be conducted of the available evidence before preferring the charge against the accused to determine whether he had committed an offence or was a witness relevant to investigation. At the time the accused was in custody on 30 October 2008 it was determined that the accused would be treated as a witness until a review of the evidence was obtained.""


7So it seems to be that it was Detective Sergeant Gordon who made the decision to treat Mr Mobbs as a witness rather than a suspect but para 17 which I have just quoted is very informative. It confirms, what is fairly clear from other evidence, that Mr Mobbs remained a suspect even as the statement was taken from him. It may well have been that ""the requisite knowledge of the accused about the manufacture had not been clearly established at the time he was in custody"" but the need for there to be ""a further review...of the available evidence before preferring a charge"" shows that he was still a suspect. Further investigations were needed to either confirm the suspicion or allay it.

8It is clear that police had not yet decided whether or not to charge him but is equally clear that they still had a suspicion that he had committed an offence. Paragraph 17 is of great assistance to Mr Mobbs on this application. 

9There is no rule that says that every electronically recorded interview has to be followed by an accused being charged. It was of course appropriate for police in Mr Mobbs' case, suspected as he was at all stages of having committed an offence, to be interviewed electronically. If during the course of that electronic interview Mr Mobbs had provided some exculpatory explanation which meant that he was no longer a suspect then the result would have been that he was not charged. 

10Section 281 contains a number of criteria which set out the admissions to which the section applies. Of relevance to the present application is the question of whether Mr Mobbs was or could reasonably have been suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence. 

11The Crown conceded that Mr Mobbs could reasonably have been suspected, by an investigating official, of having committed an offence because of the content of some telephone intercepts which concerned calls made before Mr Mobbs' arrest. Thus, said Mr Crown, the issue as to whether the statement was admissible against Mr Mobbs depends on whether there is a reasonable excuse for not electronically recording what Mr Mobbs said. The reasonable excuse said the Crown was that the police who made the decision not to interview Mr Mobbs electronically did not know about the content of the telephone calls. 

12But I am prepared to make this decision ignoring the content of the telephone calls. The evidence was that Mr Mobbs rented premises and occupied premises where there was a drug laboratory on those premises. There was a locked door inside the house. There were items consistent with drug manufacture or at least supply in the living areas of the house. In those circumstances Mr Mobbs was clearly a suspect and indeed, as I have tried to make clear, he was suspected of having committed a crime by investigating officials. That means that any admissions made by him needed to be electronically recorded unless a reasonable excuse can be established. That is where the Crown falls down.

13Ms Mikhaiel did tell me earlier that she was prepared to make a submission that a reasonable excuse can only be one of the three identified circumstances referred to in the definition. Notwithstanding that there is some authority suggesting the accuracy of that submission it is a submission I would have rejected, and fairly quickly rejected, had it been necessary to consider it. The word 'includes' is a word which appears throughout legislation in New South Wales and rarely if ever is it construed as meaning 'includes and only includes'. The whole history of s 281 makes it clear that those three circumstances were never meant to cover the field of what might be a reasonable excuse. 

14The Crown's claim that the reasonable excuse was provided by the circumstance that investigating police did not know about the telephone calls falls by the wayside when it is realised that those telephone calls have nothing do with the suspicion police actually held on the day Mr Mobbs was arrested. The Crown has not managed to demonstrate a reasonable excuse for failing to electronically record the admission and so that statement will not be admitted in the trial.

		12 July 2013",2013-04-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2419146,Enders v Erbas & Associates Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2013] NSWDC 44,"Judgment

Introduction

1The plaintiff brings proceedings for defamation against two defendants, Erbas & Associates Pty Ltd, a consulting engineering company with approximately 20 employees, and Mr Ken Erbas, the managing director of the company.

2The matter complained of is an email dated 5 July 2010, the text of which is set out in paragraph 6 below, sent by the defendants to its employees, including the plaintiff, who at the time was employed by the first defendant as a mechanical design draftsman. Attached to the email is an extract from the first defendant's electronic work diary for the period 31 May to 11 July 2010. The plaintiff is not named or otherwise specifically referred to in the email's text, but her name appears in 18 entries in the attached electronic diary. These documents must read together.

3The defendants conceded the defamatory meaning of each imputation pleaded, if conveyed. The imputations pleaded by the plaintiff are:

(a)The plaintiff is a malingerer.

(b)The plaintiff unjustifiably took time off work by falsely pretending she was sick.

(c)The plaintiff does not act fairly to her employer.

(d)By unjustifiably taking time off work the plaintiff does not act fairly to other staff.

(e)The plaintiff hurts management in the running of projects by unjustifiably absenting herself from work. 

The matter complained of

4I shall first briefly describe the parties, the matter complained of, and to whom it was sent. The matter complained of is an email sent to all staff members on an electronic mailing list, namely all the employees of the first defendant. It contains an extract from the first defendant's office electronic diary, access to which, like the email, was limited to the employees of the first defendant. (The entire electronic diary from for 2012, which can only be read on the first defendant's computer equipment, was not discovered by the defendants until the day before the hearing, and the plaintiff objected to its tender.) 

5The first defendant's electronic office diary was accessible to all staff through their office computers. Staff consulted it to add in, or check, their own and/or other staff absences on sick leave and holiday leave, as well as late arrivals to (or early departures from) the office. Meetings outside the office and use of office cars or other valuable equipment (e.g. cameras) were similarly recorded, either by staff themselves, or by the receptionist, Ms Montemayor.

6On Monday July 5, 2010, the second defendant, according to this diary, had to attend a meeting outside the office. He did not do so. Instead, he sent the matter complained of, in the form of an email with an attachment from the diary, to all the first defendant's employees:

""To All,

In one month, I quickly counted 24 sick days, 21 latecomers and 26 days of holidays as attached. This is the equivalent of 3 people not here continuously throughout the month. This also means that the rest of the people here will be doing their jobs so that we can produce adequate [sic] to pay everyone's salary.

This is not fair to the company and the ones who come on time every time. We will be looking at this very seriously in the next [sic] days. It costs us big dollars per day of productivity. This is not acceptable.

Today only, 5 people sick and 1 on holidays. It hurts management to run the projects.

We will talk about this at our first [sic] staff meeting."" 

7The attached extract from the electronic office diary for the period Monday 31 May to Friday 11 July 2010 contained entries setting out each day on which staff members came to work late, were off sick, or on holidays. Mr Erbas circled these entries with a yellow electronic highlighter (one or two entries were missed, or wrong, but it was not put to me that anything turned on this). This is the data upon which the calculations referred to in the email above are based. 17 of the 24 sick days were taken by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had no absences from work on holiday leave out of the 26 holiday leave entries. The plaintiff was 1 of the 21 latecomer entries noted in this diary extract.

8The ""staff meeting"" referred to in the matter complained of was a regular part of office management (it was accepted by both parties that the reference to ""first"" in the final line of this email should be read as ""first available"", or ""next""). These meetings were occasions for management and staff to highlight problems the company was having. The second defendant was largely responsible for the agenda. Issues regularly discussed included productivity and lateness.

Particular features of the matter complained of

9The following features of the matter complained of may be noted:

(a)The plaintiff is not referred to specifically in the email but in the attached electronic diary extract, a publication the accuracy for which the staff members were responsible (T 87, 102), in that they could put the entries in themselves. This means that the plaintiff played, or could play, a role in either authorising or actually publishing entries in relation to herself as to any absences, holidays, late arrivals and the like. Every one of the office staff who received the matter complained of was able to add entries in this fashion. This means that the plaintiff and the defendants were not only all recipients of the matter complained of, but also took part either in publishing or authorising the office electronic diary (Tobin & Sexton, Australian Defamation Law and Practice at [5012]; Trantum v McDowell (2007) NSWCA 138 at [45]ff; David v Abdishou [2012] NSWCA 109 at [385] ff). In addition, the fact that this is an intra-company communication raises the issues discussed by Giles JA in State Bank of NSW Ltd v Currabubula Holdings Pty Ltd (2001) 51 NSWLR 399 at [12]] but, as publication issues were dealt with in an informal application in the Defamation List, I was not addressed on these issues, and need only note them.

(b)The imputations are asserted to arise by inference from the sheer number of times that the plaintiff's name was circled (17 times out of 24) in relation to sick leave. The plaintiff's name was not the only one circled, although it was the most frequently circled for sick leave. There were many other staff absences, and the reasons for all of these are noted in the diary. The diary was for the weeks immediately prior, and including, the week it was published. This was thus a publication to each member of a group of about 20 staff members where the complaint related to recent absences from work by members of that group, which means there is a context of prior knowledge by recipients of the content of the diary, office procedure and personal knowledge of the events in question.

(c)An additional claim of ""republication"" by the plaintiff is brought for publications by her to friends and to medical staff: Jones v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd (1991) 23 NSWLR 364. This artificial and poorly drafted claim added to the complexities of the legal issues and evidence.

The issues in these proceedings

10The issues in these proceedings are:

(1)The nature and extent of the publication and whether the imputations pleaded are conveyed and defamatory.

(2)Whether any of the defences (qualified privilege at common law and pursuant to s 30 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) (""the Act"") and the defence of unlikelihood of harm pursuant to s 33) are made out. Although the publication describes the conduct of those criticised as ""not fair"", and similar wording is picked up in two of the imputations, no defence of honest opinion is pleaded.

(3)Damages.

11I shall deal first with issues relevant to publication and republication.

The role of disputed issues of fact in the determination of issues of publication and defamatory meaning

12It is not uncommon for there to be disputed issues of fact about identification or context in relation to meaning; evidence of this kind was not unfrequently called at s 7A jury trials under the repealed legislation (Defamation Act 1974 (NSW)). However, the disputed issues of fact alleged to be relevant to publication and identification, such as whether or not the recipients of the publication knew the reasons for the plaintiff's absences on sick leave, were not identified or defined with precision by either party to the litigation (cf. Morgan v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1990) 20 NSWLR 511 at 517, 526 and 538-40).

13The plaintiff first challenged, as to publication and meaning, as well as to the defences, whether the reason for her frequent absences (about one week in three, prior to the matter complained of) noted as ""sick"" leave in the office diary, would have been known to the recipients. The plaintiff's evidence was she only told the second defendant, Mrs Erbas (the second defendant's wife), Mr Parissis, Mr Martin and Ms Montemayor (T 13, 57 and 58) that she was having treatment for breast cancer. She denied telling other staff members. The plaintiff also challenged the accuracy of the work electronic diary, asserting that some of the days she is noted as ""off sick"" were days on which she had been told to stay home by management when she was well enough to work. This evidence, and the fact that the second defendant was noted as being out of the office at a meeting at the time he was writing the matter complained of, was submitted to be evidence that the diary was not accurate. 

14Errors in the matter complained of, or the knowledge of the recipients of the reason for the plaintiff's sick leave absences, may arguably be relevant to context, and thus to meaning: Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 1528; Palace Films v John Fairfax [2012] NSWSC 1136. Mr Evatt submitted that I should accept the plaintiff's evidence that the reasons for her ill-health were not widely known and that, even if they were, lack of precise information would mean imputations of ""malingerer"" and unjustifiable absences from work were conveyed. However, the parties' submissions did not delineate the relationship (if any) between these disputed issues of fact and issues of publication and meaning. 

15I have made findings about all disputed facts, as they are relevant to the defences. I have not applied these findings of fact to the determination of meaning, firstly because of the failure to plead any such extrinsic or disputed facts, and secondly because I have made factual findings contrary to the plaintiff's assertions. While the matter complained of was published to persons with extensive knowledge of the factual background, it must ultimately speak for itself, in terms of what meanings are conveyed. 

Extent of Publication

16Issues of publication need to be dealt with before I can determine capacity and defamatory meaning, because of the manner in which publication has been pleaded and particularised. 

17The statement of claim states that these imputations were published to all employees of the first defendant, who are named in the particulars set out in the statement of claim, with the proviso that further particulars as to the identity of the persons to whom the matter complained of would be provided after discovery and interrogatories. This suggests such additional persons would be persons then unknown to the plaintiff. No such claim has, however, been made.

18As to liability for publication, the plaintiff does not differentiate between the defendants. During the trial the defendants conceded that no challenge would be made as to any vicarious liability issues in relation to the first defendant. Publication of the email by the defendants to the first defendant's employees on 5 July 2010 is a straightforward issue. 

19However, there is a claim of additional publications made, not by the defendants, but by the plaintiff, headed ""Particulars of Republication (Bracks v Smythe-Kirk [sic])"", which was added to the second further amended statement of claim filed following informal argument on issues apparently relating either to identification or publication before Elkaim SC DCJ on 7 October 2011. These particulars recite that the defendants are liable for the plaintiff's ""involuntary publications which were the natural and probable consequence of the defendants' initial publication"". Four publications of this kind are identified:

(a)The plaintiff was ""compelled to show a copy to her friends Gabrielle Link and Joanne Hill so as to obtain their support and comfort and to her foster son Tom McAuley (aged 21) and his girlfriend Maggieanne Stephenson"";

(b)The plaintiff was ""so upset by the material [sic] complained of she was compelled to contact the NSW Cancer Council and told them about the email"";

(c)The plaintiff also ""told her oncologist"", her two chemotherapy nurses ""about the email""; and

(d)The plaintiff told a friend named Boris Katic ""about the email"". The purpose, in the case of Mr Katic, was to obtain his ""comfort and support"". There is no explanation in the pleading for the reason for telling the other unnamed persons.

20No date is given in the amended pleading as to when these publications were made, although according to the evidence it was some time prior to September 2010 (T 40 - 41), more than a year before these additional publications (or republications) were incorporated into the pleadings. Any claim of publication (or republication) needs to be specific as to time and within the limitation period (see Emmerton v University of Sydney [1969] 1 NSWR 83; Ahmed v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 676), but no limitation issue has been raised by the defendants. If these are additional claims for ""republication"" of a defamation (cf. Jones v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd (1991) 23 NSWSC 364), as opposed to matters going to assessment of damages, they have not been properly pleaded: Bracks v Denoon (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Nicholas J, 14 December 2006).

21In relation to the ""republication"" particulars referred to above, the statement of claim (as amended on 7 October 2011) sets out that the plaintiff said the following words on each of these occasions:

""My employer has sent an email to everyone at work. He says I'm a malingerer, that I'm faking my illness to take time off, that as a result I'm not being fair to him and my co-workers and I'm hurting management running projects. I don't understand. It is so unfair. They know I have cancer. They approved me taking time off to get treatment. I told them I wanted to keep working but they said take the time off.""

22The plaintiff was not asked about these statements about each of the ""republications"" in examination in chief. Mr Evatt, after the plaintiff's evidence in chief, conceded (T 54) he did not press this claim in relation to Ms Link or Ms Hill (see the particular set out at 19(a) above) or to the NSW Cancer Council (see particular 19(b) above). This would leave the publication to Ms Stephenson and Mr McAuley (see particular 19(a) above) and to the unnamed persons in particulars 19(c) and 19(d) above. 

23The plaintiff was cross-examined as follows:

""Q. Now when you told these people about the statement of claim in this case says that you spoke to some people. They're set in paragraph 11 of the second further amended statement of claim, and it says that you told people ""My employer has sent an email to everyone at work. He says I'm a malingerer"" Is that what you told these people; did you use that word ""malingerer:?
A. I probably used yeah I might have used the word malingerer, bludger. It all means the same thing. Slacker.

Q. Well you go onto say, ""that I'm faking my illness to take time off"" is that what you told these people?
A. That that's what it felt like. I was made to feel like I was faking my illness to take time off.

Q. Well it says in the second further amended statement of claim at paragraph 11 that that's what ""my employer has said. He says I'm a malingerer"". He never said that did he?
A. Well that's what the email suggests.

Q. That's what it suggests but you say you told these people that's what he said, is that right?
A. I told these I showed these people the email.

Q. They all saw the email did they?
A. Yes.

Q. And they all knew that you had cancer didn't they?
A. Who is ""they""?

Q. All the people that you showed the email to. That is, the ones we've just discussed, your friends and family, the nurses and the doctor?
A. I didn't show the nurses the email.

Q. They [sic] didn't show the nurses the email?
A. No.

Q. So did you tell the nurses then that he says, ""I'm a malingerer""?
A. Yes.

Q. And ""Faking my illness""?
A. Yes.

Q. That's not what he said was it?
A. Well that's what the email suggests.

Q. And they all knew you were
A. and that's what I felt
Q. Sorry. Are you finished? That's what you felt?
A. Mmhmm.

Q. Now they all knew that you were sick didn't they?
A. The nurses, yes.

Q. And your friends and family knew that you were sick?
A. Yes.

Q. So that it wasn't an unjustified sickness, was it? Sorry, it wasn't an unjustified absence of leave?
A. No.

Q. And they knew that didn't they?
A. Yep. They knew I had cancer if that's what you're asking.

Q. And they knew that when, if they were told ""that the boss has sent an email to everyone at work and he says I'm a malinger and I'm faking my illness"" they knew that wasn't true didn't they?
A. Of course they knew that wasn't true.

Q. Of course they knew that wasn't true, is that correct?
A. Yeah."" (T 126-127)

24The circumstances of each of these publications being made involved the plaintiff negating the content of the email, if the email was shown (for example, it would appear that it was not shown to the ""nurses"" at all). It is unclear whether the diary extract was also shown on each occasion. The plaintiff's explanatory words form part of the matter complained of. In those few instances where the recipient actually received the whole of the matter complained of to read, there would be a question of bane and antidote.

25Some of the recipients (Ms Stephenson (T 189-190), Mr Kotic (T 147-150), Ms Link (T 140-146)) gave evidence about these occasions. The few details which emerged in the evidence of these witnesses were inconsistent with the particulars of publication provided in the statement of claim; for example, contrary to what was particularised, Ms Stephenson said she did not see the email (T 191), whereas Mr Katic, identified in the statement of claim as someone who did not see the email, claimed he did (T 148). 

26There are two problems with these additional claims. The first raises the same difficulty as occurred in Miller v Associated Newspapers Ltd [2012] EWHC 3721 (QB) at [121], where the plaintiff pleaded publication by other newspapers as a repetition of the sting, either as separate matters complained of, or by way of damages. In Miller, the publications were in writing, but the claim suffered from the same vice as the plaintiff's claim in these proceedings, namely that neither the words of the matter complained of, nor the meanings which the plaintiff pleaded as arising, were identified with the precision necessary for a publication the subject of defamation proceedings.

27Sharp J concluded:

""First, Mr Miller relies on repetition of the sting complained of in 5 subsequent articles published in the Daily Mail. Whether it is legitimate do so is a matter of some debate. In Collins Stewart v Financial Times Ltd [2006] EMLR 5 at [26] and [27] Gray J expressed the view that there were sound reasons of principle and practice why a claimant should pursue a separate complaint in respect of subsequent articles rather than relying on them in aggravation of damages. The editors of Duncan and Neill on Defamation (3rd edition) on the other hand after referring to that decision, submit that if a claimant were to seek to rely upon later publications as aggravating the damages (rather than by way of separate causes of action) the court would decide what is required to do justice between the parties, using its case management powers. It seems to me as a minimum that normally the words complained of should be specified, if not actually set out, as should the meaning which the claimant says should be attributed to them. The practical difficulty is that this wasn't done here though the Defendant said in its defence that Mr Miller should do so. Further, as Mr Warby pointed out, there was no reconsideration of this part of the claim following the ruling on meaning; and the Defendant does not accept these articles bear the meaning the Article bears. I do not think the answer is as Mr Barca suggested that the Defendant did not apply to strike out this part of the claim, since the onus is on the claimant to make good a claim in aggravation of damages. I have concluded therefore that I should focus as did the parties, on the Article, and the damages flowing from its publication.""

28The second problem is whether publications of this kind can be considered to be ""republications"" at all. In State Bank of NSW Ltd v Currabubula Holdings Pty Ltd (20010 51 NSWLR 399 at [106] Giles JA explains Hunt J's analysis (Jones v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd (1991) 23 NSWLR 364) of the very limited circumstances of liability by a defendant for a publication made by a plaintiff, noting with approval Hunt J's statement that publication, rather than republication, was the correct terminology.

29It is common for plaintiffs and their family members or friends to give evidence of the hurt to feelings the plaintiff suffered when a defamatory publication is made. To elevate these discussions to a claim of fresh publication, for which damages may be claimed, is novel (Toomey v John Fairfax & Sons Limited (1985) 1 NSWLR 291 at 293) and should be possible only in the very limited circumstances explained by Hunt J in Jones, and by Giles JA in Currabubula, supra.. 

30The parties' submissions do not address the issue of whether these were claims for liability, quantum or simply hurt to feelings. I propose, in the absence of clear pleadings and appropriate submissions, to adopt the same approach as Sharp J did in Miller, namely to focus upon the matter complained of which was circulated by email to the employees of the first defendant, and to regard the circumstances in which the plaintiff sought comfort from her friends and those responsible for her medical treatment, which included telling them about (or showing them) the matter complained of, as being relevant only going to the plaintiff's hurt to feelings.

31In the event that I have erred in this finding, I have included a consideration, in relation to each of the defences pleaded, for these additional publications.

32Having determined the nature and extent of the publication as being the email of 5 July 2010 which was circulated electronically to the plaintiff and her fellow employees, I now consider the issue of whether the imputations pleaded by the plaintiff are conveyed and defamatory. 

The imputations conveyed by the matter complained of

33The general principles in relation to distilling meaning from an alleged defamatory publication have been settled law for many years in most common law jurisdictions. Brown on Defamation: Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States, 2nd ed., (Carswell) at [5.1] (footnotes omitted) broadly outlines these principles as follows:

""Words, in order to be actionable, must be understood in a defamatory sense. In construing the language used, a court would avoid any forced or unreasonable interpretation. Words will generally be given their ordinary meaning unless they have some special, technical or colloquial meaning and would be understood in that sense by those to whom they were published. The defamatory meaning must be one which would be understood by reference to an ordinary and reasonable person, and not a meaning by someone who may be naturally inclined either to attribute the best or worst meaning to words published about the plaintiff. In determining the meaning to be attributed to the words, the court will take into consideration all the circumstances of the case including any reasonable implications the words may bear, the context in which the words were spoken, the audience to whom they were published and the manner in which they were presented. It is not necessary for the persons to whom the words were publish to understand them in a defamatory sense if a reasonable person would do so. The fact that the defendant did not intend to defame the plaintiff, or had a honest belief in the truth of his or her communication, or was moved by the most laudable of motives, is no defence if, in fact, the words defamed the plaintiff.""

34These general principles had been the subject of refinement in a series of Australian decisions (Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 at 164-167; Griffith v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 300 at [19]-[20]; Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 79 ALJR 1716; Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton (2009) 238 CLR 460), in relation to both the repealed legislation and the Uniform Defamation Act, as explained in Tobin & Sexton, Australian Defamation Law & Practice (LexisNexis) at [4,001]-[4,300]. This task is ""a matter of law for the court"" (Stubbs Ltd v Russell [1913] AC 386 at 393), and not an issue of disputed fact. The correct approach of the judge at the trial (as opposed to the approach to an application to strike out the imputations as a summary matter) is helpfully summarised by Nicholas J in Korean Times v Pak [2011] NSWCA 365 at [56]-[76]. In Korean Times v Pak, as was the case here, the defendants challenged the capacity of all imputations pleaded to arise.

35The defendants' submissions assert that each of the imputations neither expressly nor impliedly conveys any of the stings (at [3.11], [3.15], [3.18], [3.24], [3.28]) as the publication ""does not state"" (at [3.10], [3.11]) these matters, or ""expressly"" refer to the plaintiff ([3.16]). As Nicholas J explains in Korean Times v Pak, supra, and Tobin & Sexton point out at [4,100], the meaning conveyed to the ordinary reasonable reader by a publication, and its defamatory nature, may be a matter of impression. It is not necessary to analyse to the last word all that goes to create that impression (Gorton v Australian Broadcasting Commission (1973) 1 ACTR 6 at 12 per Fox J). It is sufficient for the plaintiff to establish that it is more likely than not that such a meaning was conveyed to the reader even though ""a lawyer or someone skilled in formal logic could have explained to the ordinary man that there were other possibilities"" (Gorton v Australian Broadcasting Commission, supra, at 12).

36As previously noted, the plaintiff's submissions on capacity refer to the inaccuracy of notations as to the plaintiff being absent (31 May - 6 June) when she was fit to work is relevant to the issue of meaning: cf Korean Times v Pak, supra, at [67] - [70]. In addition, it was claimed that only a few of the recipients knew that the plaintiff had cancer, and that this was relevant to the imputation of malingering. Findings on disputed issues of fact are generally irrelevant to the issue of defamatory meaning, and the plaintiff's submissions to the contrary (written submissions, [12]) do not specify how these errors cause defamatory meanings to arise. In any event, as is set out in more detail in my findings of fact, I am satisfied that the office diary was intended to be, and was, accurate in that the entries in relation to the plaintiff were correctly made and that ""errors"" in the diary (such as the second defendant not being at the 5 July meeting) are irrelevant to the issues in this case.

37The submissions of the plaintiff about what the ordinary reasonable reader would make of the publication contain a number of value judgments (such as the assertion that even those who knew the plaintiff had cancer would think she was malingering, or that Mr Erbas must have known something about the plaintiff that the staff members did not). The rhetorical question is asked: ""Why else would Mr Erbas circle her name 17 times for sickness"" (written submissions, [19]), when the real reason for her absence was, the plaintiff claims, because Mr Parissis prevented her from coming to work, even though she was fit to work.

38Although these opinions are attributed by the plaintiff's submissions to the ordinary reasonable reader, they in fact reflect what the plaintiff complained about in her evidence of hurt to feelings. The understanding of the defamatory matter by the plaintiff, or by the person or persons to whom it was published, is irrelevant to the issue of meaning. As Tobin & Sexton explain at [4,060], ""there is no place in the law of defamation for the egg-shell thin ego. A plaintiff may be particularly, indeed more morbidly, sensitive to criticism of himself. The fact that he understands a publication in a particular defamatory sense is in no way probative of whether he has been defamed."" The test is one of the ordinary reasonable reader: Korean Times v Pak, supra at [56]. 

39Both parties agreed that a significant impact upon the capacity of the matter complained of to convey the imputations can be made by the mode or manner of publication (Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 at 161; Channel Seven Adelaide Pty Ltd v S, DJ [2006] SASC 10 at [15]). The context of the publication is also an important issue to take into account. Professor Brown at [5.3(1)(a)] explains:

""Particular attention will be given to the time when the words are read or heard, to the mode or manner of the publication, and to the community in which they are published. If the defamatory meaning is latent and depends upon the existence of extrinsic facts to be understood in a defamatory sense, the plaintiff must prove that the persons to whom the words were published were aware of those facts."" [Emphasis added].

40The context may be provided by the publication itself. For example, in Un Dok Pak Nicholas J took into account, when determining meaning, that the article was short, and the headline, photograph and opening paragraph all referred to the plaintiff. The ordinary reasonable reader's impression that the conduct being investigated by the ICAC was that of the plaintiff was thereby conveyed. 

41However, factors outside the publication may also have a bearing, such as the relationship between the publisher and recipient (e.g. Barach v University of New South Wales [2011] NSWSC 99 - conversation between two academics). In the present case where the close relationship between the plaintiff and the recipients arose from the fact that they all worked in the same office, this relationship may have some background significance as context in relation to the meanings pleaded.

42The ordinary reasonable reader does not parse and analyse the publication for strained meanings. At [5.3(1)(b)], Professor Brown cites the warning of Mason J in O'Malley v O'Callaghan (1992) 1 Alta LR (3d) 88 at 91 (QB) that ""[t]he danger to be avoided is the dissection of an overall inoffensive whole into incriminating fragments"". That warning is of particular relevance here; under no circumstances would the ordinary reasonable reader sit down and add up the number of absences for the plaintiff or indeed other employees; and I have not done so here. As Giles JA explained in State Bank of New South Wales Ltd v Currabubula Holdings Pty Ltd (2001) 51 NSWLR 399 at 404, ""it is the broad impression which counts"", not a factual analysis, and I have been carefully guided by these principles of ""broad impression"" in relation to each of the imputations pleaded.

Application of these principles to the matter complained of

43The plaintiff submits each of the imputations arises (written submissions, [10]) firstly because pages 2, 4, 5 and 7 of the electronic diary contain the plaintiff's name, which repeatedly is circled in yellow, and secondly because although the other employees' names are circled, her name is circled so many times for sick days. The plaintiff summarises the sting of the email as accusing ""those who had the 24 sick days, those who were the 21 latecomers and those who had 26 days of holiday"" as ""not fair to the company and the ones who come on time every time"" (written submissions, [11]). This is reinforced by the reference: ""Today only, 5 people sick and 1 on holidays.""

44The defendants have addressed me only on whether each imputation is conveyed; if conveyed, they rely on the defences of common law qualified privilege, statutory qualified privilege and triviality (written submissions, paragraph 1.4). The defendants have not submitted that the imputations, if conveyed, are incapable of being defamatory (the principles for which are discussed in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Obeid [2005] NSWCA 60). 

Imputation (a) - The plaintiff is a malingerer

45The plaintiff submits that the ordinary reasonable reader was entitled to distil the meaning that the persons who had sick days, latecomers and staff on holiday were all acting deliberately against company interests. They were ""not fair"" both to ""the company"" and ""to the ones who come on time every time"". The five staff members away sick (and one on holiday) on 5 July were ""hurting management"". When added to the fact that the plaintiff's name was circled 17 times, this would mean that even those who knew the plaintiff was sick with cancer would think that the plaintiff was well enough to work and should have turned up for work to the office, and that her failure to do so was ""malingering or unjustifiably taking time off work by falsely pretending her sickness was more debilitative than it was"" (written submissions, [19]). This was why Mr Erbas circled her name 17 times - not because her name occurred 17 times, but to make this point.

46This is not the correct approach to analysis of the matter complained of. The correct approach is that taken by Nicholas J in Korean Times v Pak, supra. 

47The matter complained of is addressed ""To All"", and attaches an extract from the electronic diary kept by staff for the purpose of recording their absences from the office. With one exception (the reference to the 5 persons away sick, and 1 on holiday, on 5 July) no specific incidents are referred to. The plaintiff's name is not the only one circled; every absence from the office has been circled and added into the calculations referred to in the opening paragraph of the matter complained of.

48The language and structure of the matter complained of make it clear that the complaint is addressed to all staff, not just those whose names are circled, and that the problem is an ongoing one, not something limited to the time period for the electronic diary. The ordinary reasonable reader would infer that this is the problem which the defendants want addressed at the next staff meeting, not failure by one or more employees to attend work when they should. The problem is one of timing clashes, not misuse of holiday or sick leave, or tardy arrivals for no reason, and it involves the whole office; the diary extract is attached as an example. The issue, as the 5 July reference makes clear, is one of coordination and planning, and a topic to ""talk about"" at the next staff meeting.

49The ordinary reasonable reader with no knowledge of anyone's reasons for absence beyond what is in the matter complained of would not assume, without more, that the reasons for the plaintiff's many absences was that she was malingering as opposed to being away sick for the reason stated. This imputation is pitched too high, and is not conveyed. 

50If I have erred in my rejection of the special meanings Mr Evatt asserts arose because other employees did not know she had cancer, this pleaded meaning would similarly not be conveyed.

51I note that, if this imputation were conveyed, it would be defamatory.

Imputation (b) - The plaintiff unjustifiably took time off work by falsely pretending she was sick

52This is the imputation of an ""act"" which a plaintiff may plead in addition to an imputation of a ""condition"" (Singleton v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 20 February 1980)). 

53For the same reasons that I have found that imputation (a) is not conveyed, imputation (b) is not conveyed. There is nothing in the matter complained of to support and imputation that the plaintiff falsely pretended to be sick.

54I note that, if this imputation were conveyed, it would be defamatory.

Imputation (c) - The plaintiff does not act fairly to her employer

55The defendants argue that not only is this imputation not conveyed, but that the matter complained of does not reveal how the plaintiff is said to have acted unfairly to her employer. However, the conduct that is ""not fair"" (line 35) is that the plaintiff's absences are contributing to the equivalent of three people not being in the office continuously throughout the month. That means that those who ""come on time every time"" suffer, as does the company, as this conduct ""cost us big dollars per day of productivity"". The plaintiff is one of the persons identified in a class. In addition, she is one of the five persons who was sick on the day in question. As her absence on leave ""hurts management"", such conduct is clearly identifiable.

56The ordinary reasonable reader would have no difficulty identifying the plaintiff, particularly since she is one of the ""five people sick"" whose conduct ""hurts management"" and is ""not fair"".

57This imputation is conveyed and defamatory.

Imputation (d) - By unjustifiably taking time off work, the plaintiff does not act fairly to other staff

58The key word in this imputation is ""unjustifiably"". If the plaintiff had been a regular latecomer, or in some way conducted herself ""unjustifiably"", as opposed to being away on sick leave, this imputation would be, to the ordinary reasonable reader, capable of arising. 

59The defendants submit that the ordinary reasonable reader would think that at least some of the people on the calendar were genuinely sick. I agree with this submission. However, I do not agree with the conclusion that the defendants draw (written submissions, paragraph 3.25) that ""in the absence of an expressed reference to the plaintiff"" this imputation is not conveyed. The generalised impression of the sheer number of times that the plaintiff's name is circled is such as to give raise to the imputation that the plaintiff's absences from work, whether those reasons are fair or not, are unjustifiable. 

60The unjustifiable nature of the absence is that it is taken at a time when others are also absent, not that the absence itself was unjustified. Reading the matter complained of as a whole, the general objection is that the level of absenteeism, however good the reasons may be, is unjustified as a whole, and that this is not fair to the staff who are at work on time, every time.

61This imputation is conveyed and defamatory.

Imputation (e) - The plaintiff hurts management in the running of projects by unjustifiably absenting herself from work 

62The imputation conveyed very clearly in the second paragraph of the email is that the high level of absenteeism is ""not fair to the company"" and that it ""hurts management"" (paragraph 3 of the email). This is referable to the plaintiff as she was one of the five people off sick on the day referred to. This imputation differs from the imputation of unfairness to other staff (imputation (d)).

63Again, this is a ""group libel"" case where the objection is to the conduct of more than one member of staff. While the precise parameters of the class may be difficult to delineate, the ""five people sick and one on holidays"" on 5 July, which would include the plaintiff, is clearly identified as one of those ""hurting"" the company by the many circled absences she had taken on sick leave.

64This imputation is conveyed and defamatory.

Conclusions concerning imputations

65I have found imputations (c), (d) and (e) to be conveyed. I have, however, in relation to the defences, noted what my findings would have been had I found that imputations (a) and (b) were also conveyed. I have also noted what my findings would be in relation to each of the asserted ""republications"", assuming that each of those republications was capable of conveying some or all of the imputations pleaded.

The defences

66The defences pleaded are qualified privilege at common law, qualified privilege pursuant to s 30 of the Act, and a defence under s 33 of the Act. I shall first set out the circumstances leading to publication of the matter complained of.

Factual background

67The plaintiff was employed by the first defendant as a mechanical design draftsperson (T 207). The first defendant was set up in 1997 (T 206). At the time it was a consulting engineering company providing engineering design and drafting services to builders, architects and developers. Until 2008 the first defendant provided mechanical engineering services only, and subcontracted hydraulic and electrical engineering work (T 207). Following the global financial crisis, the first defendant changed its direction and became a multi-disciplinary engineering company in 2008 (T 207) and the number of mechanical engineers and design draftsmen decreased.

68There were 12 mechanical engineers employed in 2008 (T 208) but by the end of 2009 the number of mechanical engineers and design draftsmen had decreased to 6 from redundancies and resignations (T 208, 214 and 215). The plaintiff's position as a mechanical design draftsperson was affected by these changes, although she did not know it at the time (T 216-217). A decision was taken by the first defendant's management, which included the second defendant, to make the plaintiff redundant, but before she could be informed of this, the plaintiff told Mr and Mrs Erbas that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Accordingly, Mr Erbas decided not to tell her about this decision and to delay implementing any decision about the plaintiff's redundancy (T 216-217).

69The plaintiff's evidence was that only a few people in the office knew she had cancer, namely Mr and Mrs Erbas, Mr Parissis (T 13), Mr Martin (T 57) and Ms Montemayor (T 58). She denied that other staff knew. She particularly referred to Sam Shanehsaz (T 58), although this was contradicted by Mr Shanehsaz in his evidence (T 313). 

70After the plaintiff's operation she had to undergo chemotherapy. After her first session of chemotherapy she shaved her head and wore a bandana (T 59). She was absent one full week in three prior to the matter complained of being sent. As is set out in more detail below, I have no difficult accepting the evidence of the defendants' witnesses that everyone in the office knew that the plaintiff had had cancer and was having ongoing treatment. 

71The plaintiff's claim that others in the office did not know why she was sick was one of a series of issues upon which I found her evidence to be improbable, unreliable or both.

72The first of these relates to the circumstances in which the plaintiff first read the matter complained of. Since the plaintiff's claim is for hurt to feelings, the circumstances in which she first learned of, and read, the matter complained of are matters of some significance, and unreliable or inconsistent evidence as to the circumstances may lead to adverse findings on credit for the reasons explained by the Court of Appeal in Jones v Sutton (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 203 (for a practical application of these principles to the facts in a defamation claim, see Bushara v Nobananas [2013] NSWSC 225 at [29] - [61]).

The email of 5 July

73The second defendant described how he came to write the matter complained of as follows:

""A. I wanted to talk about this because the people who are obviously in the office on that day had to take more load, some of them had to stay back, it was a genuine cry from the employer ""Help, we have to make sure we finalise these jobs"" and we actually discussed this at the meeting so that we can change the deadlines for all those projects so that we can still give what the client asks. If we can't deliver those things clients will just not give us any more work and there wont be any employment for anybody."" (T 226)

74He was asked why he mentioned sick days, and replied:

""A. Sick days, if it is unknown to us sometimes we do know because people are saying ""I'm going to be sick for three days"" that is known days so we actually arrange those days for other people to complete the work. If it is happening during the day, which happens at any time, they call during the day and those are the ones that we have to handle that day and make sure that as soon as we hear we actually tell other staff to make sure they finish the work or call the client saying, ""We cannot deliver this work, can we issue it a day later."" So it takes a lot of responsibility to make sure that the projects are delivered. It takes a lot of responsibility of the others while working in the office to deliver the projects basically."" (T 226)

75The problem concerning holiday leave arose, he said, as follows:

""A. Normally they come and tell us weeks and weeks ago [sic]. I think according to our contract a month ago but sometimes they just come the next day or sometimes they ever call on the spot and we don't want to say no to people and they call saying, ""I want to take a holiday today because"" of something and I just say, ""Fine"" and we write it in the calendar that day or the day before."" (T 226)

76The second defendant said he was particularly concerned about unplanned absences such as late arrival at work (T 261-262):

""Q. But do you agree that whether they're sick or latecomers, they were reporting sick, that the sickness of those four people caused you to say this is not fair to the company and the ones who come on time?
A. That wasn't to do with the sick people. It was for the latecomers. For the sick people and latecomers, we had to rearrange the deadlines.

77It was the cumulative effect of these absences that caused problems:

""Q. What's the cry from the employer; so, you were making a cry. Is that right?
A. Well, it's a genuine statement from the owner, basically, telling the rest of the team that we have to do something about this today, because five out of six drafts people were sick and off that day, and it is too hard for any business to accommodate five out of six people who are doing exactly the same job.

Q. If it was a cry from the employer, it shows the employer was upset, does it not?
A. No, it was just a request for the rest to make sure they actually work a little bit harder to deal with the job."" (T 264)

78The second defendant's evidence was that when he wrote the email, he was not upset, but that management was hurt, and that he was hurt, by so many absences:

""Q. But you were upset?
A. Again, I'm answering the same question again: no, I wasn't upset.

Q. Why did you say you'd be looking at this very seriously in the next days?
A. I'm a very serious person, and I have to make sure they are done. People are relying on me. I have people in the office. I have clients. And you have to again, I'm saying the same thing again and again because you're asking the same question again and again.

Q. ""Today, five people sick and one on holidays. It hurts management to run the projects.""
A. Yes, it hurts me. We have to make sure the jobs are done. I think Sylvia would understand it being one of the team players in the office, she knows it much better than anybody else in the office.

Q. But she was genuinely sick. Why did you send the email to her?
A. It was not sent to her. When I sent it to Erbas, it just goes to everyone. I don't actually write their names one by one. It's one email; it just says Erbas. Actually line you send it, as you can see, it says to Erbas & Associates; you click there, it goes to everyone. There is no name there.

Q. Look, I'm going to put t you you're not being frank with the Court, and that when you sent this email
A. This is a serious allegation, your Honour.

Q. Not particularly serious."" (T 256)

79Mr Erbas' evidence was that, after the 2008 global economic crisis, the first defendant's profits began to drop, and it was necessary to change the nature of its work and began providing mechanical engineering services only. The number of mechanical engineers and design draftspersons the first defendant employed began to decrease, from 12 mechanical engineers in 2008 (T 208) to six. These reductions in staff numbers came from redundancies and resignations (T 208, 214 - 5).

80Mr Erbas said (T 216) that a decision had been made in late 2009 to retrench the plaintiff, but it was not implemented because in February 2010 the plaintiff was diagnosed with breast cancer (T 216 - 7). Surgery and chemotherapy were scheduled. This required the plaintiff to take substantial absences from work, which were noted in the office electronic diary as ""off sick"". He said that he had been supportive of the plaintiff's ill-health from the time she first told him about it.

When did the plaintiff first read the email of 5 July?

81The plaintiff described how she came to hear of (but not read) the email on 5 July when a fellow employee whose name she could not recall telephoned her at home:

""Q. I want to take you to 5 July, that's a Monday.
A. Yes. Yes.

Q. Where were you?
A. I would have been at home because 6 July was my sixth chemo.

Q. Chemo day?
A. My last chemo, yeah.

Q. Were you willingly at home?
A. No, I would have preferred to work.

Q. You didn't work because?
A. Because I was asked not to work on the Monday before my chemo.

Q. By Steven?
A. That's correct.

Q. Did anyone tell you anything on that day?
A. Yeah, somebody contacted me.

Q. When?
A. On the Monday about an email.

Q. What did they say?
A. They just said that there was an email about the amount of sick leave and everything and my name was there the most and they thought that was unfair.

...

Q. Do we know the name of the person who rang up? Do you know the name of the person who rang up?
A. I can't remember the name of the person who rang up.

Q. Was it from work?
A. Yes. Because they rang me up to ask me about something at work, but I can't remember.

Q. Was it a male or a female?
A. It was a male. Definitely a male.

...

Q. But you didn't get the email, is that right?
A. No, I hadn't seen the email as yet.

Q. When did you see it?
A. I saw the email on the 15 July.

Q. Yes, because you didn't go into work that week?
A. That's correct.

Q. When was the next time you went to work?
A. On 15 July.

Q. Why didn't you go to work? Was that a Thursday?
A. Yes.

Q. Why didn't you go to work on the 12th, 13th and 14th?
A. I was sick."" (T 22-26)

82The plaintiff was shown her Gmail account, which showed she accessed the work email on the day that it was sent (Exhibit 2). 

""Q. You sent a copy of the email, that is the matter complained of, on 5 July to that email address, the Gmail address; isn't that correct?
A. I'm not sure.

Q. Well you say you're not sure. You've just told her Honour that you hadn't seen this email before 15 July, so which is it?
A. Well I my I recall that I saw it on 5 July how could I have sent it on 5 on 15 July, how could I have sent it on 5 July?

Q. And it says to slyenders@gmail, your Gmail address, correct?
A. Yes.

Q. And it's forwarding, you'll agree with me, the matter complained of, isn't that right?
A. The email?

Q. Yes, in what follows pages 2 and 3, you see that?
A. Yep.

...

Q. And you sent that, didn't you, Ms Enders, at or about the date which it bears; isn't that correct?
A. Well I don't know if I sent that. I don't recall sending it.

Q. Well isn't it the case that you did you saw that email on 5 July, didn't you?
A. I don't recall.

Q. And you forwarded other emails from work to your Gmail address, haven't you?
A. I have. When I left the company I did, yes."" (T 61 - 2)

83The date the plaintiff read the matter complained of is important, because the plaintiff's evidence was that as soon as she read the email, which she said was on 15 July, she when to see the second defendant and said she was upset by the email:

""Q. Did you speak to Ken about it?
A. I did.

Q. What did you say to him?
A. I went to Ken and I said:

""Ken, you know my name shouldn't really be on this list because number one you know I'm sick, you know I'm having chemotherapy and you know, you know the reasons so I shouldn't be labelled as somebody being sick and being a slacker, you know, because I'm not a slacker. And as well as that, you know, there's days there that you've asked me not to come in as in the company and then I'm being told my name's written there as being sick, and I feel I'm being labelled for it and crucified for it""

And he said he couldn't exclude me from it."" (T 38)

84The second defendant's evidence at T 265 challenged this evidence as follows:

""Q. Yes, Sylvia told you that she was upset by it?
A. She never told me that, not once ever and I would have done something about it, definitely.

Q. She spoke to you and asked you, in effect, why you wrote the email and included her in it?
A. She has never spoken to me not once, she has not spoken to me anything with this email at all.

Q. I put it to you that she did and I suggest you have forgotten about it?
A. I would not forget anything like this, this is very important. If my staff comes and talks to me I certainly do something about it.""

85The plaintiff had accessed her work emails and copied them into her Gmail account on other occasions. This included other documents relevant to her health problems:

""Didn't you send other emails in September about your work?
A. I'm not sure. I don't remember.

Q. I'll show you a document?
A. Mmhmm.

Q. Do you recognise that as an email at the top that appears to have been sent from your Gmail address to another address of yours at OptusNet, do you see that? In September?
A. Yeah.

Q. It's forwarding an email from June, do you see that, 2010, 2 June 2010?
A. It's very hard to read this copy.

Q. Take your time. Do you agree that it is forwarding, in fact if you look over the page there's another email
A. Well, yeah, it's from my Gmail account to my Optus account, yeah, so
what's the point?

Q. The question is, Ms Enders, that it is forwarding, below that there's a forwarded message
A. Yeah.

Q. do you see that line there, it says forwarded message?
A. That's from Ilkay Erbas to me, to my Gmail account.

Q. Isn't it to
A. And it's CC'd to Steven Parissis, his email account at Erbas.

Q. I see, and so it Ilkay is saying to you, this is on 2 June, do you see that?
A. Yes.

Q. ""I hope you feel better now""?
A. Yes.

Q. ""Everyone is sick these days""?
A. Yes.

Q. ""Just stay at home and take care of yourself"", do you see that?
A. Yes.

Q. ""No good coming on Friday just for one day as it is the weekend""?
A. Yes.

Q. ""Another two, three days of the weekend will make you feel better"", do you see that?
A. Yes.

Q. She ends saying, ""Wish you well. See you soon"", do you see that?
A. ""As I am flying tomorrow for two and a half weeks. Will be back on the 21st, so I will pay you when I come back"", yes.

Q. ""Wish you well""
A. ""Wish you well. See you soon"", yes."" (T 63 - 4)

86The plaintiff not only denied she was able to send emails to her home, but said she could not recall that she sent this email to herself. She denied she also sent the attached diary extract, although the email clearly shows an attachment of identical size (5,413 kilobytes) (T 72). 

87Whether or not the plaintiff remembers doing so, the objective evidence of this document, the provenance for which is undisputed (in that it was discovered by the plaintiff), is that the plaintiff saw the matter complained of on the same day that it was published and forwarded a copy to her private email address, including the attached diary extract. 

The 16 July meeting

88It was put to the plaintiff that she never complained to the second defendant on 15 July and that she never took up the opportunity to complain or raise the matter complained of at the 16 July meeting despite the matter complained of saying this would be discussed, and her own evidence that it was in fact discussed (T 74). She agreed (T 75) she had said nothing at the meeting, but insisted that she had spoken to Mr Erbas about the matter complained of. The plaintiff's personal diary contains no references to any such meeting (T 175).

89I do not accept the plaintiff's evidence that she did not see the email on 5 July. She clearly did, and sent a copy to her private email address. This means she did nothing about the email for 10 days, even though she claimed to be distressed by it. In addition, she failed to say anything about this email at the staff meeting. In those circumstances, I do not accept her evidence that she spoke to Mr Erbas about it. Mr Erbas' evidence, that if she had spoken to him about it he would have done something, is the evidence that I accept.

Office procedure for late arrivals and sick leave

90The plaintiff also denied any knowledge of concern by Mr Erbas at staff running late (T 84). However, when asked why she had telephoned the receptionist on 23 June to advise she would be 15 minutes late because of a traffic accident, she agreed there was a procedure in place for this information to be recorded (T 85).

91The plaintiff's evidence that she was fit to come into work (T 100) from 31 May to June 4 and did not attend work because she was told to stay away. However, when shown her sick leave form, she eventually conceded (T 152 - 3) that she had told her employers in an email on the following Tuesday that she had a very bad sore throat. 

92The plaintiff's absence for this week was documented by a signed sick leave form. When shown her sick leave form for the period 31 May to June 4, the plaintiff at first attempted to deny that her signature appeared on it (T 153). Tender of the document was objected to, on the basis that she denied that it was her signature (T 154, line 40) and that the document had been provided only the day before the trial (T 155 line 12). In fact the document had been provided as one of 38 leave applications of the plaintiff, all signed, in item 5 of the defendants' List of Documents of 5 April. Mr Evatt vigorously objected to the tender, saying it was a ""forgery"" and he was ""going to go to ICAC"" (T 157). Mr McHugh SC then handed the whole bundle of sick leave applications to the plaintiff and asked her to mark the signatures which were not hers with a yellow sticker. The plaintiff marked three of these as containing signatures which were not hers, but further objection was then abandoned (T 161), and the documents tendered.

93If there had been claims of forgery in relation to discovered documents, this would be a serious matter. These documents were discovered by the defendant, and there is a procedure in r 17.5 UCPR which should be followed in such circumstances. It is not an allegation to be made lightly.

94These allegations of forgery do not reflect well upon the plaintiff's credit. Contrary to the plaintiff's claims that she was being marked down as being sick when she was not, she filled in sick leave forms, which I find accurately reflect what occurred. 

95Another example of the plaintiff's tendency to exaggerate was her claim that her radiation appointments were after work, and that she could have worked full time while undergoing radiation treatments. Her evidence was that she was told by her employer to work half days during the time she was undergoing radiation when this was unnecessary. However, radiation appointment records were shown to be at times such as 3.25 and 2.40 pm. The plaintiff had to drive from the St Leonards office to the Prince of Wales hospital for this procedure. The arrangements she had with the first defendant to have this time off was contrary to her evidence that she was available to work.

96The plaintiff's evidence on these issues was evasive or inconsistent with contemporaneous documentation and I do not accept her as a witness of credit.

An evidentiary problem: the electronic office diary

97The plaintiff challenged the accuracy of the office diary, and in particular the description of her absences on certain occasion being described as being ""off sick"" when she was remaining home, she said, on the directions of her employer as there was no work for her.

98The defendants sought to tender the whole of the electronic office diary for an extensive period prior to the extract in the matter complained of in question. This tender was objected to by the plaintiff, on the basis of failure to discover the diary in accordance with orders made after two contested applications by the plaintiff for further and better discovery. The electronic diary suffered from the additional problem of being difficult to read in paper form, which meant it was necessary for the defendants to bring the necessary computer equipment to court to enable it to be read.

99I rejected the tender of the electronic office diary (other than the portion which was attached to the matter complained of) partly because of the failure to comply with earlier discovery orders and partly because of the difficulties in reading the document. The defendants have requested full reasons for my ruling in this judgment, and I now provide those reasons.

100Failure to discover a document does not make that document inadmissible at the trial, and the circumstances in which tender of a document will be rejected on such a basis must be compelling. This is particularly the case in defamation proceedings, where appellate courts have shown indulgence towards the tender of undiscovered material, expert reports and unparticularised evidence. Andrews v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 225 at 235 - 6 demonstrate this approach. In Andrews, when the defendant complained it was ""unfairly prejudiced' by the tender of undiscovered material, Hutley JA stated that such prejudice could be remedied by an adjournment or, ""in extreme cases"", by aborting the trial. The burden of proving that the trial should be aborted lay on the party complaining of the failure to discover (Bickel v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd [1981] 2 NSWLR 474 at 484 - 5, citing Andrews). These decisions are all the more persuasive as the difficulties of adjourning defamation jury trials are significant.

101The same consideration has been shown in non-jury trials. In Hewitt v West Australian Newspapers (1976) 17 ACTR 15, where there was the journalist under cross-examination admitted an undiscovered document was in his desk, the hearing was adjourned to enable him to find it. (The journalist was later fined $500 for refusal to answer questions, but the only consequence of his conduct was that he was not accepted as a witness of credit). In Quinlan v Rothwell [2002] 1 Qd R 647, where the matters complained of were published in 1988 and 1990, the plaintiff took until 2000 to comply with a 1994 order to amend the statement of claim and was similarly dilatory in compliance with orders for particulars and discovery. Douglas J struck the proceedings out for want of prosecution and failure to provide full discovery. The Court of Appeal set this order aside on appeal, although warning that ""the former laissez faire attitudes of the courts... has ended"" (at [29]).

102In Preston v Harbour Pacific Management Underwriting [2008] NSWCA 216 the appellant sought a new trial after the defendant in defamation proceedings had failed to discover a document Handley JA described as ""of vital importance in the appellant's defamation action"" (at [38]). The appellant sought a new trial. Handley JA noted that the appellant's former solicitor also had a copy of this document in his file, although the evidence was unclear as to how he had come by it. The appellant's default was similar, if not greater, and the application for a new trial was refused.

103English authorities have shown a particular degree of flexibility in relation to discovery where the documents in question are electronic, such as mobile phone records: Various Claimants v News Group Newspapers Ltd [2012] All ER (D) 37 (Mar). Mr Mulcaire was a private investigator employed by News Group from 1998 until 2006, when he was convicted of 609 mobile telephone voicemail interception offences. Proceedings were commenced by a large group of persons for damages and discovery of all documents for the period of Mr Mulcaire's employment was sought, on the basis that the documentation discovered (which was from 2001 onwards) was sparse. News Group successfully argued that ""enough is enough"" (at [91]) and that it should not be put to the trouble and expense of searching for mobile phone records and emails prior to 2001, especially since admissions were made by News covering the period 2001 - 6 and the essential question for damages was the hurt suffered by the claimants.

104What these cases show is that the court must consider complaints about late discovery or failure to discover in the context of the facts in dispute, and should look to the determination of the issues in question rather than seeking to punish a litigant for non-compliance with orders or professional obligations.

105In the present case, before these proceedings were sent to me for hearing, there was a contested application in the Defamation List for further and better discovery, resulting in the parties preparing a list of categories of documents. No judgment is available, but the issues discussed can be ascertained from the orders. Prior to the trial I heard a second application for further and better discovery and made orders accordingly: [2012] NSWDC 129. The defendants not only failed to include the electronic diary in response to those orders, but also served this lengthy document late, and in hard copy form only, despite it being difficult to read.

106This brings me to the next basis of objection, which is that the hard copy is difficult to read as portions of the diary are cut off. In order to look at the document in court, I asked for it to be sent to me electronically. However, the size of the document was such that the court server rejected it (T109). Attempts to view it in court were unsuccessful. Mr McHugh SC then told me that I would need the software on his clients' computer to read the document, and this was brought in the following day. He conceded that discovery of the electronic version should have been given (T 107). Unfortunately, when the computer was brought to court the following day there were further technical difficulties. The plaintiff submitted that in these circumstances the document should be rejected under s 135 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) in that it was likely to cause confusion and delay, and the document was irrelevant to the issues before the court.

107This is a clear case where leave to tender an undiscovered document should not be granted. The failure to discover the electronic document after two contested applications, the lateness with which it was produced, and its unreliability in its present form, are matters for which the defendants have no explanation. Accordingly I rejected the tender of the whole electronic diary by the defendants.

108This brings me to the question of what happened at the staff meeting referred to in the matter complained of.

What happened at the staff meeting following publication of the matter complained of?

109As foreshadowed in the matter complained of, a staff meeting was held on 16 July 2010. The relevant entries are:

""...

2. We have a great team working effectively; Hydraulic is short of people so we employed Sergei a very senior hydraulic engineer as Contractor. We target 7 people for the hydraulic team. While John is away, Stephen Brown spends lots of extra hours to cope up with job deadlines.

...

6. Punctuality - everyone should be in the office at 9am. I have noticed that 2 or 3 people are coming late in the office everyday. We all should be mindful in taking holidays, sick leaves and most of all tardiness as this affects our productivity.

...""

110The plaintiff was cross-examined about whether she raised the issue of the email at the staff meeting:

""Q. Now you said earlier in your evidence that you complained to Mr Erbas about the email on 15 July or thereabouts, is that right?
A. Yes.

Q. 15 July?
A. Yes.

Q. Now I suggest that never happened, did it? You never complained to him, did you?
A. I did.

Q. There was a meeting the next day, wasn't there?
A. Yes.

Q. And the matter complained of speaks about, ""Let's talk about this at a staff meeting"", doesn't it? Do you need to look at exhibit A? I've probably paraphrased that incorrectly. Do you have exhibit A there?
A. No.

...

Q. Now do you see just before the sign off, ""Regards Ken Gurcan Erbas""?
A. Yes.

Q. Do you see it says, ""We'll talk about this at our first staff meeting""?
A. Yes.

Q. That's the meeting that you had on 16 July, isn't that right?
A. That's correct.

Q. And are you sure about that date, 16 July?
A. Well, pretty sure. It's what I had written.

Q. It's what you had written?
A. Initially, yes, inhouse meeting.

Q. And when did you have it written?
A. On the day it happened.

Q. On the day it happened?
A. Yes.

Q. You didn't make any complaint at that meeting did you about the email?
A. No.

Q. You never complained to Mr Erbas about this email, did you?
A. Yes, I did.

Q. And you never complained to anyone else about it at the time, did you?
A. Yes, I did."" (T 74-75)

111The minutes of the meeting show Mr Erbas was concerned about latecomers. Mr Erbas referred in the matter complained of to 21 diary entries for persons running late. (In fact, he may have miscounted, but no submissions were made about this, nor was there any reference to his having also circled entries for employees leaving early.) Only one entry relates to the plaintiff and she pleads no imputation in relation to it. This preoccupation of the second defendant with people running late was referred to by several witnesses, such as Mr Parissis at T 308:

""Q. Now I'll put it again. Mr Erbas was very concerned about people who were running late and being off sick?
A. No.

Q. He wasn't?
A. Mr Erbas is not concerned of people who take sick days off or are sick because it's the nature of humans. I've never seen him being concerned about that. He's concerned about people running late.""

112This is indicative of Mr Erbas' state of mind; he did not misuse the occasion, but genuinely believed (Horrocks v Lowe [1975] AC 135; [1974] 1 All ER 662; [1974] 2 WLR 282) that there was a serious latecomer problem. Other employees of the first defendant gave evidence consistent with this. Maria Montemayor, the receptionist who kept the office diary, gave evidence that punctuality was discussed regularly at office meetings at which the plaintiff was present. Mr Erbas was concerned about absenteeism generally (T 294).

113Ms Montemayor stated that the plaintiff said nothing at the meeting following the email being sent to staff (T 289). She did not see the plaintiff crying or distressed on the day of this meeting (T 289 - 90, 294), although her office was a short distance away from that of the plaintiff (T 297). To her observation Mr Erbas spoke to the plaintiff, and to all staff, ""nicely"" (T 289) and not angrily. 

114Mr Parissis, a non-financial director of the first defendant and a mechanical engineer, said that the plaintiff worked ""in my team"" (T 302). He said there was a ""massive change"" to the building industry and their mechanical workload dropped. This meant that staff who left were not replaced, and that redundancies were necessary (T 305-306). The plaintiff's redundancy was deferred because she had cancer (T 306). As soon as she was diagnosed he made an agreement with her that she would come in when she could and that ""if she couldn't"" (T 306) because of health problems, she would not come in. He denied telling her not to come in to work during the period in question (T 310-311). He did not see her crying on the day of the meeting.

115Sam Shanehsaz, a mechanical engineer, gave evidence that the plaintiff told him she had cancer (T 313). He particularly recalled that when she commenced chemotherapy she shaved her head and wore a bandanna. He thought the plaintiff was not at the meeting. She was unhappy about the email (T 316), he stated, but did not say when she told him this.

116All of the evidence paints a picture of a closely-knit office of about 20 employees, working in teams on engineering projects to deadlines, in a company severely hit by the global financial crisis, and changing its work practices in order to cope. Absences from the office were monitored by the use of the office diary, sick leave forms and regular staff meetings. They affected productivity.

117Having set out the factual background, I now consider the defences pleaded.

The qualified privilege defences

118The defendants have pleaded defences of qualified privilege at common law and pursuant to s 30. This has included a reliance upon Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd [2001] 2 AC 127, and I shall deal with this submission first. In Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden [2002] NSWCA 419 at [1165]ff the New South Wales Court of Appeal dismissed a similar argument in relation to common law qualified privilege. The defendants now put the submission before me on the basis that Reynolds may be applied to the s 30 defence as well. As was the case with the plaintiff's ""republication"" plea, this new argument has added unnecessary complexity to the issues of fact and law in this case.

Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd [2001] 2 AC 127

119After objection by Mr Evatt to some issues in the defendants' written submissions, revised written submissions (replacing the original submissions) raised an additional, unpleaded claim (pages 26 - 28, paragraphs 6.5 - 6.9), namely a reliance upon Reynolds v Times Newspapers [2001] 2 AC 127, and the subsequent rejection of the ""restrictive"" (i.e. pro-plaintiff) approach previously taken, as outlined and criticised in Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe SPRL [2006] UKHL 44. The defendants note that in Jameel the defence was upheld ""despite non-compliance with a number of factors"" in the Reynolds checklist, which the defendants submit resembles the s 30 checklist (written submissions, [6.8]). The defendants' submissions go on to state that the Reynolds defence is not confined to the news media ""and would therefore also be available to the defendants."" 

120This is as close as the defendants get to expressly stating whether the Reynolds defence operates as an extension of the common law defence, or to the s 30 defence, or as a defence somewhere in between (Marshall v Megna [2013] NSWCA 30). In the course of oral submissions, the defendants appeared to apply these principles to both the statutory and common law defences. The written submissions, however, appear to restrict this submission to the s 30 defence, where the defendants submit that ""there is absolutely no warrant whatsoever for applying to s 30 the highly restrictive interpretations given to and various glosses placed on s 22 of the Defamation Act 1974"" (written submissions, [6.9]), namely Morgan v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1991) 23 NSWLR 374 at 388 and, more recently, Daily Examiner Pty Ltd v Mundine; Brown v Mundine [2012] NSWCA 195. The defendants go on to assert that the High Court ""never gave a decision on the proper interpretation of s 22"", but that when it does, decisions prior to Reynolds and to s 22(2A) of the 1974 Act will no longer represent the law, and that s 30(3) cases will ""reflect a form of interpretation very similar to the approach of Eady J deprecated in Jameel and are of little assistance in arriving at the proper interpretation of s 30"" (written submissions [6.9]). It is further asserted, in relation to this defence, that the plaintiff bears the onus of proof as to malice, and has failed to do so (written submissions [6.11]).

121The written submissions in reply of the plaintiff point out (at [32]) that the Court of Appeal in John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Vilo (2001) 52 NSWLR 373 held that Reynolds is not part of Australian law insofar as it extends the common law beyond Lange. The plaintiff's submissions also point out that s 30 sets out its own guidelines and principles which should not be impugned by the propositions in Reynolds.

122Although Mr Evatt characterised the defendants' submissions as ""novel"", this submission has been made before. In Obeid v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2006] NSWDC 26 (at [72]), in which I was the trial judge, a similar submission was made in relation to the regime under the repealed legislation, although senior counsel for the defendants acknowledged that I was bound both by Vilo and by Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden [2002] NSWCA 419 at [1165] - [1170]. I rejected that argument there, and I do so again, noting in addition the NSW Court of Appeal's decision in Marshall v Megna [2013] NSWCA 30 as to the need for caution when extending the boundaries of the common law defence. The same caution should be shown in relation to s 30, in my view. 

123Any willingness of the Australian courts to embrace the principles in Reynolds seems even less likely now that proposals to amend defamation legislation in the United Kingdom will result in Reynolds being overruled. Sir Stephen Sedley has confirmed the abolition of the Reynolds defence in legislation currently before the House of Lords (""After Leveson: Stephen Sedley on Press Regulation"", London Review of Books, Vol. 35, No. 7, 11 April 2013). 

124Whether or not such a submission is novel, it has been neither pleaded nor particularised, and I note in this regard the concerns of Allsop P in Marshall at [34]:

""As Beazley JA puts it at [155] the argument about the politically founded category of qualified privilege was ""raised ... in an alarmingly non-specific way"". Her Honour has accepted that it was raised. For my part, that is a charitable view. This Court has said on a number of occasions that judges should be presented with issues with clarity: see by way of example, Nowlan v Marson Transport [2001] NSWCA 346; 53 NSWLR 116 at [28] - [29] approving White v Overland [2001] FCA 1333 at [4]. The Parliament has also said so, in effect, in the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), ss 56-60. Parties and counsel have a basal obligation to be clear about what issues are being raised for disposition. If issues are raised obliquely or hesitatingly and are not grasped by a trial judge, a party cannot complain in this Court. Efficient disposition of issues in litigation depends upon the clear identification of issues [emphasis added by Allsop P].""

125However, although not referring to Reynolds, the Court of Appeal's decision in LVMH Watch & Jewellery Australia Pty Ltd v Lassanah [2011] NSWCA 370 has taken a similar approach in relation to the s 30 checklist. In LVMH the Court upheld the defence principally on the basis of absence of malice, and was satisfied with compliance with a few, rather than all, of the items in the s 30 checklist. The defendants are on surer ground relying upon this decision than upon Reynolds; the significant impact of LVMH in relation to the s 30 defence is considered in more detail below. 

126Having noted my rejection of the proposition that the Reynolds decision has any bearing on the defence of qualified privilege at common law or pursuant to s 30, I now consider the issues of fact and law relevant to these defences.

Qualified privilege at common law

127In Bushara v Nobananas Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 225 at [81] (and in Cantwell v Sinclair [2011] NSWSC 1244), Rothman J sets out a short history of the interpretation of this defence at appellate level, noting some ""controversy"" in relation to its interpretation in the past. While this may have been the case, particularly in relation to the role of the dissenting decision of McHugh J in Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) (2004) 218 CLR 366, the principles relevant to qualified privilege at common law have now been explained in a series of decisions by the High Court, and more recently by New South Wales Court of Appeal in Marshall v Megna [2013] NSWCA 30, and I gratefully adopt Beazley JA's careful explanation in Marshall v Megna of the relevant principles which must be applied.

128It is important not to conflate the defences of qualified privilege at common law (discussed below) with the s 30 defence (discussed at [150]ff). The distinction between these defences must be borne in mind when applying the principles so helpfully explained in these decisions, each of which need to be considered and applied in light of the issues in each case. 

(a) Was the publication was made on a protected occasion?

129In general terms, a communication is protected at common law if it is fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty, whether legal or moral, or in the conduct of his/her own affairs, in matters where his/her interests are concerned: Toogood v Spyring (1834) 1 C M & R 181, 149 ER 1044. Professor Brown (Brown on Defamation: Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States, 2nd ed., (Carswell) at [13.2(1)], footnote 11) sets out some of the many hundreds of decisions which have endorsed these principles. Professor Brown adds that Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ, in Bashford v Information Australia (Newsletters) Pty Ltd at [10] have explained that this requires the trial court to make ""a close scrutiny of the circumstances of the case, of the situations of the parties, of the relations of all concerned and of the events leading up to and surrounding the publication."" 

130The existence of duties within a company or business, commercial and business relationships and between employers and employees is comprehensively reviewed by Professor Brown at [13.3(1)(e)]. These include duties to advise of accusations against a company employee (see also Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon (2011) 243 CLR 298 at [11] - [19]), discuss activities detrimental to the company, and canvass conduct relevant to business efficiency.

131I shall briefly note one submission by the defendants that I do not accept. The defendants submit (written submissions, [4.9] - [4.13]) that they were under a legal duty to make the publication under the Occupational Health & Safety Act 2000 (NSW) as the health, safety and welfare of workers was the subject matter of the email, and it would be a criminal offence not to comply. The obligation to identify ""fatigue related hazards"" contained in cl 9(1) of the Regulations would be applicable, as would other provisions designed to keep the workplace safe from risk of harm. The terms of the matter complained of, and the evidence of all the witnesses, make it clear that the circumstances of the publication related to business efficiency and fair distribution of work, not injury to health or work hazards. I agree with the plaintiff's submissions that it is unnecessary for the defendants to rely upon occupational safety legislation to establish either an occasion of privilege or that the recipients have the necessary interest in receiving it.

132The facts of this case give a very clear example of a duty which was not only moral, but social and legal, in that the publication related to the satisfactory performance of the company's work by its employees.

133This brings me to the second element in relation to whether the matter complained of was published on a protected occasion. It is not enough that the occasion is privileged if the person to whom the information is communicated is not entitled to receive it: ""reciprocity is essential"" (Adam v Ward [1917] AC 309 at 334). The defendant must establish the necessary degree of relationship between the interest he/she seeks to pursue, and the person to whom the publication has been communicated. 

134The many cases in which courts have recognised that a person may have an appropriate interest in receiving information because of an employment relationship are helpfully summarised by Professor Brown at [13.3(2)(c)]. For example, employees may be advised by an employer of an accusation made against one or more other employees (see also Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon, supra), or about business practices and efficiency.

135The present case is unusual, in that the diary entries are either personally entered, or otherwise authorised, by the recipients of the matter complained of. There is a complete overlap between the persons who received the matter complained of, the employees in the firm and the persons responsible for the contents of the diary which is an attachment to the matter complained of. Having regard to the fact-finding process identified by the High Court in Bashford, supra, this is a particularly strong set of factual circumstances in which to find that the matter complained of was published on an occasion protected by common law qualified privilege. This applies whether all of the imputations pleaded are conveyed or whether, as I have found, only imputations (c)-(e) are conveyed.

136I also note, in relation to each of the ""republication"" claims, that if the plaintiff was compelled to raise these matters as claimed, it would be hard for her to challenge any finding that any such republication was made on a protected occasion. (This is one of the many problems caused by this highly technical claim).

Can the protection be lost?

137The law on this issue has helpfully been summarised by Beazley JA in Marshall v Megna [2013] NSWCA 30 at [192]-[194]:

""[192] For there to be an occasion of qualified privilege which protects a person from liability for defamatory publications, there must be a sufficient connection to the privileged occasion to attract the defence. As the plurality explained in Bashford, at [22], an occasion of qualified privilege does not give a licence to defame. Rather:

It denies the inference of malice that ordinarily follows from showing that false and injurious words have been published

[193] A wrong or inaccurate statement of fact does not, of itself, sever the necessary connection with the privileged occasion or prevent the privileged occasion from arising. In Bashford, the matter complained of incorrectly stated that the plaintiff had been found guilty of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), s 52 whereas the party that had engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct had been a company controlled by the plaintiff and his wife. Notwithstanding that the published matter was inaccurate, it was held to be sufficiently connected, or in the language used in that case, at [29], ""did not alter or reduce the connection between the privileged occasion and the defamatory matter"".

[194] French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ made a similar observation in Cush v Dillon, at [19], when they observed that:

... [there] may be limits to what may be said upon a subject on an occasion of qualified privilege and that those limits are to be tested by the connection of the statement to the subject.""

138Beazley JA went on to add (at [201]):

""[201] Likewise, the use of excessive or extravagant language does not prevent there being a sufficient connection to the privileged occasion. In Cush v Dillon French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ accepted, at [24], the distinction drawn by Lord Esher MR in Nevill v Fine Arts and General Insurance Co [1895] 2 QB 156 at 170 between an excessive statement, which nonetheless was relevant to the privileged occasion, and the circumstances in which an excessive statement, made within the privileged occasion, may nonetheless be evidence of malice. Earl Loreburn had also noted this distinction in Adam v Ward when his Lordship observed, at 321, that exaggerated words used on an occasion of privilege may be evidence of malice but ""the two things are different"". The question of malice is considered below. The present point is that the language used, of itself even if excessive, is not the determinant of whether there is a sufficient connection between the defamatory material and the privileged occasion.""

139Mr Evatt did not identify the language asserted to be excessive to the occasion. The plaintiff is not singled out or identified in the email. Words such as ""hurt"" are not excessive or extreme, especially where the hurt is identified as being the impact on the company and on staff. If an imputation of malingering is conveyed (imputations (a) and (b)), this allegation involves neither excessive nor extreme language.

140I am satisfied that the language is proportionate to the occasion, namely an informal email from an employer to employees about a work-related problem which the employer wants to discuss at the next staff meeting.

141Nor would wrong or inaccurate statements necessarily cause the occasion to be lost, for the reasons Beazley JA has so helpfully explained in Marshall v Megna, supra. Errors of the kind identified by the plaintiff, such as the fact that Mr Erbas was at the office on 5 July and not out of the office as noted in the diary, are at best trivial. I am satisfied that the main ""error"" referred to, namely the characterisation of the plaintiff's absences from work as due to sick leave when she was wanting to work, is not an ""error"" at all, as I have accepted the evidence of Mr Erbas and Mr Parissis, and relied upon evidence that the plaintiff filled out sick leave forms for these absences.

142I am satisfied that the occasion of qualified privilege has not been lost.

(b) If made on a protected occasion, whether malice has been established

143A preliminary issue is the question of whether the malice of joint tortfeasors must be found in respect to each tortfeasor: Brown on Defamation: Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States, 2nd ed., (Carswell) at [16.5], p 16-180 (referring to Riddick v Thames Board Mills [1977] QB 881 (CA) per Waller LJ) and Tobin & Sexton, Australian Defamation Law & Practice at [18-040]. The conduct of a third party has been held to be relevant to absence of malice by a defendant (LVMH at [66]). However, the parties have agreed not to take any point as to whether the malice of Mr Erbas and/or Mr Parissis (an employee) can be attributed to the company; the malice of one defendant (including its employees) is agreed to be the malice of the other.

144The Court of Appeal in Marshall v Megna [2013] NSWCA 30 at [280]-[302] has explained the principles for determining malice as follows:

""[280] The defence of qualified privilege will be defeated where it is established that the defendant was actuated by an improper motive: Roberts v Bass at [76]. As the plurality observed in Cush v Dillon at [27], malice will be established where the person who made the defamatory statement did so for ""some purpose ... foreign to the privilege"".

[281] Malice must be proved by evidence. Almost invariably, such proof will be based upon the inferences to be drawn from the defendant's conduct or from the actual content of the defamatory material. In order for malice to be proved, the fact finding tribunal must determine whether the defendant acted, in making the defamatory statement, ""from a desire to discharge [the] duty"" which founds the occasion of privilege: Clark v Molyneux (1877) 3 QBD 237 at 250.

...


[289] Their Honours further stated, at [76], that in the special case where the defendant knew of the falsity of the defamatory statement, then proof of this knowledge would ordinarily be conclusive evidence that the publication was actuated by an improper motive and the qualified privilege would be defeated: Mowlds v Fergusson (1939) 40 SR (NSW) 311 at 327 per Jordan CJ; Horrocks v Lowe at 149-150 per Lord Diplock. This was distinguished from the case where there was ""mere proof of the defendant's ill-will, prejudice, bias, recklessness, lack of belief in truth or improper motive"", which the plurality held was insufficient, in itself, to establish malice.

[290] It should be noted, however, that in Cush v Dillon, Gummow, Hayne and Bell JJ, at [29], qualified this statement by observing that such knowledge may be ""almost conclusive evidence of malice"". As their Honours explained:

This is because a person who knowingly publishes false and defamatory material will usually have an improper motive. A lack of belief in the statement may stand in a different category. But in neither event is there warrant for equating knowledge or lack of belief with actual malice. (citation omitted)

[291] Their Honours recognised that knowledge of falsity may be insufficient if the defendant was under a legal obligation to make the defamatory communication. The plurality also pointed out, at [76], that mere proof of the other factors to which they had referred was not sufficient to establish malice. Rather, some ground had to be shown for concluding that one or more of such matters both ""existed on the privileged occasion and actuated the publication"" (original emphasis). However, malice may be proved even if factors such as those referred to above do not exist, provided that it is established that the publication was actuated by a motive foreign to the privileged occasion. As their Honours pointed out, at [76]:

... [this] is because qualified privilege is, and can only be, destroyed by the existence of an improper motive that actuates the publication.

[292] These tenets were approved by Gummow, Hayne and Bell JJ in Cush v Dillon in the following terms:

27 ... The question is whether some purpose foreign to the privilege caused Mrs Dillon to use the words she did.

28 In Roberts v Bass it was pointed out that qualified privilege, which attaches to a defamatory statement, can only be destroyed by the existence of an improper motive that causes the person to make the statement. Thus, lack of belief in the truth of the statement, or even ill-will felt towards the person defamed, will not be sufficient. There must be evidence that the making of the statement was actuated by improper motive. As Cotton LJ said in Clark v Molyneux the question is ""whether [the defendant] acted as he did from a desire to discharge his duty."" (citations omitted)

[293] Their Honours observed, at [77], that:

If the defendant knew the statement was untrue when he or she made it, it is almost invariably conclusive evidence of malice. That is because a defendant who knowingly publishes false and defamatory material almost certainly has some improper motive for doing so, despite the inability of the plaintiff to identify the motive. (citation omitted)

[294] At [78], their Honours dispelled the notion that the defendant's knowledge of the falsity of the defamatory material or lack of honest belief in making the publication constituted a separate head of malice. Rather their Honours asserted:

Knowledge of falsity is ""almost conclusive evidence"" that the defendant had some improper motive in publishing the material and that it actuated the publication. That judges have treated knowledge of falsity as almost conclusive evidence of malice is no ground, however, for treating it as a separate head of, or equivalent to, malice. (emphasis added)

[295] Their Honours, at [79], restated the fundamental proposition underlying malice:

It is the motive or purpose for which the occasion is used that is ultimately decisive, not the defendant's belief in the truth of the matter.

[296] In respect of the defendant's lack of belief in the truth of the defamatory material, the plurality stated, at [82]:

The privilege is not curtailed if lack of belief in a particular matter is merely some evidence from which it may be inferred in some circumstances that the defendant was actuated by an improper motive.

[297] Their Honours continued, at [83]:

In our opinion, neither lack of honest belief nor knowledge of falsity ipso facto destroys a defence of qualified privilege. But knowledge of falsity is ""almost conclusive evidence"" of improper motive, except where the defendant is under a legal duty to publish the defamation.

[298] Their Honours noted, at [84], that recklessness, in combination with other factors, may constitute ""cogent evidence"" that a privileged occasion was used for an improper motive.

[299] Their Honours also noted, at [87], that mere lack of belief in the truth of a communication was not the equivalent of knowledge of the falsity of the communication, and therefore could not be treated as conclusive proof of malice.

[300] At [87], their Honours further considered the circumstance where recklessness could be treated as evidence of malice. Their Honours stated that recklessness had to be accompanied by ""some other state of mind"", for instance, ""anger, hatred, bias or unreasoning prejudice"".

[301] Their Honours, at [90]-[95], considered the authorities that establish that only knowledge or belief in the falsity of the defamatory statement will ordinarily be treated as conclusive evidence of an improper motive.""

145The principles relating to the establishment of malice, being the publication of defamatory material with a dominant improper motive, were the subject of extensive consideration in Roberts v Bass (2002) 212 CLR 1 at [75]-[104] (Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ). The Amended Reply filed in court on 14 September 2012 has identified (in paragraph 2(ii)) nine grounds upon which malice is alleged.

The particulars of malice in the Amended Reply

146These are as follows:

(a)Recklessness in publishing the matter complained of - In Roberts v Bass at [84]-[86] Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ stated that in ""exceptional cases"" the ""sheer recklessness"" of a defendant in making the defamatory statements ""may justify"" a finding of malice. A finding of recklessness, in combination with other factors, may similarly be evidence of an improper motive. However, recklessness as to truth or falsity, in the absence of wilful blindness, will not necessarily destroy an occasion of qualified privilege by itself.The basis upon which the publication is asserted to be reckless is unclear, but it appears to be a failure to enquire. As the purpose of the office diary was to be as accurate as reasonably possible, Mr Erbas was entitled to treat it as such when he was composing the matter complained of. There is no evidence of recklessness on the part of the defendants, whether only some or all of the imputations pleaded are conveyed.

(b)Ill will, bias and/or prejudice against the plaintiff - It was asserted on behalf of the plaintiff that the defendants were motivated by malice in that they wished to dismiss her unfairly and sought to use her legitimate absences from work as an excuse or pretext.I have accepted the evidence of Mr Erbas and the other employees in the office. I have not found the plaintiff to be a witness of credit, and her claims of being the victim of ill will, bias and/or prejudice are without foundation. 

(c)The defendants' failure to admit publishing the matter complained of - This appears to be the result of there being some form of argument in the Defamation List about whether an inter-office email amounted to publication, and/or whether the plaintiff was identified. No judgment is available and I am uncertain about the nature and extent of the argument in question. A party is entitled to raise legitimate legal issues without these being evidence of malice. This ground is not made out.

(d)The defendants' conduct in terminating the plaintiff's employment by way of redundancy when she had recovered from her illness sufficiently so as to be able to work - This occurred well after the matter complained of and for unrelated reasons. I am satisfied from the evidence of Mr Erbas that there is no connection between the matter complained of and the circumstances in which, some months later, the plaintiff was made redundant.

(e)The defendants' conduct in breaching the plaintiff's right to privacy and confidentiality by publishing the matter complained of to other employees - This particular was not pressed in submissions or at the trial. The matter complained of consisted of the office diary extract and Mr Erbas' comment about the absences listed in it. There was no information which was private or confidential which was revealed.

(f)The defendants' conduct in defending the matter complained of by alleging that the profitability of the defendants' business justified publication of the matter complained of about the plaintiff - This is another example of the manner of presentation of a case being relied upon as a particular of malice. While the conduct of litigation by a defendant, including the conduct at the trial, may in certain circumstances amount to evidence of malice (see Tobin & Sexton at [18,040]), this is not one of them. Mr Erbas gave evidence about the significant impact on the company after the global financial crisis which resulted in a substantial profitability drop. The absence of 6 out of 20 employees on one day due to ill health and holidays was a matter of concern to him. This particular is not made out.

(g)Excessive and unnecessary widespread publication of the matter complained of - I am satisfied that the matter complained of was published to the employees of the first defendant. The difficulties in reading the office calendar on computer equipment other than that owned by the first defendant was such that the entry in question which identified the plaintiff would have been difficult for any person not using the first defendant's computer system to read.This particular is not made out. The fact that the plaintiff herself showed the matter complained of to friends and medical advisors is not a matter which can be relied upon as being excessive and unnecessary widespread publication by reason of the nature of compelled publications of this kind.

(h)Unfair and inaccurate wording of the references to the plaintiff in the matter complained of for 21 and 22 June wherein it was stated that the plaintiff ""called sick"" thereby implying she may not have been sick but only called or pretended to be sick - This was not the subject of evidence at the trial. In any event, I am satisfied that the expression ""called sick"" does not contain the sinister meaning asserted on behalf of the plaintiff.

(i)The plaintiff described as ""running late"" on 23 June thereby inferring that she was not sick on 21 or 22 June but was able to work and that the other statements that she was sick and unable to work were false - This particular of malice was not the subject of any evidence or submissions.

147In the course of the hearing and in submissions, Mr Evatt relied upon the knowledge of falsity of the defamatory material (Roberts v Bass at [79]-[83]). In Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon, supra, and LVMH, supra, the defendants did not intend to convey, or believe in the truth, of the imputations, and publication was denied. In the present case, Mr Erbas denied imputing that the plaintiff was a malingerer, but stood by the statement in the matter complained of. Mr Erbas honestly believed in the truth of what he wrote and described the contents of his email as ""genuine"" (T 236, 264). He disputed that the imputations arose (T 264) but stood by what he said. In addition, Mr Erbas denied that he was angry, upset or annoyed with the plaintiff, or otherwise motivated by hostility or ill will.

148Mr Erbas honestly believed that the company was ""hurt"" and that employees like himself and his wife, who came to work ""on time every time"" were ""hurt"" by other employees' clashing absences from work. He did not send the email for any collateral purpose, but for the purpose stated, namely to try to resolve the situation at the next staff meeting, which is exactly what he did.

149I am satisfied that the plaintiff has failed to establish malice.

Section 30 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW)

150Is it necessary, or appropriate, for the statutory defence to be pleaded for an inter-office memorandum to 20 staff members dealing with staff issues in which nearly all of them are named? Does the additional plea of ""republications"" by the plaintiff to her family and medical advisers require this defence to be pleaded? In order to determine these questions, it is necessary to examine how the NSW Court of Appeal has explained the relationship between the common law defence and the statutory defence (Senior Counsel for the defendants points out, in his written submissions, that the High Court has never considered s 30 or the repealed NSW legislation following the 2002 statutory amendments).

151It is uncontentious that courts have consistently rejected the existence of any general duty on the part of a mass media publisher to communicate to its audience information on matters of interest to them (see Tobin & Sexton at [14,070]). This led to a perception, now explained to be wrong by the Court of Appeal, that the statutory defence was an extension of the common law only for use by for mass publications such as media publications: Megna v Marshall at [168]).

152The relationship between the common law defence and s 22 (the predecessor to s 30) was explained by the NSW Court of Appeal in Bennette v Cohen [2009] NSWCA 60. In this case, as in LVMH and the present case, the number of persons present was small (in Bennette v Cohen, 80 to 100 ""interested residents"" who paid an admission fee to two fundraising meetings), but unlike these decisions, only the common law defence was pleaded. The defence of qualified privilege at common law succeeded at trial. The appellant argued (at [132]) that the necessary reciprocity did not exist and that the publication was not sufficiently connected to the occasion. Tobias J at [141] explained:

""[141] In Morosi (at 797) the court noted the limited application of the common law principles of qualified privilege compared to the enlarged protection or scope afforded by those principles by s 22 of the Act. That distinction was confirmed by the Privy Council in Austin v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1986] 1 AC 299 at 311-312. After referring to s 22, Lord Griffiths, delivering the advice of their Lordships, observed (at 311):

It is possible as a matter of construction to place a narrow or a broad construction on the words 'an interest' [in s 22(1)]. The narrow construction would equate 'an interest' with that type of interest which is usually looked for as an ingredient of the defence of qualified privilege at common law, that is to say, an interest material to the affairs of the recipient of the information such as would for instance assist in the working of an important decision or the determining of a particular course of action.

[142] The limits to the common law defence of qualified privilege expounded by this court in Morosi were enlarged in scope not only by s 22 of the Act but also, with respect to elections and similar public meetings, by the High Court in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25; (1997) 189 CLR 520 at 571. The relevance of Lange to the present discussion is its extension of the common law defence to the interest of the Australian public at large in receiving information concerning government and political matters. The duty to disseminate such information was, the court said, simply the correlative of the interest in receiving it.

[143] The point of present significance is that absent a Lange situation, the defence has only a limited application to information sought to be communicated to the public or a section of the public. ...

[144] In my view, the above passage from the joint judgment of all seven justices of the High Court makes it clear that in a case such as the present, where the respondent's statements were made to a large number of unidentified recipients at an unconstrained public meeting, it would need to be an exceptional case for the privilege to be attracted. Of the few exceptional cases referred to by the High Court (such as Adam v Ward), the present, in my opinion, is not one of them."" (Emphasis added)

153The defence has continued to be pleaded in relation to publications to a comparatively small number of people. A s 30 defence was successful in LVMH (at [135] - [142]), where imputations of stealing were made by police to the plaintiffs in front of some of the 300 passers-by who saw the plaintiffs being arrested, ordered to sit on the pavement and accused of attempting to rob the LVMH store. In Szanto v Melville [2011] VSC 574, the defence was pleaded in relation to a letter sent to four solicitors. In Cush v Dillon, Boland v Dillon [2009] NSWDC 21 at [77]-[78] the defence, pleaded to a publication to one person (a fellow Board member) failed; however, there was no suggestion, in the subsequent appeals to the Court of Appeal or High Court, that the pleading of this defence was unnecessary or inappropriate for a publication to one person.

Malice and s 30

154A finding of the presence of malice may play a part in defeating a s 30 defence (s 30(4)). The next issue is whether absence of malice is sufficient to defeat a s 30 defence, either by itself or in combination with one or more items in the checklist, as occurred in LVMH (at [137] - [142]). 

155The following statement is made at paragraph 6.11 of the defendants' written submissions:

""Again the onus is on the defendant [sic: should be ""plaintiff""] to establish malice. For the reasons stated above under common law she has failed to do so.""

156The first problem is that the plea of malice in the Reply (in identical form to the Reply in LVMH) confines the plea of malice to the common law defence only. The plaintiff must plead malice in relation to both defences, because different issues are raised: Belbin v Lower Murray Urban & Rural Water Corp (Ruling No 3) [2012] VSC 473. In Belbin, the plaintiff's failure to plead malice to both defences meant that he could not rely upon the jury's finding of malice to defeat the statutory defence. How, then, can a defendant rely upon the plaintiff's failure to plead malice in relation to the statutory defence if the Reply has not pleaded malice to both defences? However, as in LVMH, the parties never raised this issue, so I shall proceed as if the Reply has raised issues of malice in relation to both defences.

157Section 30(4) of the Act, which explains the relationship between malice and s 30, is couched in stern language:

""(4) For the avoidance of doubt, a defence of qualified privilege under subsection (1) is defeated if the plaintiff proves that the publication of the defamatory matter was actuated by malice.""

158""Avoidance of doubt"" (not a common legislative phrase) not only confirms the role of malice as well as the onus, but displaces the effect of the series of Court of Appeal decisions (most recently Griffith v Australian Broadcasting Corp [2010] NSWCA 9) which have held that s 22, the predecessor to s 30, provided a defence without further qualification, rather than a defence which could be defeated by malice. Hodgson JA explained in Griffith (at [115] - [123]) that if a publication is actuated by malice, then the conduct of the publisher would be unlikely to be reasonable. However, as Tobin & Sexton point out at [14,125], and as Hodgson JA states in Griffith at [122], the onus would then be on the defendant to prove absence of malice as part of reasonableness, rather than for the plaintiff to prove its presence. This is a difficult situation for the parties (and the trial judge) if both common law and statutory qualified privilege were pleaded, as the onus for proving malice for each of these defences is conflicting. 

159In Cush v Dillon; Boland v Dillon [2009] NSWDC 21, both the common law and statutory defences were pleaded. The trial judge held (erroneously) that the burden of establishing malice in relation to the common law defence lay on the defendant. That was a reversal of the burden of proof in relation to the common law defence, but would have been correct in relation to the s 22 defence (Griffith at [122]) if malice had been raised to defeat the defence. The trial judge in Cush v Dillon held (at [78]) the s 22 defence was not made out. The Court of Appeal set aside the common law qualified privilege finding ([2010] NSWCA 165) without referring to the role of malice in a s 22 defence, notwithstanding Griffith; the role of malice in the s 22 defence, and the question of who had to prove it, were not referred to in either decision.

160This history of the role of malice in relation to the statutory defence is necessary because the submissions of the defendants expressly state that not only that malice is relevant to the s 30 defence, but that absence of malice is, if not conclusive, highly relevant to the success of the s 30 defence. 

161The defendants are supported in this submission by LVMH v Lassanah, where the court considered not merely malice, but absence of malice to be conclusive in relation to s 30. Bergin A-JA based the s 30 finding on the fact ""that the Trial Judge's conclusion in relation to malice was not justified"" (at [137]). Her Honour goes on to note that ""other reasons"" (namely s 30 the checklist) were referred to by the trial judge (who was myself), but for the purpose of noting that the findings for the two items considered from the checklist were wrong. No reference is made to the other s 30 checklist items. Bergin A-JA then concludes that for ""the reasons earlier stated in relation to the Trial Judge's finding of malice"", and noting the errors of fact in these grounds, the s 30 defence is made out (at [142]). 

162Section 30(4) speaks only of the defence being defeated by a positive finding of malice, where the burden lies on a plaintiff; it is silent as to the effect of a finding that there is no malice. If a finding of no malice is made, is that sufficient to defeat a s 30 defence, despite this being a defence for which the onus of proof lies on the defendant? It would appear, from LVMH, that this is the case. If so, this is a significant development of the defence for media defendants, who could require a plaintiff to prove malice and, if the plaintiff failed, the media defendant would succeed in a s 30 defence without needing to go through the whole s 30 checklist. 

163As is set out above, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has not discharged the burden of proof to establish malice. This is a finding which is relevant to s 30(4), if the analysis of s 30(4) in LVMH is correct. Controversially, the defendants submit that absence of malice in these proceedings is evidence they rely upon for the s 30 defence.

164Fortunately, I do not need to determine whether this submission is correct. The defendants' reliance upon s 30 also requires me to make findings as to the requirements of s 30(1)(a)-(c) and I can base my findings upon the traditional s 30 basis. I have already concluded that I am satisfied each of the recipients (including the ""republication"" recipients) had an interest in receiving the matter complained of (s 30(1)(a)). Further, or alternatively, I am satisfied they had an apparent interest (s 30(1)(b)): Szanto v Melville [2011] VSC 574 at [148]. This brings me to s 30(1)(c) and whether the defendants' conduct in publishing the matter to each of the recipients was reasonable in the circumstances and to a consideration of the checklist in s 30(3). 

The checklist in s 30(3)

165Although challenging the requirement to do so, the defendants have in fact made submissions in relation to each item in the entire s 30 checklist. I set these out, and the plaintiff's responses, as follows:

(a)s 30(3)(a): The extent to which the matter published is of public interest - the email concerned the productivity of the first defendant and its employees, which was a matter of interest to those to whom it was published (namely the directors and employees of the first defendant). This is not a ""public""interest, but an interest held by all the recipients. The plaintiff did not address this in submissions.

(b)s 30(3)(b): The extent to which the matter published relates to the performance of the public functions or activities of the person - the email related to the performance of the duties and functions of the directors and employees of the first defendant, of which class the plaintiff was a member. The plaintiff's submission was that the email should never have been sent.

(c)s 30(3)(c): Assuming they were carried out by the matter published (which is denied) the seriousness of any defamatory imputation - the defamatory imputations are relatively low in seriousness compared with other defamatory imputations. The plaintiff challenged this element and submitted the imputations were serious, a content I reject.

(d)s 30(3)(d): The extent to which the matter published distinguishes between suspicions, allegations and proven facts - the matter complained of sets out facts about the number of leaves occurring in the month prior to publication of the matter complained of, proves them by annexing the group calendar, and makes observations about the cumulative effect of those absences. It is otherwise directed at a group and casts no suspicions over, makes no allegations about and alleges no facts against the plaintiff in particular. Moreover, it was known to all members of the first defendant that the plaintiff was genuinely sick having been diagnosed with cancer and having been subject to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The plaintiff challenged these matters, asserting that few knew the nature or degree of the plaintiff's illness and asserting errors in the diary. For the reasons set out above, I have accepted the defendants' evidence on this issue.

(e)s 30(3)(e): Whether it was in the public interest in the circumstances for the matter published to be published expeditiously - it was in the interest of the recipients for the matter complained of to be published quickly because the cumulative absences to which the matter complained of referred were having an immediate effect on the first defendant and were placing additional pressure on the company's other employees. The plaintiff challenged these matters, saying that the defendants should not have published the matter at all, or at least without reference to the plaintiff's absences. For the reasons set out above, I have accepted the defendants' evidence on this issue.

(f)s 30(3)(f): The nature of the business environment in which the defendant operates - the defendants were operating a business environment affected by the global financial crisis and otherwise one characterised by pressures associated with ongoing staff absences and punctuality issues and in circumstances where it had customers deadlines to meet. The plaintiff did not address this issue in submissions.

(g)s 30(3)(g): The sources of the information in the matter published and the integrity of those sources - the matter complained of was based upon self-reports by staff (including the plaintiff) as to their attendance at work. The plaintiff challenged the accuracy of the diary but I have accepted that its contents (particularly in relation to the plaintiff) were accurate.

(h)s 30(3)(h): Whether the matter published contained the substance of the person's side of the story and, if not, whether a reasonable attempt was made by the defendant to obtain and publish a response from the person - there was no need to contact the plaintiff because the matter complained of was based upon, among other things, reports by her as to her attendance at work and otherwise is directed at a group, not the plaintiff in the particular and the group calendar was attached to the email. Moreover, it was known to all members of the first defendant that the plaintiff was genuinely sick having been diagnosed with cancer and having been subject to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The defendants also offered the opportunity to discuss the problem at the next staff meeting. The plaintiff challenged this ground on the basis that few knew of her illness and that the diary was to Mr Erbas' own knowledge inaccurate, as he was in the office on a day he was rostered to be out of the office at a meeting. In addition, I note that in LVMH the only inquiry made by the defendant (namely to go into the LVMH store) was made after, not before, publication of the matter complained of.

(i)s 30(3)(i): Any other steps taken to verify the information in the matter published - The second defendant published the email following his direct observations of staff being absent from the office and from information contained in the group calendar and which he attached to the email. The plaintiff challenged this evidence and challenged the failure to consult the plaintiff before publication. However, conformably with LVMH where the inquiry was made after publication (not before), it is no longer necessary to take such steps before publication.

(j)s 30(3)(j): Any other circumstances that the court considers relevant - it was known to all members of the first defendant that the plaintiff was genuinely sick having been diagnosed with cancer and having been subject to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and had been absent and marked as sick at least one whole week in three for some months. The timing of the matter complained of was a Monday morning when almost all the draftspersons were away. Lastly, the matter complained of states in the final paragraph ""We will talk about this at our first staff meeting"". This must mean there cannot be any final judgment about the matters unless or until the meeting is held and there has been discussion and resolution. These matters are relevant, although occurring after (not before) publication, for the reasons explained in LVMH.

166I further note, in relation to s 30(1)(c) and reasonableness, the principal objection raised by the plaintiff, namely that no, or no adequate, enquiry was made of the plaintiff before publication. This has long been a significant problem for media defendants: Austin v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (1985) 3 NSWLR 354 at 364-5.

167In Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden [2002] NSWCA 419 at [1096]ff, the Court of Appeal dismissed a ground of appeal from the finding that it was reasonable to publish in circumstances where the plaintiff had been given an opportunity to respond to the allegations prior to publication (s 22(1)(c) Defamation Act 1974 (NSW)). There was no doubt that Mr Marsden was given an opportunity not merely to respond but to do so in an interview, and that this offer was made prior to, rather than after publication. The Court of Appeal rejected this ground of appeal, noting the very general terms in which the allegations made against Mr Marsden were put before him. Similarly, in Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Hartley [1995] NSWCA 309, where the plaintiff, Mr Hartley, was not only given an opportunity to respond, but his response (limited to a general denial) was published, the failure to do more than publish his denial was found to fall short of this requirement. Like Mr Marsden, Mr Hartley was given only a general indication of what was said.

168However, in LVMH, not only was there no enquiry made prior to publication by the police of imputations of attempted robbery, but the circumstances giving rise to the allegations of attempted robbery (namely, attempting to tamper with shelfs and cabinets in the LVMH store) were never put to the plaintiffs, as is clear from the text of the matter complained of. The police accused the plaintiffs of attempted robbery, and they were then made to sit on the footpath while a police officer entered the shop. The Court of Appeal placed great weight on the fact that one of the plaintiffs made a general denial to the allegation (the other being too intellectually disabled to speak), and considered this was sufficient to comply with s 30. The fact that this denial was at best general in nature, as opposed to an informed response to the specific allegation, and made after publication of the matter complained of, made no difference.

169The approach adopted in LVMH substantially broadens the parameters of this defence (cf. Daily Examiner Pty Ltd v Mundine; Brown v Mundine [2012] NSWCA 195). In the present case, Mr Erbas did indeed prepare the matter complained of without prior consultation of the plaintiff. Indeed, he made no prior consultation of anyone, but simply relied on the diary extract. The defendants submit that that is sufficient. Conformably with the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in LVMH, this must be correct.

170I am satisfied that the defendants have made out each of the items in the s 30 checklist. The s 30 defence has therefore been made out.

Section 33 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW)

171Section 33 provides:

""33 Defence of triviality

It is a defence to the publication of defamatory matter if the defendant proves that the circumstances of publication were such that the plaintiff was unlikely to sustain any harm.""

172The provision ""unlikely to sustain any harm"" is different to the formulation ""not likely to suffer harm"" contained in s 13 Defamation Act 1974 (NSW), which provided:

""13 Unlikelihood of harm

It is a defence that the circumstances of the publication of the matter complained of were such that the person defamed was not likely to suffer harm.""

173The defence of unlikelihood of harm is unique to Australia. As the NSW Law Reform Commission's 1971 Report (which led to the enactment of the 1974 legislation containing s 13), the defence had been available, for slander only, since 1847, ""to meet the hard conditions of pioneer days"": Lang v Willis (1934) 52 CLR 637 at 650 per Rich J. Rich J noted that the jury could take into account the occasion of publication, such as the heat of a family squabble, or a quarrel in a shearing shed. Evatt J added that the jury could consider ""all the aspects of the occasion in question, and they are not debarred from considering the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the particular occasion"" (at 650). McTiernan J added that the fact that the statements were ""untrue in some respects"", or even malicious, was irrelevant (at 683). 

174The defence may arise in circumstances such as the following:

(a)The extent of publication is limited. In Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Limited [1977] 1 NSWLR 749 at 800) the defence was described as ""particularly applicable"" where there is a publication of an informal nature of a trivial imputation.

(b)The knowledge and characteristics of the readers of the publication, who already know the plaintiff and the events in question, which means they are able to make their own judgment: Perkins v Aboriginal Land Council (Supreme Court of NSW, Badgery-Parker J, 15 August 1999) at p. 27; Chappell v Mirror Newspapers Limited (1984) Aust Torts Rep 80-691 at 68,948; Morosi at 800). In particular, where the recipients of the publication have a close relationship, such as the relationship between a company and its directors, ""the defence of unlikelihood of harm (s 13) will succeed"": State Bank of NSW v Currabubula Holdings Pty Ltd & Anor (2001) NSWCA 47 at 114 per Giles JA. This is why it is important for the plaintiff to be able to define all recipients of the libel, as Badgery-Parker J pointed out in Perkins at 27.

(c)Where the ""quality of the publication"" can be considered ""in respect of its proneness to cause harm"" (Chappell v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (1984) Aust Torts Reports 80-691 at 86,947-86,948). This enquiry is directed to the moment of publication. Actionability does not depend upon an enquiry as to what thereafter happens, and in particular as to whether or not harm in fact resulted from the publication. 

(d)Where the imputations are of a lesser seriousness. However, it has been considered to be potentially available to imputations of thieving (King & Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd v McKenzie (1991) 24 NSWLR 305), promiscuity (Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Ltd), racism (Chappell v Mirror Newspapers Ltd) or indeed any imputation which would otherwise satisfy the criteria set out in (a) to (c) above. 

175This brings me to the question of the applicable test for s 33. Mr Evatt submitted that the difference between ss 33 and 13 of the repealed legislation picks up the language of Mahoney JA in King & Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd v McKenzie (1991) 24 NSWLR 305.

176Mahoney JA's enunciation of this principle was endorsed in Skalkos v Assaf [2002] NSWCA 14 at [73]. Mason P, dismissing the appeal, concurred with the trial judge, who had ""pointed out that the test identified by Mahoney JA in King & Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd v McKenzie (at 309) was that the defendant bore the significant burden of negativing not merely that there would be great or substantial harm but that there be ""harm"" at all."" However, in Jones v Sutton (2004) 61 NSWLR 614, King & Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd v McKenzie, supra, was distinguished on the basis firstly that it was obiter (at 620), and secondly that Mahoney JA meant that ""what had to be negatived was that there was ""likely to be harm at all"""" (at 620). Jones v Sutton, rather than King & Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd v McKenzie, supra, is now generally cited as the correct test to apply.

177However, the plaintiff's written submissions (paragraphs 45-48) now take issue with the applicability of Jones v Sutton, supra, on the basis that the formula in s 33 picks up the language of Mahoney JA. It is submitted that s 33 required that ""the plaintiff was unlikely to sustain any harm"" (written submissions, paragraph 46). Mr Evatt submits that the interpretation given to the defence of triviality by Mahoney JA has been preserved by this changed wording in s 33.

178Other judges have taken this approach. In Papaconstuntinos v Holmes a Court [2009] NSWSC 903 at [105], McCallum J adopted this interpretation of s 33, stating that ""the defence requires the defendant to show not merely that there is unlikely to be great or substantial harm but that there is unlikely to be any harm at all: King & Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd v McKenzie, supra, at 309G per Mahoney JA."" While this decision was set aside on other grounds, the correctness of her Honour's reasoning on s 33 was not the subject of any scrutiny or comment either in the NSW Court of Appeal or in the High Court. Accordingly, the approach taken by McCallum J, which restores the approach taken by Mahoney JA in King & Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd v McKenzie, supra, is the correct approach.

179The next point Mr Evatt makes is, however, controversial. He goes on to submit that the word ""any"" must include upset and hurt to feelings, which distinguishes this new section from the exclusion of these items in paragraph 38 of Jones v Sutton.

180There is a helpful discussion of this issue in Szanto v Melville [2011] VSC 574 at [157]-[164]. In those proceedings, the difference in wording between s 13 of the repealed legislation and s 33 of the Act was not drawn to the attention of the trial judge, and the attack made on whether ""any harm"" included ""injury to feelings"" was brought upon a different basis. Kaye J, noting the apparent inconsistency between Jones v Sutton and the concept of ""any harm"" excluding injury to feelings, in the context of the desirability of consistency in the construction of the uniform defamation legislation (at [163]) ultimately did not express a concluded view, on the basis that, if the word ""harm"" was confined to damage to reputation, nevertheless the defendant would not make out the defence under s 33 (at [164]).

181I accept Mr Evatt's submission that the change of wording means that I should adopt the process of analysis used by McCallum J in Papaconstuntinos v Holmes a Court, supra. I note that the word ""harm"" as used in ss 34 and 36 appears to encompass both injury to reputation and injury to feelings; the word ""harm"" is used in both the repealed and the current legislation. However, I consider I am bound by the statement of Beazley JA in Jones v Sutton (2004) 61 NSWLR 614; [2004] NSWCA 439 at [38] that whether or not a person's feelings were hurt was ""not relevant to s 13"", because it is a matter for damages. This is notwithstanding the fact that in both the repealed legislation and the Act the wording for the defence of contextual truth specifically refers to defamatory imputations which do not further ""harm the reputation"" of, as opposed to ""harm"", the plaintiff. Kaye J noted in Szanto v Melville (at [163]) that it is clear the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Jones v Sutton regarded the word ""harm"" as confined to injury to reputation. It was a problem about which Kaye J, noting the attractive submissions to the contrary, ultimately did not express a concluded view.

182As was the case for Kaye J, ultimately it is not necessary for me to express a concluded view as to whether the submissions made by Mr Evatt at paragraphs 45-46 are correct because, on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the plaintiff suffered neither ""harm"" to reputation nor hurt to feelings. 

183I am satisfied that the plaintiff did not suffer harm to reputation because of the very unusual circumstances of the publication, namely an email from an employer to all of his employees about all of their conduct in relation to the taking of holiday and sick leave and coming to work late. In addition, I am satisfied that she did not suffer hurt to feelings as claimed.

184In relation to hurt to feelings, it is open to a trial judge, for the reasons explained in Jones v Sutton (No. 2) [2005] NSWCA 203, to make findings about the degree of hurt to feelings on a credit basis and in relation to damages. The unsatisfactory evidence of the plaintiff about when she first learned of the matter complained of, and my rejection of her evidence of telling Mr Erbas about it, are set out in full above. This was a finding I made in relation to damages issues. However, if applied to the findings necessary for the s 33 defence, this would mean that I am satisfied that the plaintiff did not suffer any upset and hurt to feelings, which means that she did not suffer ""any harm"" of any kind in relation to s 33.

185In relation to harm to the plaintiff's reputation, if this email was seen by the 20 co-workers of the plaintiff, all of whom I have found knew the reasons for the plaintiff's absence from work, I am satisfied that this is one of those rare cases where the plaintiff would not suffer any harm at all. If the email was seen by all the persons to whom the plaintiff showed it (the ""republication"" claim), this would make no difference.

186In Currabubula Giles J noted the close relationship between a company and its director; in Jones v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd at 366E - G Hunt J noted academic discussion as to whether inter-company publications are publications at all. Inter-office emails of this kind, where the parties know the full background and the issues involved (and may themselves be included amongst those under criticism) are the kind of publication which should benefit from this defence. I accept the defendants' submission as to relevance of such matters, as discussed in Perkins v New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Badgery-Parker J, 15 August 1997). This defence is accordingly made out.

Conclusions as to liability

187I formally note that at paragraph 49 of the plaintiff's submissions, Mr Evatt states that he has not answered ""a number of bizarre matters"" raised in the amended defence as they have not been the subject of submissions. I formally note that I have not dealt with these either. There has been a degree of ""unnecessary clutter"" (Sun Earth Homes Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Corp (1993) 45 FCR 265) in the pleadings of both parties.

188All of the defences (qualified privilege at common law, statutory qualified privilege and triviality) have succeeded. Judgment will be entered for the defendants. I make brief observations as to the appropriate range of damages if damages were to be awarded.

General damages

189General damages in defamation proceedings comprise injury to feelings, damage to reputation and vindication: Carson v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1993) 178 CLR 44 at 60. In determining the amount of damages the court should take into account s 34 in the manner explained by Hayne JA in Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2003) 216 CLR 327 at [60] in relation to s 46A Defamation Act 1974 (NSW), which contained similar provisions. Section 35 of the Act also places a limit on the maximum amount of damages for non-economic loss, which is currently $339,000 (Gazette No. 60 of 8.6.2012, p 2369). In addition, regard may be had to awards in other actions for defamation. 

190Other defamation decisions dealing with issues of damages have referred to the lack of helpfulness of other defamation awards in arriving at a figure for general damages (Leech v Green & Gold Energy Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 999 at [29] per Fullerton J). Damages awards vary widely for limited publications such as office emails. The highest verdict for a business letter sent to members of an organisation is Manefield v Association of Quality Child Care Centres (NSW) [2010] NSWSC 1420 where Kirby J awarded $150,000 for a letter was sent to around 650 members of an association. An appeal as to quantum was dismissed: Association of Quality Child Care Centres (NSW) v Manefield [2012] NSWCA 123. At the other end of the scale are the damages awarded in Bristow v Adams [2012] NSWCA 166 (namely $10,000) for an inter-office email sent to several branch offices of a company. These awards included a claim for aggravated compensatory damages.

191One factor I cannot take into account is that the plaintiff commenced proceedings only four days prior to the expiry of the limitation period. Failure to commence proceedings for a long period has been considered significant in a number of cases (e.g. McCarey v Associated Newspapers Ltd (No 2) [1965] 2 QB 86). However, the plaintiff was not cross-examined about her reasons for delay, as Mr Evatt has pointed out, so I must disregard this factor.

192I similarly reject the defendants' submission (written submissions, paragraph 8.15) that failure to send a ""letter of demand"" (which I infer is a concerns notice) or a request for an apology should reduce the award. Nor do I accept the defendants' submission that the imputations cover the same ground and should be discounted for that reason. The imputations differ in substance, and convey a separate sting.

193This was an inter-office email to 20 staff members complaining that many of them had been absent from the office in circumstances which hurt the company and their fellow employees, and that something had to be done about it. Communications of this kind are part and parcel of business activities and the imputations are at the bottom of the range in terms of seriousness.

194Taking all of the above into account, I consider an appropriate award for damages, if damages were to be awarded for all five imputations, would be $10,000 for this ""veritable tempest in a teacup"" (Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG (1985) 1 NSWLR 188 at 190 per Hunt J). If an award were to be made for imputation (c)-(e) only, an appropriate amount would be $5,000 (comparable to the sum Simpson J considered appropriate in Haddon v Forsyth [2011] NSWSC 123 for emails to members of a church community). This would include any award made for the ""republications"", either as causes of action in themselves or as matters going to damages only.

195Given the circumstances of the publication (an inter-office email) and the absences of any aggravating features, I would not award aggravated compensatory damages.

Costs

196As s 40 issues, and matters arising in the course of the hearing (Jones v Sutton (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 203) may be relevant as to costs, I have reserved the issue of costs for further argument.

Orders

(1)Judgment for the defendants.

(2)Costs reserved, with liberty to apply.

(3)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

2419357,Health Care Complaints Commission v Rolleston [2013] NSWMT 12,"Judgment

1Dr John Philip Rolleston (the respondent) is a 75 year old medical practitioner, who commenced to practise medicine in 1968. By an Amended Complaint, the Health Care Complaints Commission (the HCCC), alleges that the respondent has been convicted of criminal offences (Complaint One); that the respondent has been guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct in that he engaged in improper or unethical conduct relating to the practice or purported practice of medicine (Complaint Two); that the respondent has been guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct in that he contravened conditions to which his registration was subject (Complaint Three); that the respondent is guilty of professional misconduct within the terms of section 139E of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (the National Law) (Complaint Four) and that the respondent is not a suitable person to hold registration in the medical profession (Complaint Five).

2The offences the subject of the criminal convictions, and the further complaints made by a number of patients each alleged inappropriate contact of a sexual nature, involving the respondent masturbating the teenage boys, or alternatively, requiring them to masturbate themselves in his presence, usually until they ejaculated. A number of the complaints involved the assertion that the respondent fondled the testicles of the young men, or moved his fingers rapidly in and out of their anus at the same time as masturbating them. All these events occurred in the context of a medical consultation, where the boys presented with symptoms generally of an unrelated nature, such as asthma or acne.

3The respondent admits each of the five complaints (as particularised) and concedes that his conduct calls into question his suitability to hold registration in the medical profession. Specifically, the respondent adheres to his earlier stated intention not to seek renewal of his registration when it fell due.

Background

4In 1958, the respondent graduated Bachelor of Pharmacy from the University of Sydney. In 1967, he graduated Bachelor of Medicine Bachelor of Surgery from University of Sydney. After completing an internship, the respondent was employed at the Sutherland Hospital and thereafter at Mona Vale Hospital as a Resident Medical Officer.

5In 1969, the respondent commenced to practise as a general practitioner at St Ives, Sydney. He became a partner in a firm of general practitioners, and continued at the practice until late 1979. Thereafter, the respondent left that practice to commence as the Medical Director of the Accident and Emergency Department at the Royal North Shore Hospital, where he remained until mid-1983. Between 1983 and early 1987, the respondent was in general practice at Mt Druitt, Sydney.

6In 1975, the respondent was convicted of nine offences pertaining to the pharmaceutical provisions of the National Health Act, in respect of offences which occurred in 1971 and 1972. No action was taken at that time in regard to his medical registration.

7In April 1986, the respondent was convicted in the New South Wales District Court of 12 counts of issuing false documents, which were capable of being used in relation to an application for a payment under the Health Insurance Act and fined a total of $17,000 and sentenced to one year term of imprisonment, but was released on a five-year good behaviour bond. On 27 February 1987, the respondent was found guilty of professional misconduct (consequent upon his convictions), and his name was removed from the Register of Medical Practitioners, following a hearing before the New South Wales Medical Tribunal.

8In October 1990, the respondent successfully applied to have his name restored to the Register of Medical Practitioners, on a conditional basis, i.e. he could only practice within the hospital system, and did not enjoy the right of private practice for a period of two years.

9Between October 1990 and February 1993, the respondent was employed in various hospitals in Sydney and thereafter in Broken Hill. In February 1993, the respondent's conditional registration was removed. Accordingly, he became entitled to work as a general practitioner in private practice.

10Between 1993 and early 1997, the respondent was the Director of Medical Services at the Broken Hill Hospital. Between 1997 and 25 March 2010, the respondent established and worked as a principal in the Broken Hill Medical Centre.

11On 2 April 2008, the respondent advised the Board on his annual renewal form that in July 2007, he had been convicted of a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol. He was fined and disqualified from driving for three months. In 2004, the respondent had been stopped, but not charged for a low range PCA offence. In 2008, the respondent was assessed in relation to a drinking problem and found not to be suffering from an impairment.

12In June 2009, the practitioner appeared at an Inquiry convened by the Medical Board of New South Wales in accordance with section 66 of the Medical Practice Act 1992 (repealed). The proceedings were convened in relation to a number of complaints alleging that the respondent had assaulted adolescent boys during the 1970s. The allegations related to the period in which the respondent was working as a general practitioner in St Ives and in his early years working in the Emergency Department at Royal North Shore Hospital.

13The first complaint was received in 1998, and there were a number of investigations since that time by the HCCC, and the New South Wales Medical Board. The delegates to the Inquiry decided on 25 June 2009, that pending a full investigation of the allegations, it was appropriate to impose conditions on the respondent's registration, in order to protect the health and safety of the public. Those conditions prohibited the respondent from providing any medical services at all, to patients between the ages of 11 and 18 years inclusive. The conditions further required that a chaperone be present at all times during his provision of medical services to any patient between the ages of 0 and 10 years. There were additional conditions affecting the way in which the two principal practice restrictions were to function.

14The respondent's response to the allegations considered by the Inquiry was ""a blanket denial that he has not ever molested any patient at St Ives or elsewhere"". The complainants were Patients E, G and D. The delegates concluded, correctly in our opinion, that whilst the events were alleged to have occurred in the 1970s, this in itself did not mean that the health and safety of persons were not now potentially at risk, or that action was not now otherwise required in the public interest.

15On 3 July 2009, the respondent was arrested and charged with 11 counts of indecent assault against four males between 11 and 15 years of age in the 1970s. In September 2009, the HCCC notified the Board of allegations of indecent assault made by a number of males of similar age also in the 1970s. The complainants in the latter allegations were Patients K, C, J, B, A, I and H.

16In January 2010, the Board wrote to the respondent in relation to a significant number of discrepancies between the entries recorded in his monthly chaperone logs with data supplied by Medicare Australia regarding medical services he rendered to patients aged 18 years or younger. The information suggested that he had consulted with four patients aged between 11 and 18 years, which raised concern about a breach of the condition relating to age restrictions on patients (Practice Condition 2). The data also suggested that he had consulted with 22 patients aged 10 years or younger.

17The respondent accepted that he was in breach of his conditions. However, he expressed complete surprise as he had thought that he had already put in place the ""necessary controls"". The respondent however, stated that all patients had been properly chaperoned and that the only errors were in the paperwork. He was unable to explain why there had been so many errors in the relevant period. Furthermore, the respondent asserted that in some cases, the patient was just short of 19 years of age, in other cases, the patient had been incorrectly billed as his consultation rather than that of a colleague and these had been honest mistakes.

18The delegates stated that ""meticulous compliance with such conditions was fundamental, as it is the only means by which the Board can satisfy itself that the conditions are serving to protect the health and safety of the public"". They considered that his behaviour amounted to a flagrant disregard of the intent of the conditions on his registration, as well as the specific reporting requirements.

19The Inquiry was told that in early July 2009, the respondent was arrested and charged in relation to 11 indecent assaults. The delegates observed that ""the charges are of an extremely serious nature and relate directly to professional standards and to the public's expectation of medical professionals who hold positions of particular trust"". Given all these matters, the delegates considered that the suspension for a period of eight weeks was appropriate and necessary, being satisfied that it was appropriate to do so for the protection of the health and safety of the public, alternatively that the action was otherwise in the public interest.

Complaints

20On 24 June 2011 after a trial in the District Court, the respondent was sentenced by Flannery DCJ in respect of 10 counts of indecent assault upon a male pursuant to section 81 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Also dealt with in those proceedings, was a further indictment alleging seven counts of indecent assault of a male, to which the respondent pleaded guilty. Two of the seven counts were placed on a Form 1. The maximum penalty for an offence under section 81 was five years imprisonment.

21In the sentencing remarks, Flannery DCJ noted that the respondent or one of his colleagues in the practice at St Ives, was the family doctor for 10 of the 12 victims. The other two victims consulted the respondent when he was working at the Royal North Shore Hospital. The offences occurred in the course of consultations between 31 December 1969 and 1 January 1982, at the respondent's surgery, the hospital, and during house calls. At the time of the offences, the victims were all teenage boys aged between 12 to 16 years of age. 

22In relation to these offences, her Honour imposed an aggregate sentence of four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months, the latter to expire on 23 December 2012.

23On 27 March 2012, the respondent was charged with a further four offences of indecent assault upon a male (the victims being Patients Q, R, S and T), and after entering pleas of guilty, was sentenced by Flannery DCJ on 9 November 2012. There were two additional matters placed on a Form One, which her Honour took into account. Her Honour imposed an aggregate sentence of 14 months to expire on 23 March 2013. These were the convictions relied upon to support Complaint One, and as we have earlier noted, the respondent admitted this complaint. We are comfortably satisfied that this complaint has been established to the requisite degree cf Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336.

24Complaint Two alleges that the respondent is guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct in that he engaged in improper or unethical conduct relating to the practice or purported practice of medicine. The Complaint is particularised in that between 1 January 1969 and 1 January 1982, the respondent indecently assaulted Patients A to T during consultations by those patients with the respondent for medical services and which were conducted at the respondent's surgery, in hospital or at the patients' homes during house calls. The respondent admitted this complaint. We are comfortably satisfied that this complaint has been established.

25Complaint Three alleges that the respondent has been guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct in that he has contravened conditions to which his registration was subject. As has been noted above, on 23 June 2009, the NSW Medical Board imposed Practice Conditions upon the respondent's registration, which prohibited the respondent providing medical services to any patient aged between 11 and 18 years inclusive (Practice Condition 2). It was also a requirement that a third person ""the chaperone"" be present at all times during any provision of medical services relating to patients aged from 0 to 10 years (Practice Condition 3). Finally, the respondent was required to keep a chaperone record, requiring the contemporaneous signatures of each chaperone (Practice Condition 4). 

26The complaint alleges that between mid-August 2009 and 30 October 2009, the respondent contravened Practice Condition 2 in that he provided medical services to Patients M, N and O, who were then 18 years of age. Further, the complaint alleges that between July and October 2009, the respondent contravened Practice Condition 4 in that he failed to keep a chaperone record as required, for 22 patients between the ages of 0 and 10 to whom he provided medical services in that period. The respondent admitted this complaint. We are comfortably satisfied that this complaint has been established and endorse the observations of the delegates in the section 66 Inquiry at paragraph [19] above.

27Complaint Four alleges that the respondent is guilty of professional misconduct in that he engaged in unsatisfactory professional conduct of a sufficiently serious nature to justify the suspension or cancellation of his registration or alternatively that he engaged in more than one instance of unsatisfactory professional conduct, of sufficient seriousness to warrant a similar result. The respondent admitted that he was guilty of professional misconduct. We are comfortably satisfied that this complaint has been established.

28Complaint Five alleges that the respondent is not a suitable person to hold registration in the medical profession. The particulars to this complaint set out the underlying conduct, which supports the offences in respect of which the respondent had been convicted and sentenced. The Tribunal does not propose to set out in considerable detail each of the incidents involving the patients with whom the respondent interfered. In taking this course of action, we do not wish it to be taken that the effect of the respondent's conduct upon the individual patients was insignificant or did not cause long-lasting prejudicial effects upon them. 

29These matters were more fully dealt with by her Honour Flannery DCJ in the judgments her Honour gave in 2011 and 2012. In her remarks on 24 June 2011, her Honour stated:

Eight of the 12 victims prepared Victim Impact Statements. ... No one could fail to be moved by their content. The statements describe a loss of trust in authority figures, depression and anxiety, achieving less in life than might have been expected, alcohol and drug dependence and the loss of meaningful relationships.

Furthermore, her Honour noted in her remarks on 9 November 2012 that two of the victims with whom she was dealing, ""continue to be affected by the offending as a result of the confusion, anger and embarrassment caused"". 

Given the number of complaints and the similarity in the circumstances in which they occurred, the facts disclose a depressing similarity about the modus operandi adopted by the respondent in interfering with teenage boys, for what some of the evidence suggests, was for his own sexual gratification.

30Patient A was aged 13 to 15 years when the assaults occurred. Between 31 December 1974 and 1 January 1977, he visited the respondent at his surgery for medical attention. The respondent asked Patient A to lie down and then removed Patient A's pants. The respondent masturbated Patient A by stroking his penis until he ejaculated. Patient A felt awkward and embarrassed, but because he trusted the respondent, he thought that this was part of the treatment. Patient A did not say anything at the time, because he was "" young and naive, but most of all I had placed my trust in him"".

31Patient B was aged 14 to 15 years and was indecently assaulted by the respondent between 31 December 1975 and 1 January 1977. The assault occurred in the course of a consultation at the respondent's surgery. The respondent told Patient B that he required a semen sample, and when he was unable to produce the same, the respondent squeezed clear gel onto the patient's penis and manipulated it with his hand. The respondent then squeezed the patient's penis and applied to a stick to collect what he said was a sample.

32Patient C was aged 12 to 15 years. On two occasions between December 1975 and January 1978, Patient C visited the respondent at his surgery in relation to acne and asthma problems. Under the pretext of checking his hormone levels, the respondent masturbated Patient C to the point of ejaculation. On one occasion, the respondent asked the patient whether he wished his girlfriend was doing ""this"" (masturbating Patient C). He then purported to take a sample of the semen. Patient C stated that in later years, he commenced getting angry and emotional about what had occurred.

33Patient D was aged approximately 15 years. Between December 1977 and June 1979, Patient D was indecently assaulted on four occasions by the respondent at his surgery. On each occasion, the respondent masturbated Patient D to the point of ejaculation. On two further occasions between April 1979 and January 1982, the respondent, indecently assaulted Patient D in a similar manner at Royal North Shore Hospital. Subsequent to these assaults, Patient D noted that his school grades began to drop, and the repercussions of the incidents continue to affect him until the present day.

34Patient E was aged 14 to 15 years. On 24 July 1979, he was taken to the Emergency Department of the Royal North Shore Hospital following an accident in the school playground. The respondent examined Patient E stating he wanted to check if there was any blood in his anus or semen. The respondent stroked the patient's penis and inserted a finger of his gloved hand into the patient's anus and moved vigorously around for approximately 2 minutes. The respondent withdrew his finger and invited the patient to masturbate himself. Thereafter the respondent again placed his finger in the patient's anus whilst the patient was masturbating himself and invited the patient to tell him when he was ""going to come"". Patient E stated that he was overwhelmed and confused, felt very upset, and was bewildered as to what exactly happened. In 1997, Patient E first disclosed the assault to his general practitioner and commenced to have frequent anxiety attacks, resulting in his consulting a psychiatrist and a psychologist for treatment.

35Patient F was aged 12 to 13 years. Between December 1973 and January 1977, the respondent indecently assaulted the patient on three occasions by masturbating Patient F to the point of ejaculation. These events occurred, on one occasion at the patient's home during a house call, and on the other two occasions at the respondent's surgery. Patient F stated that on at least one occasion, he felt the respondent's erect penis proximate to his right arm. Patient F did not disclose these matters at the time, because he was ashamed, and thought that somehow he encouraged the behaviour, even though he felt embarrassed and confused at the time.

36Patient G was aged approximately 12 years and 14 years respectively. On two occasions between December 1973 and 1 January 1976, the patient consulted the respondent on the first occasion at his surgery in relation to the flu, and on the second occasion during a house call. During these consultations, the respondent indecently assaulted the patient by masturbating him to the point of ejaculation. As a result of these events, Patient G has consulted a number of psychiatrists and attended at various mental health departments, stating that it has taken many years for him to gain trust in doctors.

37Patient H was approximately 16 years of age. Between December 1973 and January 1977, the patient attended upon the respondent at the Royal North Shore Hospital in relation to gastrointestinal problems. In the course of the purported examination, the respondent applied lubricant to the patient's penis and masturbated him for several minutes. At the time that these events occurred, the patient thought that there was medical justification for the procedure. It was only when he was in his mid-20s, that Patient H realised he had been abused.

38Patient I was aged approximately 13 to 14 years. On five occasions between February 1975 and January 1976, the patient attended at the respondent's surgery for medical attention in relation to bronchitis and other issues. On each occasion, the respondent masturbated Patient I and on at least one occasion, this caused him significant discomfort. On a further occasion, the respondent commenced to play with the patient's testicles for a number of minutes.

39Patient J was aged between 14 and 16 years. On two occasions between December 1973 and January 1977, the patient attended at the respondent's surgery for medical attention. On both occasions, the respondent masturbated the patient until he ejaculated, for the stated purpose of providing a semen sample. Patient J did not disclose the abuse because he thought that it involved proper medical procedures. He said that in later years, he became angry at the respondent, because the latter had abused a position of trust and took advantage of him as a young person.

40Patient K was aged approximately 16 years. On one occasion, between December 1969 and January 1971, the patient attended at the respondent's surgery for medical attention in relation to glandular fever. The respondent told the patient that he would have to collect a full range of samples including blood and semen samples. The patient was told that a semen sample was required, and the respondent commenced to masturbate him. Patient K indicated that he preferred to undertake the procedure himself, but when he was unable to ejaculate, the respondent applied a black rubber ring and forced it over the patient's erect penis causing him pain. Ignoring Patient K's pleas for him to stop, the respondent masturbated the patient in a furious manner until he ejaculated causing the patient pain. As a result of the incident, Patient K's penis had a deep rounded groove around the shaft, where the rubber ring had been, and a large blue coloured bubble like a blister on head of the penis, which remained very sore and swollen for some days. Patient K stated that at the time of the assault, he was fragile, emotionally affected, ashamed and guilty. He lost his confidence and developed low self-esteem.

41Patient L was aged approximately 15 years. On three occasions between December 1973 and January 1977, the patient attended at the respondent's surgery for medical attention in relation to minor ailments and a common cold. The respondent indecently assaulted the patient by masturbating him on each occasion. The patient did not disclose the abuse at the time, although he realised it was wrong.

42Patient Q was approximately 16 years of age. On one occasion, between January 1969 and December 1970, the patient attended at the respondent's surgery for medical attention. The respondent on two occasions masturbated the patient. He produced a ""girlie"" magazine, but Patient Q could not ejaculate. The patient did not report the abuse at the time, although he felt guilty and embarrassed about the incident.

43Patient R aged between 16 and 18 years of age. On two occasions between January 1970 and December 1972, the patient attended at the respondent's surgery. On both occasions, the respondent masturbated patient to the point of ejaculation. He appeared to test the semen. On the second occasion, the respondent took a blood sample from Patient R.

44It is no small irony that Patient R later studied medicine and became a medical practitioner. At the time of the second consultation, Patient R was a medical student. Nevertheless, he submitted to the assault, although he felt uncomfortable, but still trusted the respondent's professional knowledge and ability. Indeed, the patient spent one week of his general practice placement at the respondent's surgery in the middle years of his medical training. At a later time, when he eventually realised that what had occurred was not a proper medical procedure, Patient R was working at the Royal North Shore Hospital as a junior colleague to the respondent. He expressed a sense of shame and therefore, did not discuss the details of the sexual abuse inflicted upon him.

45Patient R regretted that he did not come forward earlier, but he stated that he still felt uncomfortable about such a public disclosure and its potential effect on his family. However, since that time, Patient R has become a strong advocate for the protection of children and young people from sexual and other abuse.

46Patient S was aged between 11 and 13 years. On one occasion, between January 1973 and December 1975, he attended at the respondent's surgery for medical attention for a cold or flu. The respondent told him that he required ""some fluid from his penis"" and masturbated him for 10 to 15 minutes. The patient failed to get an erection. The patient stated that whilst he viewed the incident with mild suspicion, it seemed to him that the likelihood of a doctor abusing a young patient was so unlikely that he thought that he had misconstrued the respondent's actions.

47Patient T was aged between 11 and 13 years. On an occasion between July 1976 and December 1977, the patient attended at the respondent surgery. The respondent stated that he needed a semen sample. Patient T commenced to masturbate and the respondent then came and took over. The respondent appeared to become frustrated and said: ""try harder"" and ""I really need this"". Due to his age, Patient T did not understand what was happening and therefore did not complain.

48In summary, the respondent's misconduct took place between 1969 and 1982, a period of 13 years, and involved 33 offences of indecent assault on 16 teenage boys. The Tribunal is comfortably satisfied that the respondent acted in the manner set out above. 

49In each case, the respondent indecently assaulted his young patients in the guise of rendering legitimate medical treatment. In each case, he used his position as a trusted medical practitioner to gain access to young and impressionable boys, no doubt for his own sexual gratification, and without regard to the well-being of his patients. The conduct took place over a significant period of time, and it has had a profound and lasting effect upon many of the victims. The degree of abuse of trust and the dominance in the relationship of a medical practitioner over his patients, is emphasised by the trust reposed in the respondent by Patient R, who himself became a medical practitioner, but nevertheless trusted the respondent, whilst he himself was abused as a medical student. There is little doubt that the respondent's behaviour constituted a gross dereliction of his obligations as a medical practitioner. 

50The HCCC relies upon this conduct to establish that the respondent is not a suitable person to hold registration in the medical profession. The Tribunal notes that the National Law does not define the words ""suitable"" or ""unsuitable"". That law, however, indicates that in given circumstances, the National Board may have regard to a person's criminal history (as relevant to his/her professional practice) to assess the suitability of an applicant for registration - section 55 (1). 

51Care must always be taken when having regard to cases, which turn upon different legislation. However, some guidance can be obtained from the decision of the Court of Appeal in HCCC v Litchfield (1991) 41 NSWLR 630, which considered counterpart provisions of the Medical Practice Act 1992 (repealed). In that case, the Medical Tribunal determined that a medical practitioner had engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct towards three female patients and suspended him from practice. The practitioner had been acquitted on criminal charges arising from the same facts. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and determined that the practitioner's conduct warranted his name being removed from the register.

52The Court of Appeal considered that the Tribunal had failed to properly exercise its discretion. It had taken into account that the events were of ""considerable antiquity"" - however, the Court noted that the inappropriate conduct had involved three different female patients in three different places at different times. The doctor had denied he had committed the conduct alleged and the proceedings were strongly defended. The doctor did not offer any explanation which ""made it unlikely that the conduct would occur again"". Furthermore, ""there was nothing to suggest that the doctor had become a changed person ..."". The Court referred to the absence of any admission of guilt or expression of contrition. Nor was there any claim that the incidents were some isolated or passing departure from proper professional standards.

53The Court of Appeal concluded: ""In cases such as this, the Tribunal and this Court should not assume that the doctor has become a reformed person. ... Disciplinary proceedings against members of a profession are intended to maintain proper ethical and professional standards, primarily for the protection of the public, but also for the protection of the profession.""

54Some but not all these considerations apply in the present case. There has been a significant lapse of time between 1982 and the present. There is nothing to suggest that the respondent continued his misconduct after that time. However he did defend the earlier matters before Flannery DCJ, only pleading guilty after he was found guilty after trial. His expression of contrition is perfunctory and fails to acknowledge the harm he has caused to the victims. Furthermore, and most importantly, there is no explanation as to why this conduct took place. In our view, these considerations are significant in determining whether or not (age aside), there is a prospect of recurrence of the relevant misconduct. 

55The Tribunal accepts the submission of the HCCC that there was a disproportionate power imbalance in the relationship on two levels: that of doctor-patient and that of an adult and minor. Furthermore, we accept that, absent any explanation for his misconduct, the Tribunal cannot make an assessment as to whether the respondent had any insight into his misconduct or any motivation to remedy the underlying causes. 

56Accordingly, the Tribunal is comfortably satisfied that the respondent is not currently a suitable person to practise medicine. This is because the respondent's history as set out above shows grave deficiencies in his professional conduct: his conviction in 1986 for offences involving fraud in the practice of medicine indicate a lack of honesty and integrity; the indecent assaults underpinning, many of the current complaints, indicate his present unsuitability to deal professionally with younger patients; and his failure to abide by the Practice Conditions, indicate his lack of appreciation or insight of the need to protect younger members of the public from his misconduct. In short, the respondent has demonstrated that he lacks the capacity to place the needs and well-being of his patients over his personal inclinations.

57The Medical Profession is an honourable profession dedicated to curing those with illness and injury and alleviating pain. The Australian Medical Association Code of Ethics - 2004, states that the code has grown out of other similar ethical codes stretching back into history including the Hippocratic Oath. The Code states as follows:

Because of the special knowledge and expertise, doctors have a responsibility to improve and maintain the health of their patients who, either in a vulnerable state of illness or for the maintenance of their health, entrust themselves to medical care.

The doctor-patient relationship is itself a partnership based on mutual respect and collaboration.

58The Code embodies the principles that the doctor must consider first the well-being of the patient; he or she must treat the patient with compassion and respect; the doctor must make sure that he or she does not exploit the patient for any reason, and the doctor should avoid engaging in sexual activity with the patient.

59At least one translation of the Hippocratic Oath includes the following:

I will apply dietetic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judgment; I will keep them from harm and injustice.

...

Whatever houses I may visit, I will come for the benefit of the sick, remaining free of all intentional injustice, or mischief, and in particular of sexual relations with both female and male persons ...

60The principle which guides the proper practice of his profession is set out in section 3 of the National Law which refers to the rationale behind the National regulation and accreditation of health practitioners in terms of the protection of the public by ensuring that health practitioners are suitably competent and act ethically - section 3 (2) (a).

61The effective functioning of the profession relies upon a relationship of trust between doctor and patient. The patient may confide many private and delicate matters, which may be of an embarrassing and confidential nature. Furthermore, a patient reposes such trust in the doctor, which permits the latter to view and touch intimate parts of the patient's anatomy and to do things which in other circumstances may constitute a criminal offence. This invasion of privacy is permitted by patients, because of the close nature of the relationship and because the patient believes that the doctor is acting in pursuit of a higher purpose of assisting the patient in relation to his or her illness or injury and not out of personal gratification or self-interest.

62Absent this relationship of trust, the doctor-patient relationship is rendered less effective in achieving those noble objects, if unworkable. Every doctor who breaches that relationship contributes to a wider scepticism amongst the community that the medical profession is indeed an honourable one, dedicated to these ideals.

63As the Court of Appeal noted in Litchfield at page 638:

Female patients entrust themselves to doctors, male and female, for medical examinations and treatment which may require intimate physical contact which they would not otherwise accept from the doctor. The standards of the profession oblige doctors to use the opportunities afforded them for such contact for proper therapeutic purposes and not otherwise. This is the standard that the public in general and female patients in particular expect from their doctors, and which right-thinking members of the profession observe, and expect their colleagues to observe.

64In our view, these statements apply with equal force to male patients, including teenage boys. Furthermore, the observations of Priestley JA in Richter v. Walton Court of Appeal (15 July 1993, unreported), at pages 8 and 9, apply in the present case:

The degree of trust, which patients necessarily give to their doctors may vary according to the condition which takes the patient to the doctor. Even in regard to the most commonplace medical matters the trust a patient places in a doctor is considerable. In some cases, ... the patient's trust cannot help but be almost absolute. The doctor's power in regard to the patient in such cases is also very great. I do not mean power in an abstract way, but as a matter of fact; the extent of the power will vary according to the temperament of the patient, but the doctor with some patients and for limited periods, because of the relationship in which they are temporarily placed, is in a position to do whatever the doctor wants with the body of the patient. This is one of the reasons why doctors are subject to correspondingly great obligations, and are expected to maintain very high standards: all this being very much in the public interest.

65Finally, it is useful to recall the statement of Viscount Simon LC in General Medical Council v Spackman [1943] AC 627, where his Lordship stated:

The high reputation of the medical profession as a whole depends in no small measure on excluding from that those whose professional misconduct make them unworthy to belong to it, and the confidence which the public are accustomed to put in the family doctor is intimately connected with the assurance that those who practise the art of medicine are, in all relations with their patients, individuals of the highest honour.

66Apart from pleading guilty to various but not all of the criminal offences, and not contesting the proceedings, the respondent has expressed remorse in a most perfunctory way. The Tribunal acknowledges that his later conduct in pleading guilty (and his admissions in these proceedings) has spared the victims further trauma in having to give evidence. 

65The respondent's statement in these proceedings concludes with the statement: ""I can indicate to the Medical Tribunal of New South Wales, that I am truly contrite for my behaviour, the subject of the Amended Complaint"". Given the fact that the Complaint covers behaviour involving breach of Practice Conditions as well as the more serious matters, this statement of remorse is not convincing. More particularly, there is no recognition of the harm the respondent has caused to the many teenage boys involved in his offences. Absent such recognition, and consequently accountability and insight, the Tribunal is left with a serious question mark as to the respondent's current fitness to practise and to hold registration.

Orders

66The Tribunal finds to the requisite degree that, the respondent is guilty of professional misconduct. The Tribunal finds that the respondent has been convicted of the aforementioned criminal offences in New South Wales District Court and the circumstances of the offences render the respondent unfit in the public interest, to practise the medical profession. Finally, the Tribunal finds that the respondent is not a suitable person for registration as a medical practitioner.

67The position so far as the respondent's registration is a little unclear. His counsel has suggested that he has not renewed his registration and hence, it has elapsed. On the other hand, the certificate from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency which is in evidence before the Tribunal, suggests that the respondent's registration is suspended. In these circumstances, we consider it appropriate to make orders in the alternative. 

68The Tribunal accepts the submissions of the HCCC that it is in the public interest for the respondent's registration to be cancelled. Furthermore, we accept that the order suggested by the HCCC that the respondent not be permitted to reapply for re-registration for a period of four years from the date of the order, is appropriate. Although on one view, the period of four years it is somewhat arbitrary, given the unresolved issues of the respondent's insight and rehabilitation, given his age, the order appears appropriate. The respondent has made no submissions in opposition to these orders.

69The HCCC submits that it is appropriate to make an order pursuant to section 149C(5)(a) of the National Law that following cancellation of the practitioner's registration, he should be prohibited from providing health services for a period specified by the Tribunal. A pre-requisite for such an order is that the Tribunal must be satisfied ""the person poses a substantial risk to the health of members of the public"". The Tribunal notes that Flannery DCJ, in her Honour's sentencing remarks of 24 June 2011 accepted on the balance of probabilities that the offender had rehabilitated himself and was unlikely to re-offend. Her Honour's conclusion was based on the extensive references provided to the Court.

70Her Honour noted that it was difficult to reconcile the man those referees knew over the past 30 years with the man who committed these offences. Given the admitted offences occurred covertly and with no immediate complaint from the young victims for many, many years, we share her Honour's note of caution. This Tribunal does not proceed on the basis that the respondent may have continued his misconduct after 1982, because clearly there is no evidence for that proposition. On the other hand, the note of caution compels this Tribunal to reach a different conclusion concerning the respondent's rehabilitation. In short, we are left in a neutral position - i.e., we are simply unable to say on the state of the evidence that the respondent is rehabilitated or not. Bearing in mind the orders that we propose are protective in nature, the Tribunal is of the opinion that an order should be made pursuant to section 149C(5)(a). The respondent did not argue against the making of such an order.

71The Tribunal proposes to make the following orders:

i. The respondent's registration is cancelled; 

ii. alternatively, (if the respondent's registration has lapsed) had the respondent been registered, the Tribunal would have cancelled the registration on the bases of section 149C(1)(b), (c) and (d) of the National Law and would have disqualified him from being registered in the health profession for a period of four years - section 149C(4);

iii. the respondent is not permitted to reapply for review of his registration for a period of four years from the date of this order; and

iv. the practitioner is prohibited from providing health services generally until such time as he is reinstated to the Register of medical practitioners.

Costs

72The HCCC makes application that the respondent pay the costs of the proceedings. Counsel for the respondent contests that application, submitting that from an early point of time, the respondent, through his lawyers, indicated that he would not be defending the proceedings. The salient facts are that the matter was before the Court for a directions hearing on 31 January 2013 when the hearing date was set. On 25 March 2013, the respondent's bundle was served. It contained a statement of the respondent dated 28 February 2013, indicating that he had no further intention of practising medicine in the future, and therefore did not propose to renew his registration when it fell due. That was a position he had expressed in an earlier Statutory Declaration dated 3 June 2011, and the statement indicated he maintained that position.

73It is accepted by the respondent that there was no application to vacate the hearing date. Furthermore, the position appears to be that there was no contact between the solicitors for the HCCC and the solicitors for the respondent concerning the future progress of the hearing. The Tribunal was informed that there was contact between counsel in the week prior to the hearing but no acknowledgement by the respondent, that he would accept the orders sought by the HCCC.

74It is a little puzzling to the Tribunal why there were no communications between the parties as to the necessity for any formal hearing. Given that the respondent's statement indicated no future intention on his part to practise, and his advanced years, it is difficult to see how within those parameters, there would be any contested hearing as to the orders ultimately sought by the HCCC.

75Counsel for the HCCC referred to section 167 of the National Law, which she submitted, correctly in our view, gave a discretion to the Tribunal to conduct a hearing in circumstances where the complaint has been admitted. She submitted that whatever position the parties might take, it was a matter for the Tribunal to ultimately determine the necessity for a hearing. That is correct as far as it goes. However, it is difficult to see how the Tribunal could properly exercise its discretion if neither party brought to its attention, the fact that in effect, there would be no contest. 

76The Tribunal notes that the Civil Procedure Act 2005 does not apply to proceedings before this Tribunal. However, we consider that it is not inappropriate to apply by analogy the provisions of section 56 of that Act, which refers to the overriding purpose of those provisions being to facilitate the ""just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in dispute"". Similar notions appear to underpin Clause 11 of Schedule 5D of the National Law, which refers to the duty of the Tribunal to expeditiously determine Inquiries. We recognize that disciplinary proceedings are not civil proceedings and, accordingly, the practice and procedure to be adopted by the Tribunal must accord with the provisions of the National Law. The fundamental purpose of disciplinary proceedings, is to protect the public and preserve the integrity of the medical profession, in this particular case. We also accept, as counsel for the HCCC submitted, that there is a real public interest in the proceedings of the Medical Tribunal being publicised to inform the public, to deter members of the medical profession minded to act inappropriately and to vindicate the victims of any unprofessional conduct or professional misconduct perpetrated by any given medical practitioner. Indeed, counsel submitted that a number of the victims involved in the present proceedings, have remained in contact with the HCCC to monitor the progress of these proceedings.

77The Tribunal does not consider that even if an inquiry was dealt with in the absence of a public hearing, or alternatively a very curtailed public hearing, such as occurred here, that that precludes the publication of a judgment or determination by the Tribunal.

78Counsel made reference to three decisions, one of the Medical Tribunal and two of the Nursing and Midwifery Tribunal in which the issue of costs was considered, in circumstances where there was no contest or no significant contest. In each case, the relevant Tribunal considered it appropriate to award costs to the HCCC.

79The Tribunal accepts that the following principles apply: the Tribunal has an unfettered discretion (to be exercised judicially) to award costs to any party to an Inquiry - clause 13 of Schedule 5D of the National Law. It is not immediately clear from clause 13 that the ordinary rule in civil litigation applies, namely that a successful party has a reasonable expectation of being awarded costs against the unsuccessful party - see Oshlack v. Richmond City Council [1998] 193 CLR 72, [1998] HCA 11 at [134] cf NSW Medical Board v Dinakar [2009] NSWMT 8 at [42] - [44], where the Tribunal acknowledged its unfettered discretion in this regard, but nevertheless applied the civil law rule. The issue of costs in disciplinary proceedings is not identical to civil litigation - Ohn v Walton (1995) 36 NSWLR 77. The purpose of an order for costs is compensatory not punitive - Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534. The discretion should be exercised judicially, in accordance with the rules of reason and justice, and not in accordance with benevolence or sympathy.

80The authorities referred to by counsel are in our view, materially different to the present case. In HCCC v Greenwood [2011] NSWNMT 13, the practitioner did not appear and advised the Tribunal that she did not wish to contest the hearings nor practise as a nurse or midwife again. Despite those indications, the practitioner proffered some exculpatory considerations in relation to one of the complaints, did not admit a complaint, and made incomplete admissions to a further complaint. Against this background, the Tribunal awarded costs against practitioner noting at [59]:

The Tribunal acknowledges that it is not required to conduct an inquiry into a particular and may make protective orders in relation to it if a nurse or midwife who a complaint is about, admits that complaint in writing to the Tribunal. However, this case shows why the decision not hold an inquiry is discretionary.

81In HCCC v Gower [2011] NSWNMT 17, the practitioner was represented by counsel and admitted all the particulars of the complaint. There was however a contest about the appropriate protective orders to be made and evidence was given by the practitioner in this regard. In our opinion, this is a material difference to the present case.

82Finally in HCCC v Rahman [2013] NSWMT 6, the medical practitioner appeared in person, and whilst admitting the complaints, requested the Tribunal to allow him to practise, upon his release from prison. In those circumstances, the Tribunal awarded costs against him. Again, this is a significantly different situation to the present.

Counsel for the respondent stated that his client had served a jail term and wished to proceed with his life, without any contact with the provision of medical or health services. Given his age and circumstances, this is a reasonable and understandable approach. In our opinion, the respondent, through his lawyers has done all that can be reasonably expected of him to finalise the proceedings in an expeditious manner. The Tribunal accepts that the primary purpose of costs is to compensate the successful party. The Tribunal also accepts that the question of whether an award of costs works hardship on a party against whom it is made, is not a relevant matter in the decision to award or not to award costs. It is the conduct in the course of the proceedings and the result, which are in our view relevant.

83For these reasons, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that each party pay its own costs, from the time that the respondent's statement was served on the HCCC. In our opinion, the content of the statement should have precipitated communications between the parties and the potential shortening of this matter, perhaps even to the extent of rendering unnecessary a formal hearing. The Tribunal confirms the preliminary indication it gave that a costs order should be made on this basis.

Conclusion

84The Tribunal makes the following orders:

i. The respondent's registration is cancelled; 

ii. alternatively, (if the respondent's registration has lapsed) had the respondent been registered, the Tribunal would have cancelled the registration on the bases of section 149C(1)(b), (c) and (d) of the National Law and would have disqualified him from being registered in the health profession for a period of four years - section 149C(4);

iii. the respondent is not permitted to reapply for review of his registration for a period of four years from the date of this order; 

iv. the respondent is prohibited from providing health services generally until such time as he is reinstated to the Register of medical practitioners.

v. the respondent is to pay the costs incurred by the HCCC up until 25 March 2013; thereafter, each party is to pay its own costs.

2419547,FD v R [2013] NSWCCA 139,"Judgment
1SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Bellew J, and, subject to the following, with his Honour's reasons.

2In my opinion, the error in relation to the applicant's medical condition was of considerable significance and would ordinarily warrant some reduction in the sentence imposed. However, that error has to be balanced against two other errors, also significant, that favoured the applicant - the error (into which the sentencing judge was led) concerning the length of the applicable standard non-parole period, and the excessive allowance made in respect of the applicant's pleas of guilty and remorse. When those are factored in, the sentence was certainly not manifestly excessive.

3HARRISON J: I agree with Bellew J. I also agree with the additional remarks of Simpson J.

4BELLEW J: On 6 July 2012 the applicant pleaded guilty before Judge Charteris SC in the District Court to an indictment containing the following counts:

(1)between 1 October 2005 and 31 October 2007 at Bundarra in the State of New South Wales did assault SD and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency on SD, a child then under the age of 10 years, namely between 5 and 8 years (Crimes Act 1900 NSW s. 61M(2)) (""count 1"");

(2)between 1 January 2006 and 19 September 2009 at Mosman in the State of New South Wales did assault SD and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency on SD, a child then under the age of 10 years, namely between 5 and 8 years (Crimes Act 1900 NSW s. 61M(2)) (""count 2"");

(3)between 1 January 2006 and 19 September 2009 at Mosman in the State of New South Wales did assault SD and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency on SD, a child then under the age of 10 years, namely between 5 and 8 years (Crimes Act 1900 NSW s. 61M(2)) (""count 3"");

(4)between 1 January 2008 and 9 October 2009 at Bundarra in the State of New South Wales did assault SD and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency on SD, a child then under the age of 10 years, namely between 7 and 8 years (Crimes Act 1900 NSW s. 61M(2)) (""count 4"");

(5)between 9 October 2008 and 19 September 2009 at Mosman in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with SD, a child then under the age of 10 years, namely 8 years (Crimes Act 1900 NSW s. 66A) (""count 5"");

(6)between 1 January 2009 and 19 September 2009 at Mosman in the State of New South Wales did assault JD and at the time at such assault committed an act of indecency on JD, a child then under the age of 16 years, namely between 8 and 9 years (Crimes Act 1900 NSW s. 61M(2)) (""count 6"");

(7)between 1 January 2006 and 19 September 2009 at Bundarra in the State of New South Wales did assault JD and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency on JD, a child then under the age of 10 years namely between 5 and 8 years (Crimes Act 1900 NSW s. 61M(2)) (""count 7"");

(8)between 23 May 2009 and 19 September 2009 at Mosman in the State of New South Wales did assault JD and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency on JD a child then under the age of 16 years, namely 8 years (Crimes Act 1900 NSW s. 61M(2)) (""count 8"");

(9)between 1 March 2008 and 17 August 2009 at Mosman in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with JD a child then under the age of 10 years namely 8 years (Crimes Act 1900 NSW s. 66A) (""count 9"").


5The applicant also asked the sentencing judge to take into account four additional matters. The first three were contained in a Form 1 which was referable to Count 5 and alleged:

(1)an offence of aggravated indecent assault committed on SD at Bundarra between 9 October 2007 and 9 October 2008;

(2)an offence of aggravated indecent assault committed upon SD between 1 January 2008 and 9 October 2009 at Bundarra;

(3)an offence of aggravated indecent assault committed on SD between 23 May 2009 and 19 September 2009 at Mosman.


6There was a further Form 1 (referable to Count 9) which contained one additional matter which the applicant asked to be taken into account, namely a charge of aggravated indecent assault upon JD committed between 1 January 2006 and 1 September 2009 at Mosman. 

7On 20 July 2012 the sentencing judge imposed the following penalties:

(i)count 1 - imprisonment for 20 months;

(ii)count 2 - imprisonment for 15 months;

(iii)count 3 - imprisonment for 20 months;

(iv)count 4 - imprisonment for 16 months;

(v)count 5 - (taking into account the three matters on the Form 1) imprisonment for 3 years and 4 months;

(vi)count 6 - imprisonment for 21 months;

(vii)count 7 - imprisonment for 15 months;

(viii)count 8 - imprisonment for 2 years;

(ix)count 9 - (taking into account the further matter on the Form 1) imprisonment for 3 years and 2 months.

8In respect of each count his Honour indicated that he would fix the non-parole period at ""around 50 percent"" of the head sentence. Having considered questions of totality, his Honour imposed an aggregate sentence comprising a non-parole period of 4 years imprisonment to date from 6 July 2012 and to expire on 5 July 2016, with a balance of term of 4 years, to expire on 5 July 2020. 

9The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by his Honour, on the grounds more fully set out below.

THE APPLICABLE STANDARD NON-PAROLE PERIODS
10Before proceeding further, it is necessary to address an issue which was raised by the Crown at the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal and which was the subject of supplementary submissions.

11Each of counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 alleged an offence contrary to s. 61M(2) of the Crimes Act. In the course of his reasons, and in what appears to have been a reflection of the agreed position of the parties at the time, the sentencing judge observed that:


(i)the standard non-parole period applicable to each of counts 1, 2, 3, 6 and 8 was five (5) years imprisonment;


(ii)the standard non-parole period applicable to each of counts 4 and 7 was eight (8) years imprisonment.

12In supplementary submissions, with which (as I understand it) the applicant took no issue, the Crown set out the relevant legislative history commencing with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act""), and submitted that the standard non-parole period in respect of each of the offences under s. 61M(2) was eight (8) years. I agree with the Crown's submission and it is appropriate the I briefly state my reasons. 

13The Sentencing Act commenced on 1 February 2003. It was amended by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002 (""the 2002 Act"") which commenced on 1 February 2003. By s. 3 and sch. 1[4] of the 2002 Act, Division 1A (ss. 54A - 54D) was inserted into the Sentencing Act, which made provision for standard non-parole periods for certain offences which were specified in a Table. Item 9A in the Table nominated, as one of those offences, an offence against s. 61M(2), for which a standard non-parole period of five (5) years imprisonment was prescribed. 

14By virtue of the operation of s. 3 and sch. 3.2[9] of the 2002 Act, the standard non-parole provisions did not apply to offences committed prior to the commencement of the 2002 Act, i.e. 1 February 2003. In the present case, all of the offences under s. 61M(2) were committed after that date.

15On 1 January 2008, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2007 (""the 2007 Act"") commenced. Section 3 and sch. 1[10] of the 2007 Act amended the Sentencing Act by increasing the standard non-parole period applicable to an offence under s. 61M(2) from five (5) years imprisonment to eight (8) years imprisonment.

16In addition, s.3 and sch. 1[16] of the 2007 Act amended the Sentencing Act by inserting sch. 2, part 17, cl. 57 which provided that the amendments made to the Sentencing Act applied to the determination of a sentence for an offence whenever committed, unless, prior to the commencement of the amendments:

(i)the court had convicted the person being sentenced of the offence; or
(ii)a court had accepted a plea of guilty and the plea had not been withdrawn.

17In the present case, the applicant's pleas were first entered in the Local Court on 15 March 2012, and were entered before the sentencing judge on 6 July 2012, in each case well after the commencement of the 2007 Act. 

18Accordingly, and contrary to the position expressed by the sentencing judge, the standard non-parole period applicable to each of the offences under s. 61M(2) was one if eight (8) years imprisonment. To the extent that his Honour specified that the standard non-parole period applicable to the offending in each of counts 1, 2, 3, 6 and 8 was one of five (5) years imprisonment, he was in error, although I must stress that this arose in circumstances where both parties had put the incorrect position. 

19His Honour's error in this regard was not the subject of any submissions during the hearing of the appeal. The applicant did not rely upon it. The Crown raised it at the conclusion of oral argument, and dealt with it in supplementary written submissions. The error operated to the applicant's advantage.

20The matter having been raised, and an error having occurred, it is appropriate that it be pointed out. I have come to the conclusion, for the reasons more fully set out below, that other errors upon which the applicant did rely have been established, but that in the circumstances, no other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. Even if the applicant had relied upon his Honour's error as to the applicable standard non-parole period, it would not have affected the view that I have reached. 

THE FACTS
21 The applicant is the paternal grandfather of the two victims, who are twin girls. Counts 1 to 5 are referable to the first victim (SD) and counts 6 to 9 are referable to the second victim (JD).

22An agreed statement of facts was tendered before the sentencing judge. His Honour (commencing at ROS 5) found the facts to be as follows.

Count 1
23Between 1 October 2005 and 31 October 2007, SD and her family were visiting the applicant at his country property. There were a number of people staying there and there were insufficient beds for everyone to be able to sleep separately. The applicant insisted that SD, who was then aged between 5 and 8 years, sleep in his bed. On one evening when they were in bed together, the applicant rolled over and placed his hand down SD's underpants. He then rubbed her in the vicinity of her vagina for a period of approximately 5 minutes, something that SD described as ""funny as in weird"". The offender then removed his hand.

Count 2
24Between January and September 2009 the applicant was staying with SD and her family in Sydney. He was seated at the dinner table, with both victims seated on his lap, one on each knee. SD had her legs on either side of the applicant's legs underneath the table, and thus away from the view of the other adults who were sitting at the table. The applicant then proceeded to rub the vagina of SD outside her underwear for about 2 minutes, managing to conceal his behaviour from those other adults who were present. 

Count 3
25Between January 2006 and September 2009, when he was at SD's home in Sydney, the applicant was seated on a lounge next to the first victim, with both of them under a blanket. SD's older brother was sitting on the other end of the lounge. The applicant put his hands down SD's pants and rubbed her vagina. In doing so he concealed his actions from SD's elder brother. 

Count 4
26Between January 2008 and October 2009, when SD was aged between 7 and 8 years, her family were again staying at the applicant's country property. The applicant placed SD on his lap as they drove around the property, and allowed SD to steer the vehicle. Whilst she was on his lap the applicant placed his hands down her pants and rubbed her vagina. SD was not able to recall whether the applicant's hands were inside or outside her underpants at that time.

Count 5
27Between 9 October 2008 and 19 September 2009 the applicant again stayed with SD and her family in Sydney. At this time he slept with his youngest grand daughter who was the younger sister of SD and JD. One morning, SD got into the bed of the applicant to say good morning to him. The applicant took advantage of that situation by placing his hand inside SD's vagina and underwear, before rubbing her vagina for a period of between 5 and 10 minutes. SD told the police that the applicant had used one finger which she described him as having moved ""in a kind of swirl thingy movement"" in the middle of her vagina. The first victim also told police that this movement felt ""weird"" and that it hurt. 

Count 6
28Between 1 January 2009 and 19 September 2009, at a time when JD was between 8 and 9 years of age, the applicant stayed at her home in Sydney. The applicant and JD walked into the bedroom of JD's younger sister, who was playing on the floor, and who asked the applicant and JD to play with her. They started playing ""doctors and nurses"" and whilst JD lay on the bed, the applicant pretended to give her a needle. The applicant then pulled the covers over JD, unzipped her jeans, and placed his hand down her underpants. He then rubbed her vagina in a circular motion with his finger.

Count 7
29The offence in count 7 occurred between January 2006 and September 2009 when JD was between 5 and 8 years of age. Once again, JD was staying at the applicant's property and they were driving home after visiting one of the applicant's sons. The applicant allowed JD to sit on his lap and steer the car. When she was sitting on his lap, the applicant put his hand down JD's shorts and with his hand on the outside of her underwear he rubbed her vagina in a circular motion.

Count 8
30The applicant was visiting JD's home in Sydney at a time when the second victim was 8 years of age. JD went upstairs to use the bathroom and the applicant followed her. When she had finished urinating, the applicant picked her up and put her in a standing position on the bathroom vanity and kissed her on the vagina, telling her ""it's better"". SD was in the room next door and observed what had occurred. 

Count 9
31Between 1 March 2008 and 17 August 2009 at a time when JD was 8 years of age, the applicant was again at JD's home in Sydney. JD went to sleep in her parents' bed. The offender followed her and lifted up the covers, and rubbed her vagina inside her underwear in a circular motion. The applicant told JD that she had a ""little button thing"" and that if she touched it, it would tickle. 

The Form 1 matters
32There were, as previously indicated, a total of four further matters which the applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account. The first Form 1 contained three such matters, all of which related to SD. The second Form 1 contained one matter, relating to JD.
The First Form 1
33As to the first matter, SD was at the applicant's country property on a family holiday between October 2007 and October 2008. The applicant took her for a ride in a buggy around the farm and during the course of that ride he rubbed the outside of her vagina through her underpants.

34As to the second matter, SD was again at the applicant's country property between 1 January 2008 and 9 October 2009. The applicant drove SD to what was known as the ""old house"", which was an area secluded from other parts of the property. As they drove to that area, the applicant spoke to SD about sexual matters, and kissing. When they arrived at the old house, the applicant placed SD on a chair standing up. He then pulled her pants down and kissed her on the vagina.

35As to the third matter, the applicant was staying at SD's home in Sydney between 23 May 2009 and 19 September 2009. SD, who was about 8½ years of age at the time, went upstairs to put her shoes on. The applicant picked her up and placed her on the bathroom vanity. He then pulled her underwear down and kissed her on the vagina. SD told the applicant that his behaviour was ""gross"", and the applicant replied that it was ""beautiful"". 

The second Form 1
36The second Form 1 contained one matter which related to JD. Between 1 January 2006 and 19 September 2009 the applicant was again staying at JD'S premises in Sydney. She was playing on a computer in the lounge room, with the applicant sitting next to her. The applicant unbuttoned and unzipped JD's jeans, before placing his hands on her stomach. JD told the applicant that she had to go to the bathroom, and immediately left the area. JD told police that the actions of the applicant on this occasion felt ""really weird"".
 
The complaint
37The statement of facts before the sentencing judge recorded that both victims reported the applicant's conduct to their mother in September 2009. The father of the victims (the applicant's son) then confronted the applicant with the allegations. In response, the applicant said:

""Of course I felt them up but you're being unreasonable"".

THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE 
38Having regard to some of the grounds of appeal it is necessary to set out, in some detail, the medical evidence which was before his Honour on sentence. 

Dr Allnutt
39The applicant tendered a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt, Forensic Psychiatrist. Dr Allnutt had examined the applicant at the request of his solicitor on 14 May 2012 and provided a report dated 25 May 2012. At p. 2 of that report, under the heading ""Index incidents"", Dr Allnutt stated: 

""...he said that deep down he was aware that it was not the right thing to do at the time he offended but he still did it; he denied that during that time he was intoxicated. He did not believe that during the period he was suffering from any significant disturbances in his mood, or any unusual perceptual disturbances or significant anxiety symptoms"". 

40At p. 3, under the heading ""Current clinical issues"" Dr Allnutt said: 

""At the time that he saw me, when he considered what he had done, he was sorry that he had created a drama for his family; he said he now realised how serious the offending was ... He stated that he believed that what he had done was unacceptable, that it was unacceptable to touch a child or engage with a child sexually; he said previously, even though he used to read about others offending against children in the newspaper, for some reason, he never saw himself in that category"".

41Prior to his examination of the applicant, Dr Allnutt had been provided with a report of Dr Roberts, a Consultant Psychiatrist, dated 30 January 2012, together with a report of Dr McMahon, Clinical Psychologist, dated 7 May 2012. I have set out below the relevant parts of those two reports. At this stage, it is relevant to note that having been provided with that material, Dr Allnutt expressed the following opinion (commencing at p. 6 of his report):

""Notably, neuropsychological testing has revealed executive dysfunction with a diagnosis of mild neurocognitive disorder, consistent with abnormalities reportedly found on MRI scanning; thus your client manifests both evidence for structural damage and functional impairment likely contributed by his multiple underling (sic) chronic medical problems...His functioning, in my view, is mildly impaired secondary to depressive symptoms and neurocognitive deficits"".

42Dr Allnutt, went on to conclude (under the heading ""Synthesis"" at p. 8 of his report):

""It is possible that at the material time of the offending his neurocognitive deficits were probably present; the neurocognitive deficits have been described by the neuropsychologist as executive functioning deficits, predominantly in the area of abstract reasoning, slow visual memory processing and poor capacity to integrate feedback; executive functioning deals with decision making and social judgment; it is reasonable to consider that executive dysfunction contributed to some degree to an impairment in his social judgment; this consideration is given weight in the absence of a prior history of offending or evidence of inappropriate sexual behaviour, complaints or charges involving children prior to the period of offending and having regard to his age.""

Associate Professor Haber
43Two reports of Associate Professor Haber, a Consultant Physician, dated 30 May 2012 and 5 June 2012 were tendered before the sentencing judge. In the first of those reports, Associate Professor Haber observed that the applicant had been a diabetic for 33 years, was taking various forms of medication, had undergone bypass surgery and was a poorly controlled diabetic. In the second of those reports Associate Professor Haber expressed various views as to the likely effect of a period of incarceration upon the applicant's general health. 

Dr Vale
44Dr Vale, a Consultant Physician, examined the applicant in February 2012 and in May 2012, the applicant having originally been referred to him in 2009. In his two reports dated 16 February 2012 and 24 May 2012 (both of which were addressed to the applicant's General Practitioner) Dr Vale recorded complaints by the applicant of chest pain, right shoulder pain and short term memory loss, which Dr Vale considered may be the possible result of the applicant's hypertension. 

45Following his review of the applicant in May 2012, and having regard to the results of an echocardiogram which was performed on the applicant, Dr Vale recommended coronary angiography be undertaken. In the same report, Dr Vale set out the applicant's medication regime, which included insulin on account of the applicant's diabetes. 

Dr McMahon
46Dr McMahon, a Clinical Psychologist, provided a report dated 7 May 2012 which he prepared following a neuro psychological assessment of the applicant. He expressed the opinion (under the heading ""Diagnosis"" at p. 21) that the applicant met DSM-IV criteria for the following:

(i)Axis I - Mild Neurocognitive Disorder; paedophilia;

(ii)Axis II - Avoidant Traits;

(iii)Axis III - Diabetes; Heart condition;
(iv)Axis IV - legal issues;

(v)Axis V - GAF (current) = 55

47In terms of the first of those diagnoses, Dr McMahon said (at p. 21 - 22):

""(The applicant's) pattern of responding on psychometric testing revealed an impaired range score on the Twenty Questions Test and some weak scores in domains related to the area of executive functioning assessed by this test. There were observed intermittent difficulties with cognition including (the applicant) reporting being ""blank"" of mind and difficulties with word finding consistent with a probable vascular cause to this condition. However, his cognitive difficulties were not of the extent to qualify for consideration of a dementia diagnosis. This represents a significant mild abnormality of functioning and therefore Mild Neurocognitive Disorder was coded on Axis I"". 


48Dr McMahon provided a supplementary report regarding a particular aspect of the testing that he had administered but it is not necessary, for present purposes, to detail the content of that report. 

Dr Roberts
49Five reports of Dr Roberts were tendered before his Honour. Dr Roberts also gave oral evidence at the sentence proceedings. 

50The first of Dr Roberts' reports was dated 30 January 2012, and followed his initial examination of the applicant on 19 January 2012. Dr Roberts noted (at p. 4) that there was ""an assertion of cognitive impairment which was not clinically evident"", before further noting (at p. 6) that he had requested that the applicant undergo an MRI scan of the brain in order to ascertain whether there was any evidence of ""pathology to the brain that may predispose to inappropriate behaviour"". 

51On 16 February 2012, Dr Woodward performed the MRI scan which had been requested by Dr Roberts, and reported the following the findings:

""Impression: extensive bilateral changes of micro vascular ischemic disease with associated bilateral, small lacunar infarcts and further lacunar infarct in the left cerebral peduncle.""

52In an addendum to her report, Dr Woodward said:

""The degree of atrophy has been reviewed and this is moderate to moderately severe.""

53The results of the MRI scan were sent to Dr Roberts who, in his second report dated 29 February 2012, said at pp. 1 - 2 (in reference to the opinions of Dr Woodward):

""The addendum was added following a review of the films in which I considered that the degree of atrophy demonstrated was substantial and following consultation with Dr A Woodward of Hunter Imaging this impression was confirmed by her.

I note that the report indicates the presence of extensive bilateral changes of micro-vascular ischaemic disease with associated bilateral, small, lacunar infarcts and further lacunar infarct in the cerebral peduncle.

COMMENT. An infarct is an area of dead tissue arising as a result of ischaemic changes and denotes the death of brain cells in that area. 

The comment of atrophy i.e. shrinkage of the brain, which is described as moderate to moderately severe, is a circumstance in which there is a loss of brain substance due to vascular disease.

The presence of significant brain disease with the preservation of cognitive function is a reflection of the areas of the brain affected. On reasonable psychiatric grounds, the picture of cerebral degeneration in the context of a normal MMSE examination is reflective of a form of organic pathology that would account for (the applicant's) inappropriate behaviour and his lack of appreciation of that behaviour in terms of its seriousness.

In summary, (the applicant) presents as a man who has proven damage with loss of brain substance who behaved in an inappropriate manner as set out in the Court Attendance Notice documentation and in the Full Facts provided. 

His demonstration of poor impulse control in relation to this behaviour and his peculiar failure to be fully cognisant of the seriousness of his behaviour both in terms of his interaction with his grandchildren as well his current legal position is a reflection of the physical brain damage that is present.

I am of the view that the introduction of Androcur Therapy, a well recognised treatment for inappropriate sexual drives in males would substantially reduce (the applicant's) sexual drive and very substantially reduce any probability of re-offending.""

54Dr Roberts set out his recommendations in a report dated 29 February 2012 addressed to the applicant's General Practitioner, this being the third of his reports which was tendered before the sentencing judge.


55On 24 May 2012, having had the benefit of reading Dr McMahon's report of 7 May 2012, Dr Roberts provided a fourth report in which he said (at p. 1): 

""The diagnosis of (a mild neurocognitive disorder) reinforces my conclusions in relation to (the applicant).""

56Finally, on 6 June 2012, and having had the benefit of reading the two reports of Associate Professor Haber of 30 May 2012 and 5 June 2012, as well as the report of Dr Allnutt of 25 May 2012, Dr Roberts provided a fifth report in which he said (at pp. 1 - 2):

""In summary, the additional documentation confirms the my (sic) view that (the applicant) is a brain damaged individual whose judgment and his peculiar inability to understand the seriousness of his actions are a reflection to a substantial degree of the brain damage that has been shown to exist.

In regard to the use of Androcur I consider that this is the only treatment available that has a potential for success since by virtue of demonstrable brain damage (the applicant) would not be as amenable to psychological intervention as would be the case if such damage was not present.""

57Dr Roberts also gave oral evidence before the sentencing judge. He was asked in the course of his evidence in chief about whether or not the cognitive defect that he had diagnosed was likely to have been present in the applicant at the time of the relevant offending (at T 2 - 3):

""Q: ..... Is there anything in the medical history of this man that informs on that question as to whether the organic defects that you observed in the MRI and Dr Woodward has reported on, are likely to have been present during the time of the offending, which if I can remind you, I think the earliest date on the indictment is 1 October 2005?

A: Yes. One can draw an inference as to the length of time pathology has been present. If I just refer to the MRI the impression is of micro-vascular ischaemic disease. (The applicant) has small vessel disease which results in a ischaemia, which is a lack of supply of blood and nutrients to various areas of the body including the brain. There is no evidence of a significant massive acute episode, so he has no history of a major stroke. This type of pathology is a form of pathology that develops over a long period of time and if - in the letter to me from his General Practitioner, Dr Bruce Menzies, of 20/1/2012, Dr Menzies gives a summary of past history which I think is of assistance...In relation to the medical history as given by Dr Menzies, reference is made to 1980 with a diagnosis of diabetes. Diabetes causes complications due to vascular disease. In 2002 we've got a diagnosis of neuropathy with diabetes which would suggest that the diabetes was not particularly well controlled"".


58Having set out the applicant's history of insulin dependent diabetes, Dr Roberts gave the following further evidence in chief (at T 4):

""Q: Does that (history) inform on the question of the likelihood that is, on the balance of probabilities, that he was suffering from the micro vascular ischaemic disease associated with the atrophy of the brain as early as 2006?

A: Yes I think one could say that the suspicion of brain disease based on the history would be fairly high because he has the cluster of conditions including diabetes and hypertension and his control of - his attention to his own health is not good, which makes him more liable to suffer from the complications of the conditions that he's got that (sic) would be the case if he was pedantic with his diabetic control and other general health issues.""

59Having confirmed that he had seen the applicant only a matter of days prior to giving evidence, Dr Roberts gave the following further evidence in chief (commencing at T 5):

""Q: And on that occasion did he express any insight into the seriousness of the offending?

A: This has been an aspect of (the applicant's) presentation from his initial consultation, and was one of the reasons why I ordered the MRI. He does not appear to really understand the significance of the seriousness of the acts that he performed and I feel that this is a reflection of cognitive impairment. I just don't think he fully grasps the import of what he has done. That I feel is the result of his condition.

Q: Did he express to you nevertheless, this Wednesday when you saw him, any - did he make any statements at all about the significance of what he now understands was his conduct?

A: He indicated that he regretted the breakdown of his relationship with the family and he indicated that he was pleading guilty because he did not want to cause any more distress to his granddaughters and to that extent, I think he grasps that he has behaved inappropriately. But its tenuous and I think that's a reflection of his diseased state. It's - his mental - his cerebral function - he is not dissimilar to disinhibited behaviour which encompasses many areas of behaviour that you see in people in convalescent homes where forgetting the sexual side, but in terms of general behaviour, people from I suppose refined background and with good manors (sic) behave quite inappropriately in the context of their upbringing and standards. This is a reflection of brain damage and its something we're going to see a lot more of as life extends into high age.""


60Dr Roberts was then cross-examined (commencing at T 8) in relation to his evidence that at the time of his examination of the applicant a few days earlier, the applicant did not appear to really understand the significance of his offending. Having confirmed that he linked that lack of understanding to the applicant's brain damage, Dr Roberts said (at T 9): 

""I've been involved in these type of matters for many years and it is subjective but the degree of apparent inability to understand to the extent that it was present I felt was unusual and I think that's a reflection of his state of health and it is of concern. And it was one of the factors that initially at the time of his first consultation made me think that this is likely to be reflective of some what were used to call organic brain damage, now we call cognitive impairment, and that in fact was shown to be the case.""

61Dr Roberts was then cross-examined on that part of the report of Dr Allnutt of 25 May 2012 which recounted the history provided by the applicant to Dr Allnutt concerning his awareness that his offending was inappropriate. Having confirmed this was not a history which had been provided by the applicant to him, Dr Roberts turned to the opinion expressed by Dr Allnutt to the effect that it was reasonable to consider that the applicant's executive dysfunction contributed to an impairment in his social judgment (at T 9): 

""Q: But if it's in terms of 'I knew it was wrong at the time but still did it' - -

A: You see our executive function allows you - - it resides to a significant degree in the frontal lobe. If one has unacceptable impulses, and I'm here talking generally not specifically, an intact frontal lobe tells us he might want to do this but it's not appropriate. When one gets to a point where there is a certain degree of damage, one wants to do something, one knows possibly that it's inappropriate - I think one would know, but the capacity to exercise the control that would have been present in a healthy brain is no longer present.""

62Dr Roberts was then asked a number of questions by the sentencing judge. In answering those questions, Dr Roberts confirmed his opinion (at T 13) that the changes demonstrated on the MRI scan were the cause of a mild neuro-cognitive disorder which, in turn, affected the applicant's executive function. 

63Finally, and again in answer to a question from the sentencing judge, Dr Roberts made the following observation (at T 16 line 40) concerning the statement made by the applicant when confronted by his son (as set out in [37] above):

""It's very peculiar. If a grandfather sexually assaulted a granddaughter and the girl's father quite understandably questioned that behaviour, to say that behaviour was an overreaction, it just shows a lack of capacity to grasp, and I felt that type of thing is unusual"".
 
The sentences imposed
64Having recounted the agreed facts, his Honour noted (at ROS 11) that the applicant's offending involved criminal conduct perpetrated over a long period of time, and upon two young victims. He made specific reference (at ROS 12) to the fact that the applicant's offending involved a gross breach of trust, committed in circumstances in which the victims were entitled to expect a loving and protective relationship with their grandfather. 

65His Honour took into account the fact that the applicant had no prior criminal history and that he had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. He summarised in some detail (at ROS 13 - 15) the character evidence tendered on the applicant's behalf and was satisfied that the applicant had expressed genuine remorse. 

66His Honour then summarised the medical evidence which was before him, before making a number of findings on the basis of that evidence. Some of those findings are relevant to specific grounds of appeal and have been set out in full below. 

67His Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offending in counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 (being the counts under s. 61M(2)) as falling at the ""very lower limit of the middle range of offences that respond to that conduct (at ROS 27). He assessed the objective seriousness of the offending in counts 5 and 9 (being the counts under s. 66A) as falling ""very much in the lower end of the range of offences of this nature"" (at ROS 27 - 28). 

68His Honour regarded the age of the victims, and the fact that the offences involved a continuing course of conduct, as aggravating factors. Having referred to all of these matters, he proceeded to impose these sentences to which I previously referred. 

THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL
Ground 1 - The sentencing judge fell into error when he found that the applicant was ""running substantial properties"".

The evidence before his Honour
69The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings. There was, however, evidence of various histories provided by the applicant to medical practitioners which are relevant to this ground.

70Firstly, in his report of 25 May 2012 under the heading ""Demographics"" Dr Allnutt reported (at p. 2): 

""He presented as a 70 year old man who was divorced; at the time that I saw him he was taking a number of medications...he was not working, he was essentially retired"".

71Dr McMahon, under the heading ""Education and Employment History"" set out the applicant's employment as a youth. This included a period of time working in a family business, I infer until his mid thirties. Dr McMahon then reported (at p. 3):

""(The applicant) reported that he then bought a 1900 ac farm on the East side of Armidale and raised cattle and sheep for 7 years. He then sold this property and bought a second one of similar size on the West side of Armidale and raised cattle for approximately 7 years and then sold this block to University of New England as a research centre. He reported that he bought the 900 acre property ""Glenirie"" and then a further adjoining 8,000ac and another 1,100ac. He reported that he then bought a further 3,400 acres. He then bought the properties ""Windscombe"" and ""Binalong"" totalling another 5,500acres. He reported that he then bought the 4000acre property ""Waverly"" and an adjoining 2,000 acre property. He reported that he bought Primley at Armidale which was 2000 ac. He reported that his total pastoral holding was 26,000 acres.""

72Later in his report (at p. 5) Dr McMahon noted:

""(The applicant) reported that his eldest son's (sic) spoke to him only on business.""

73In his report of 30 January 2012, under the heading ""Current Occupation"", Dr Roberts reported (at p. 2):

""(The applicant) described himself as a grazier, that he did not do much but go from property to property.""

74However, Dr Roberts also gave oral evidence (at T 15) that it was his understanding that the applicant ""continues to engage, to some degree, in commercial ventures"". 

75The applicant's three siblings also provided a testimonial which was tendered before the sentencing judge. Having documented the early part of the applicant's working life, and having made specific reference to that part of his employment history which involved working in a family business, the document stated:

""After this (the applicant) moved to the Armidale district where he now holds substantial rural property interests and produces beef for the Australian market"". 

76The sentencing judge (commencing at T 14) canvassed with Dr Roberts the general issue of the extent to which the applicant's brain shrinkage had impacted on his ability to function in other areas of his life: 

""Q: How else has his judgment been adversely affected by the shrinkage of his brain you say? Its not just specific to thoughts of paedophilia is it? It would exhibit itself in other aspects of his life? 

A: It may or may not. It's my understanding that he continues to engage to some degree in commercial ventures. He has very poor judgment in terms of his capacity to co-operate with his positions. He has very poor judgment in terms of his ability to engage in his health. Not only has he not continued to take the Androcur, but he is also apparently failed to cooperate with people with his diabetes and his hypertension, with the result - again as a result of his compromised judgment, he's got a degree of renal failure, he's (sic) advanced his vascular disease, his general physical health prognosis is poor"".

His Honour's reasons
77As I have discussed more fully in my consideration of grounds 2 and 3, his Honour accepted the opinion of Dr Roberts that the applicant had shrinkage of the brain and that he was, as a consequence, suffering from some degree of cognitive deficit at the time of his offending. His Honour then said (at ROS 26):

""However, I am also conscious that the offender was well aware that what he was doing was inappropriate. The offender was functioning as an individual, he was running substantial properties, he was able to engage with his children"".


78I have made reference to his Honour's conclusion that the offender was ""well aware that what he was doing was inappropriate"" when considering grounds 2 and 3. The focus of the present ground is his Honour's finding that the applicant was ""running substantial properties"". 

The submissions of the parties
79Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that this Honour's finding was erroneous because there was no evidence:

(i)that the applicant was ""running"" substantial properties;

(ii)that whatever it was that the applicant did on the property upon which he lived, he did alone or unassisted; and 

(iii)upon which the sentencing judge could properly make an assessment of the extent to which the applicant's contribution to the management of any properties was indicative of his ability to properly appreciate the seriousness of his conduct.


80The Crown submitted that although the evidence did not go so far as to exclude the participation of others in the management of any property, the evidence remained consistent with the conclusion that the applicant retained an active interest in the control and operation of what had been described by his siblings as the ""substantial rural property interests"" that he acquired over the years.

81The Crown submitted that, in these circumstances, the evidence supported his Honour's finding. 

Consideration and conclusion
82His Honour's finding that the applicant was ""running substantial properties"" should not be considered in isolation. Importantly, before reaching that conclusion his Honour found that the applicant was, at the relevant time, functioning as an individual. In oral submissions, and when the matter was specifically raised, senior counsel for the applicant took no issue in respect of that finding, and expressly conceded that it reflected the fact.

83His Honour then made the impugned finding, namely that the applicant was ""running substantial properties"" before further concluding that the applicant was ""able to engage with his children"". Once again, the matter having been raised in oral argument, senior counsel for the applicant took no issue in respect of the latter finding, and again expressly conceded that it reflected the fact. 

84When the relevant passage of his Honour's reasons is viewed as a whole, it is apparent that having found that the applicant was ""functioning as an individual"" his Honour cited, by way of example of such functioning, the applicant's conduct in relation to his properties, and his engagement with his children. 

85There were, as I have set out, references in the report of Dr McMahon to the applicant discussing matters of ""business"" with his eldest son. On the evidence, the only business in which the applicant was engaged stemmed from the property holdings described in the evidence which, according to the testimonial provided by the applicant's siblings, that business produced beef cattle for the Australian market.

86Whilst the evidence before his Honour fell short of establishing the precise role which the applicant played in the conduct of any business. His Honour did not find that the applicant was, as it were, single handedly conducting the business of a pastoralist. Although his Honour's use of the word ""running"" to describe the applicant's role in the conduct of his properties was somewhat imprecise, it is apparent that his Honour was using that term in the sense of ""managing"" or ""directing"" such properties. 

87Viewed in this way, the evidence to which I have referred supported his Honour's conclusion. It is also important to bear in mind that the evidence of Dr Roberts (at [76]) above was to the effect that the applicant's brain damage may not necessarily have impacted upon aspects of his life outside his offending. 

88For these reasons, this ground is not made out.

Ground 2 - The sentencing judge fell into error when he found that the applicant ""must have had insight knowing that what he was doing was wrong and that if he were detected he would bring upon himself considerable trouble"".

Ground 3 - The sentencing judge fell into error when he found that the applicant ""was astute enough cognitively to conduct himself inappropriately with his grandchildren often when no one else was about and even if others were there, in such a manner that his behaviour was not detected"".

89These grounds raise a number of common issues and are conveniently dealt with together.
 
His Honour's reasons
90His Honour (at ROS 15) commenced with a summary of the medical evidence, parts of which I have set out above. Having done so, and in relation to the opinions of Dr Roberts, his Honour said (at ROS 22):

""However, generally I accept that the doctor's opinion is entitled to carry some weight. The doctor observed that paedophilia is present in a very small percentage of the population, very much less than one to two percent. The doctor particularly referred to the presentation of the offender to him, on the occasions he had to examine him. The doctor also referred to the offender's statement to his son, the father of the victims, when first challenged about his behaviour, namely the words 'of course I felt them up but you are being unreasonable'. The doctor said those words showed a lack of capacity to 'grasp the situation'. 

I accept the doctor's evidence about shrinkage of the brain. I accept his conclusions that the offender has had a deterioration of the brain and I accept that this has had an effect on his executive function and his social judgment"" (my emphasis in each case).
 
91Having summarised the evidence of Dr McMahon. His Honour concluded (at ROS 23):

""(Dr McMahon) diagnosed that the offender is suffering from a mild neuro-cognitive disorder and also diagnosed him as suffering from paedophilia. The offender showed weak scores in testing of his executive functioning. He had intermittent difficulties with cognition but not sufficient to qualify for a diagnosis of dementia. The offender had a significant, but mild, abnormality of functioning. I accept Dr McMahon's opinion"" (my emphasis).
 
92Finally, his Honour made reference to the evidence of Dr Allnutt. He observed (at ROS 24) that Dr Allnutt had reported that the neuro-psychological testing of the applicant exhibited executive dysfunction and that a diagnosis of mild neuro-cognitive disorder was made. He also observed that such diagnosis was consistent with the abnormalities which had been reported on the MRI scan of the applicant's brain. His Honour then concluded (at ROS 25):

""(Dr Allnutt) considered it was reasonable to consider that the loss of executive function of the offender had contributed to some degree to an impairment in his social judgment. That conclusion was given weight in the absence of a prior history of offending and having regard to his advanced age. The doctor observed that offenders who commit incest, as a group, have the lowest rate of sexual recidivism compared to other groups of sexual offenders. The offender falls into a group of a low risk of future sexual misbehaviour. The doctor recommended psychological sexual counselling.

""I accept the conclusions of Dr Allnutt and I consider they are supported to an extent by the opinions of Dr Roberts. I also accept the psychological conclusions of Dr McMahon"" (my emphasis in each case).

93Bearing in mind his Honour's general acceptance of the opinions of Drs. Roberts, McMahon and Allnutt, his Honour then said (at ROS 26):

""It is urged upon me that the offender's behaviour was a result of his cognitive deficit. I cannot make that conclusion but I do accept that the offender was suffering some degree of cognitive deficit when he commenced his behaviour. I accept that the behaviour was abhorrent. I accept that it is likely, although not revealed by the offender, that he has had feelings of a paedophilic nature most of his life. He was able, with a normal brain to exercise appropriate judgment so as not to act upon those feelings. I accept that it is no coincidence that the degeneration of the brain, and his diminished cognitive capacity, to declare themselves around the time he commenced to offend. However, I am also conscious that the offender was well aware that what he was doing was inappropriate. (my emphasis).

94Having concluded (at ROS 26) that the applicant was ""well aware that what he was doing was inappropriate"" his Honour made the finding which is the subject of ground 2 (at ROS 26): 

""He must have had insight knowing that what he was doing was wrong and that if he were detected he would bring upon himself considerable trouble.""

95This was immediately followed by his Honour making the finding which is the subject of ground 3 (at ROS 26): 

""He was astute enough cognitively to conduct himself inappropriately with his grandchildren, often when no one else was about and, even if others were there, in such a manner that his behaviour was not detected"".

96His Honour then said (at ROS 27):

""I cannot explain his behaviour entirely by the existence of the cognitive deficit and shrinkage of his brain. This offender, I conclude, did have the capacity and the experience of life not to have acted upon his impulses even if his control was diminished. He chose to engage in this conduct and conceal his behaviour. I accept Dr Roberts' opinion that he does not have sufficient insight into the enormity of what he has done and that is probably due to his cognitive deficit"" (my emphasis in each case).

97Finally, his Honour said (at ROS 28):

""I take into account the shrinkage of his brain and the cognitive deficits but I also take into account, as I have said, that he knew that what he was doing was wrong"" (my emphasis).

The submissions of the parties
98The fundamental submission of the applicant was that the findings made by his Honour which are the subject of grounds 2 and 3 were generally against the weight of the evidence and, more specifically, at odds with his Honour's acceptance of the applicant's medical case, and the opinion of Dr Roberts in particular.

99The Crown relied, in particular, upon that part of the applicant's history reported by Dr Allnutt, namely that the applicant was aware that his offending was not the right thing to do, but that he had nevertheless persisted in doing it. This, the Crown submitted, provided support for the finding of the sentencing judge that the applicant must have had insight into the wrongfulness of his behaviour, as well as an insight into the consequences which would eventuate if that behaviour were discovered.

100In this regard, senior counsel for the applicant submitted that properly construed, the applicant's history to Dr Allnutt did not amount to an admission on the part of the applicant that he engaged in the offending with moral culpability. Rather, it was submitted, the history was evidence of impaired functioning on the part of the applicant. 

101Senior counsel for the applicant also relied upon the fact that the history was provided to Dr Allnutt some considerable time after the offending. This, senior counsel submitted, rendered it necessary to exercise considerable caution in determining what weight should be attached to it. 

Consideration and conclusion
102As I have previously outlined, his Honour generally accepted the medical opinions which were relied upon in the applicant's case. These included, importantly, accepting the opinions of Dr Roberts concerning the shrinkage and deterioration of the applicant's brain (at ROS 22). 

103The opinions of Dr Roberts were, of course, not limited to the fact that the applicant had brain damage. They extended to the effects of such brain damage. His Honour expressly accepted (at ROS 22) that these included effects upon the applicant's executive function and social judgment. However in both his written reports and his oral evidence, Dr Roberts went substantially further, and articulated those effects in some detail. In particular, it was Dr Roberts' opinion that: 


(i)the applicant had moderate, to moderately severe, shrinkage of the brain which was ""significant"" (at [53] - [54] above);
(ii)the applicant's brain degeneration was reflective of a form of organic pathology which accounted for the applicant's inappropriate behaviour, his lack of appreciation of that behaviour, and his lack of appreciation of its seriousness (at [53] above);
(iii)the applicant was a brain damaged individual whose judgment, and inability to understand the seriousness of his actions, were a reflection of the brain damage which existed (at [56] above);
(iv)there was an inference available that the brain damage, and its effects, were present at the time of the offending (at [57] - [58] above);
(v)the applicant did not appear to understand the seriousness of his offending which was a reflection of the cognitive impairment brought about by his brain damage (at [59] above);
(vi)the applicant did not, as a result of his condition, fully grasp the import of what he had done, a circumstance which was particularly reflected in his response when confronted by his son (at [59] and [63] above);
(vii) the applicant's degree of apparent inability to understand the extent of his offending was a reflection of his state of health (at [60] above); and
(viii)there was, as a consequence of his brain damage, an impairment of the applicant's executive function which resulted in the applicant being impaired in terms of his capacity to control his impulses (at [61]) above.

104Although his Honour summarised the medical evidence within which these specific opinions were expressed, he did not further consider them in any detail. In particular, he did not engage in any analysis of those part(s) of such opinions he accepted, and those which he did not. In these circumstances, and having regard to his express acceptance (at ROS 22) of the opinions of Dr Roberts, his Honour must be taken to have accepted those specific aspects of Dr Roberts' opinions set out in [103] above. In other words, his Honour must be taken to have accepted Dr Roberts' opinions not only in relation to the fact of the applicant's brain damage, but also in relation to the particular effects that flowed from that brain damage. 

105Accepting this to be the case, his Honour's findings that the applicant: 


(a)""must have had insight knowing that what he was doing was wrong and that if he were detected he would bring upon himself considerable trouble"" (ground 2); and
(b)was astute enough cognitively to conduct himself inappropriately with his grandchildren ..."" (ground 3)
were at odds with the opinions of Dr Roberts that the applicant:



(i)lacked an appreciation of his behaviour, and of its seriousness;
(ii)did not fully grasp the import of what he had done; and
(iii)was not able to understand the extent of his offending;

106There are, in my view, other examples of conclusions reached by his Honour which were at odds with his acceptance of the medical evidence. For example, his Honour found (at ROS 27) that the applicant:


(a)could not explain the applicant's behaviour ""entirely by the existence of the cognitive deficit and shrinkage of his brain"";
(b)""did have the capacity ..... not to have acted on his impulses even if his control was diminished""; and 
(c)""chose to engage in this conduct and conceal his behaviour"".

107In my view, those findings reflect error, for two reasons.

108Firstly, bearing in mind his Honour's acceptance of the opinions of Dr Roberts, there is some tension between his Honour's acceptance of the applicant's cognitive deficit and its resultant effects on the one hand, and his conclusion that the applicant ""chose"" to engage in the conduct which was the subject of the offending on the other. Whilst the applicant may have chosen to engage in the behaviour which was the subject of the offending in the sense of exercising his free will to do so, an acceptance of the existence of his cognitive deficit and its consequences necessarily led to the conclusion that although he made such a choice, he lacked an appreciation of the seriousness and extent of his behaviour, and did not fully grasp the import of it. According to Dr Roberts, the applicant's inability to fully grasp the import of his behaviour was reflected in the statement he made to his son when confronted with the allegation of his behaviour. His Honour made a specific reference (at ROS 22) to that statement before immediately proceeding to express his acceptance of Dr Roberts' opinions. 

109Secondly, his Honour's conclusion that the applicant had the capacity not to act on his impulses is diametrically opposed to the opinion of Dr Roberts (expressed in his oral evidence before the sentencing judge set out at [60] - [61] above) that the applicant's brain was such that he did not have that capacity. 

110Finally, and again bearing in mind his Honour's acceptance of the opinions of Dr Roberts, his conclusions (at ROS 26) that the applicant ""was aware that what he was doing was inappropriate"" and (at ROS 28) that the applicant ""knew what he was doing was wrong"" are at odds with Dr Roberts' opinions that the applicant:


(i)lacked an appreciation of his behaviour;
(ii)lacked an appreciation of the seriousness of that behaviour; and 
(iii)was unable to understand its extent.

111For these reasons, grounds 2 and 3 are made out. 

112I have further considered below, having regard to s. 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, whether any other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. 

Ground 4 - The sentencing judge fell into error when he found that the applicant ""seemed to have contrived circumstances where he could be alone with each girl"".

His Honour's reasons
113His Honour (at ROS 26), having referred to the circumstances of count 2 which was the offending committed in the presence of other adults at a dinner table, said:

""I also note that he had seemed to have contrived circumstances where he could be alone with each girl: each girl he inappropriately touched when he allowed each of them to drive a vehicle on his property.""

114The references to the offending when the applicant allowed each victim to drive a vehicle on his property was a reference to the offending in count 4 (in respect of SD) and count 7 (in respect of JD).

The submissions of the parties
115Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that in circumstances where the offending was set out in the agreed facts, there was simply no evidence of any specific circumstance(s) which would support the conclusion that the applicant had contrived any situation where he could be alone with his grandchildren for the purposes of interfering with them. 

116The Crown submitted that his Honour's observation that the applicant had contrived circumstances was not to be taken in isolation. The Crown submitted that his Honour's reference to ""circumstances where (the applicant) could be alone with each girl"" was, when read in combination with the sentence that followed, limited to the offending in counts 4 and 7, and items 1 and 2 on the first Form 1, being the offending which occurred when the applicant was present with each of the victims in his vehicle. 

117The Crown relied upon the fact that apart from that referable to counts 2, 3 and 6, the applicant's offending occurred when he was alone with the respective victims. This, it was submitted, was a factor which supported his Honour's conclusion.

Consideration and conclusion
118On a fair reading of the impugned passage of his Honour's judgment, it is apparent that the circumstances to which he was referring were limited to those to which he expressly referred, namely those instances in which the applicant's offending occurred whilst each of the victims was seated on his lap in his motor vehicle. These instances of offending, as well as others, occurred in circumstances where the applicant was alone with the respective victims. Equally however, there were other instances in which the applicant offended in the presence of others. The offending in count 2, which was committed at a dinner table in the presence of other adults, serves as the most obvious example.

119In determining the circumstances of the offending in counts 4 and 7, his Honour was essentially limited to the contents of the agreed statement of facts which I have set out. In my view, those facts fell short of supporting a conclusion that the applicant had contrived the circumstances to ensure that he was alone with the respective victims. Whilst there may have been, in view of the applicant's overall offending, some suspicion in that regard, it was necessary for his Honour to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before making such a finding. In my view, the evidence was not sufficient to reach that point. 

120It follows that in my view, ground 4 has not been made out. 

Ground 5 - Each of the findings above was against the evidence and inconsistent with the findings made concerning the diminished cognitive capacity of the applicant.
121Having upheld grounds 2, 3 and 4, it follows that I would also uphold ground 5.

Ground 6 - The sentencing judge fell into error when he categorised each of the indecent assault offences as 'at the very lower limit of the middle range of offences that respond to that conduct' when the offences were in lowest range of offences of the relevant type.

His Honour's reasons
122Having made reference to various aspects of the applicant's offending, his Honour (at ROS 27) concluded that the offending in each of counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 was at the ""very lower limit of the middle range of offences that respond to that conduct"". 

The submissions of the parties
123Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that the relevant offending fell at the lowest level of the range, as opposed to falling at the lowest point of the middle of the range (as his Honour found). In support of that proposition, senior counsel submitted that: 

(i)none of the offences involved violence or the threat of violence, either during their commission or afterwards, as a measure of attempted concealment of the offence;

(ii)there was no physical hurt inflicted;

(iii)each of the offences was of very short duration; and

(iv)there was no humiliation of either victim.

124Senior counsel further relied on the fact his Honour failed to distinguish, within those various counts, between those in which the applicant touched the victims on the outside of their clothes, and those in which he had touched their bare skin, either by placing his hands inside their underwear or kissing them. 

125The Crown pointed out that each of the offending in counts 1, 3, 6, 7 and 8 involved touching the external genitalia of the respective victims. The Crown also relied upon the age of each victim. In particular, in respect of counts 6 and 8, the Crown pointed to the fact that the victim in each case (JD) was aged between 8 and 9 years, in circumstances where the relevant statutory provision applied to a child under 16 years. As an indicator of the objective seriousness of the offending, the Crown relied on the fact that the age of the victim was substantially less than the age prescribed by the statute. 

126Finally, the Crown relied upon the fact that the offending was repeated, and involved an obvious breach of trust. 

127In all of these circumstances, the Crown submitted that there was no error in the sentencing judge's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. 

Consideration and conclusion
128The matters upon which senior counsel for the applicant relied in support of this ground are certainly relevant to any assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. Obviously however, they were not the only relevant considerations. 

129One of the principal matters relied upon by the Crown was that the offending exhibited a breach of trust on the part of the applicant. That breach of trust was properly described by his Honour (at ROS 28) as ""despicable"". His Honour also properly took into account that the offending was aggravated by the age of the victims, that there was more than one victim, and that the applicant engaged in a continuing course of conduct.

130In my view, a consideration of all of the relevant factors supported his Honour's conclusion as to the objective seriousness of the offending. 

131For these reasons this ground is not made out.

IS ANY OTHER SENTENCE WARRANTED IN LAW?
132Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is in the following terms:

""(3) On an appeal under section 5 (1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal. ""

133The opinion to which the section refers is an essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power for which the section provides. Unless such an opinion is reached, then that essential pre-condition is not satisfied (see R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704). 

134In Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 Spigelman CJ considered the meaning of the words ""warranted in law"" as they appear in the section and said:

""[18] In these circumstances the phrase 'warranted in law"" should be understood as a reference to the entire body of legal rules that inform the exercise of a sentencing discretion, i.e. both statutory requirements and sentencing principles developed at common law.

[19] The import of paragraph [79] of Simpson was to ensure that submissions in the Court of Criminal Appeal did not proceed as if the identification of error created an entitlement on the part of the applicant to a new sentence, for example, by merely adjusting the sentence actually passed to allow for the error identified. That would be to proceed on the assumption that the sentencing judge was presumptively correct, when the court has determined that the exercise of the discretion had miscarried. Section 6(3) is directed to ensuring that the Court of Criminal Appeal does not proceed in that manner, but re-exercises the sentencing discretion taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles with a view to formulating the positive opinion for which the subsection provides.""

The submissions of the parties
135Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentences imposed failed to properly recognise the opinions of Dr Roberts. He submitted that his Honour's acceptance of those opinions should necessarily have led to the conclusion that the applicant's moral culpability was reduced. He submitted that such a reduction in moral culpability was not reflected in the sentences which were ultimately imposed. 

136Senior counsel further submitted that the sentencing judge failed to take into account that there was a reduced need for specific deterrence in the case of the applicant, on account of his diagnosed brain damage and its resultant effects.

137Accordingly, it was submitted that in the event that this Court concluded that any of the grounds of appeal were made out, the Court should conclude that some lesser sentence was warranted, and should proceed to re-sentence the applicant. In the event that this position was reached, an updated report of Associate Professor Haber was tendered. 


138The Crown submitted that even if error were found, this Court should not interfere. In support of this submission the Crown relied, in part, upon those matters which were relied upon in respect of ground 6.


Consideration and conclusion
139The fact that an offender was, or is, suffering from some mental disorder or disability, either at the time of the commission of the offence or at the time of the sentencing, is a factor which may be taken into account (see R v Anderson [1981] VR 155; (1980) 2 A Crim R 379). In particular, the mental condition of an offender is capable of reducing that offender's moral culpability and may lead to a conclusion that matters such as general deterrence, retribution and denunciation have less weight (see Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [53]). 

140In R v Israil (2002) NSWCCA 255 Spigelman CJ said (at [23]):

""To the extent that mental illness explains the offence - as her Honour found to be the position in the present case - then an offender's inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law. As Wood CJ at CL put it in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, at [254]: 

""... the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing.""

141I interpolate that in the present case, Dr Roberts was clearly of the view that the applicant's brain damage went some way to explaining his offending. 

142Spigelman CJ in Israil (supra) further observed (at [25]) that mental illness may also lead to the conclusion in a particular case that the element of personal deterrence is also entitled to less weight in the sentencing exercise than might otherwise be warranted. Similarly, in R v Lauritsen [2000] WASCA 203; (2000) 114 A Crim R 333, Malcolm CJ said (at [48]):

""...mental illness is not only relevant to assessing culpability, in which case it must be shown to have contributed to the offence, but it is also relevant to assessing the level of danger the offender presents and the appropriate way in which the offender is to be rehabilitated. The mental illness should be taken into account in sentencing whether or not it played a part in the commission of the offence, but not with the consequence of the imposition of a sentence which exceeds the seriousness of the offence.""

143The sentencing judge did not, at any stage, specifically address the impact of the applicant's mental illness upon his moral culpability, nor did he address its impact upon the need for general deterrence. In my view, these were factors which the applicant was entitled to have taken into account in his favour. 

144However, the fact that the applicant's brain damage may have operated to lessen his moral culpability, and may have rendered general deterrence of less significance, does not lead to the conclusion that some lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed. 

145There was no error in his Honour's assessment of the objective gravity of the applicant's offending. His Honour applied a discount of 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea of guilty and accepted further (at ROS 29) that the applicant genuinely regretted his conduct. He found that such regret was evidenced, in particular, by the applicant's insistence that the victims were not to be subjected to the stress that would inevitably have eventuated had the matter proceeded to trial. 


146Having allowed a discount of 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea, his Honour (at ROS 29) increased that discount to one of 35 per cent, to ""take into account the discounts for the plea of guilty and his genuine contrition"". In allowing a separate discount of ten per cent to reflect the applicant's contrition his Honour erred (see R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 185 A Crim R 1 at [32] per Howie J, McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing). However, this was an error which significantly favoured the applicant. 

147His Honour took into account (at ROS 12 - 13) the fact that the applicant was a person of prior good character. He also had regard (at ROS 29 - 30) to the fact that as a result of his various physical and mental health disabilities, the impact, upon the applicant, of a term of imprisonment, particularly in circumstances where the prognosis was that there would be continued deterioration of his brain, would be significant. He also found special circumstances (at ROS 30) based upon the fact of the applicant's age, combined with the fact that he had not previously been in custody. 

148It follows that but for the issue of the impact of the applicant's brain damage on the questions of moral culpability and general deterrence, his Honour had full regard to every aspect of the applicant's subjective case. He assessed that case in a way which was most favourable to the applicant. 

149Moreover, and when viewed objectively, the inherently serious nature of the applicant's offending was aggravated by a number of matters. The offending involved what was properly described by his Honour as a ""despicable"" and ""gross"" breach of trust, it occurred over an extended period of time, and it was committed upon two victims of tender age. 

150Even when full regard is paid to the applicant's diagnosed brain damage and its effects, including its effect upon the applicant's level of moral culpability and the need for general deterrence, it remains the case that the nature of his repeated offending towards the two victims was most serious. He took advantage of each of them in a way which represented the antithesis of the close and loving relationship that each was entitled to expect from their grandfather. 

151In these circumstances, I am not of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law or should have been passed.

		21 June 2013",2013-06-13 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2419632,R v Weazel [2013] NSWSC 856,"Judgment


	
	The accused, Cyril James Weazel, is charged with one count of murder allegedly occurring on 27 July 2011; the victim being his then de facto partner, Nancy Dynevor. In the alternative he is charged with causing her grievous bodily harm with intention to cause grievous bodily harm. The accused was brought up for arraignment in this Court in accordance with the usual practice, but Mr Austin of counsel for the accused raised as a preliminary question the fitness of the accused to be tried. Accordingly, the matter was listed for a hearing to determine that question.
	
	
	The facts relied on by the Crown are set out in the Crown case statement which has been filed, and to which no detailed reference need be made. It is fair to say I think that the prosecution case comprises a history of violence to a greater or lesser extent allegedly inflicted by the accused on the victim over some hours whilst they went from place to place in or near Mount Druitt, ultimately returning to their shared boarding house room at Redfern. The case is essentially a circumstantial one relying on the alleged violence over this period, including assaults which occurred after their return to the Redfern premises, together with alleged threats. The Crown case refers to a conversation between the accused and ambulance officers who were called to the site after the victim died in which he claimed she received her injuries whilst fighting girls at Mount Druitt. In an interview with police he stated, on the other hand that after their return home to Redfern that night the deceased kept “whacking her head” against the wall for possibly 5 to 10 minutes. There is no doubt that the accused and, for that matter, the deceased were very heavily intoxicated.
	
	
	Although a pulse was restored by the ambulance officers, the deceased sustained irreversible brain damage as a result of the period without adequate delivery of blood and oxygen to her brain. The cause of death was cardiac arrest because of multiple blunt force injuries and acute ethanol, or alcohol, intoxication.
	
	
	The picture of physical injuries, however, is complex, including the likelihood that fractures to her ribs may have been caused by vigorous and prolonged chest compressions in an attempt at resuscitation. However, given the large number of blunt force injuries, which I do not need to describe, there is powerful objective evidence that the major contributing cause of death were blows inflicted by some person, rather than self-inflicted injuries. On the Crown case, the only candidate for that conduct is the accused.
	
	
	I have set out these matters in a little detail to indicate that the trial, should it occur, will not be simple or straightforward. Witnesses as to the preceding events, of which there are a number, will need to be cross-examined; and for that to occur the accused must be in a position to instruct his counsel, as well as to his own actions, intents and understanding.
	
	
	I have mentioned that the accused was heavily intoxicated at the relevant time, which adds a complicating feature to his ability to mount a defence, if he has one, to the Crown case. Mere amnesia or confusion about events relevant to a trial will not usually render an accused unfit for trial, even if that confusion or amnesia derives from some brain damage or psychiatric condition. It will usually be more significant to assess the understanding of the accused of the trial process itself: the role of his or her counsel; the role of prosecuting counsel and those of the judge and jury; and, more generally, the nature of the trial process designed to establish whether he or she be guilty or otherwise.
	
	
	When a question of fitness to stand trial is raised the procedure is governed by ss 8 and 10 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 which relevantly state:
	


8   Procedure where question of unfitness raised before arraignment

(1)  If the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is raised at any time before the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, the Court must determine whether an inquiry should be conducted before the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offence.

(2)  The Court may, at any time before the inquiry is commenced, determine that there is no longer any need for such an inquiry to be conducted.

10   Procedure on raising question of unfitness

(1)  If, in respect of an offence:

(a)  the Court determines that an inquiry should be conducted and does not subsequently determine, before the inquiry is commenced, that there is no longer any need for such an inquiry to be conducted, or

(b)  the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for the offence is raised after the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence,

the Court must (except as provided by this section), as soon as practicable after the determination is made or the question is raised, as the case may be, conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether the person is unfit to be tried for the offence.

(2)  The Court must not conduct an inquiry into the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence unless it appears to the Court that the question has been raised in good faith.

(3)  Before conducting an inquiry, the Court may do any one or more of the following:

(a)  adjourn the proceedings,

(b)  grant the accused person bail in accordance with the Bail Act 1978,

(c)  remand the accused person in custody for a period not exceeding 28 days,

(d)  request the accused person to undergo a psychiatric examination or other examination,

(e)  request that a psychiatric report or other report relating to the accused person be obtained,

(f)  discharge any jury constituted for the purpose of those proceedings,

(g)  make any other order that the Court considers appropriate.

(4)  If, in respect of a person charged with an offence, the Court is of the opinion that it is inappropriate, having regard to the trivial nature of the charge or offence, the nature of the person’s disability or any other matter which the Court thinks proper to consider, to inflict any punishment, the Court may determine not to conduct an inquiry and may dismiss the charge and order that the person be released.


	
	Section 11 of the Act provides that the question of a person’s unfitness to be tried for an offence is to be determined by the judge alone and, s 12, that this is not to be conducted in an adversarial manner and that the onus of proof does not rest upon any particular party. Indeed, that is the way in which the present inquiry has been conducted.
	
	
	The accused has been examined by two highly experienced forensic psychiatrists, a psychologist and a neuropsychologist, the latter having conducted, amongst other inquiries, appropriate psychometric testing. Their reports have been tendered by agreement between the parties. The Crown has submitted that these reports demonstrate that the accused is unfit to be tried, a submission which Mr Austin for the accused also makes. However, it is for the Court to determine whether the accused is unfit and it cannot be a matter decided by consent.
	
	
	The test for examining unfitness to be tried, as has frequently been stated, emerges from the judgment of Smith J in R v Presser [1958] VR 45. Whilst the considerations identified by his Honour have often been referred to with approval and, with respect, constitute a useful guide, they are not to be regarded as legislative provisions. As his Honour himself said at p. 48, the test needs to be applied “in a reasonable and commonsense fashion”, and went on to say that, although certain minimum standards need to be satisfied before an accused can be tried without unfairness or injustice, it is not necessary that the accused “not have the mental capacity to make an able defence” (emphasis added). Nor is it necessary that the accused have sufficient capacity to act wisely or in his own best interests. The minimum requirements include the ability to understand the crime with which he is charged and, of course, its elements, the ability to plead to the charge and exercise the right of challenge, to understand generally the nature of proceedings, namely that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with, able to follow the course of proceedings in a general sense, understand the substantial effect of evidence that may be called, give necessary instructions to his counsel, including his version of the facts, and, if necessary, being able to tell the Court about those facts. He must also understand the defences that might be available to him.
	
	
	As I have mentioned, to take an extreme case, an amnesic accused will, ex hypothesi, not be able to recall the relevant events. Indeed, the accused here suffers to a greater or lesser extent, as the doctors found on examination, from considerable confusion and memory loss in relation to them, although his assertions to the ambulance officers and the police might suggest that he, at least at that time, recalled more than he now does.
	
	
	In this case, it seems to me that the crucial questions are the extent to which the accused is able to understand and participate in the trial, especially as to the functions of the various persons involved in its conduct. The doctors all agree that having, regard to the accused’s history, presentation and testing he suffers from significant cognitive impairment (borderline impaired range), most likely in the form of alcohol related brain damage to the frontal lobe.
	
	
	Set out below are more or less the quotations in the Crown’s submissions which seem to me to fairly set out the reports, as I read them.
	


“Expert Opinions

In determining his unfitness for trial the accused was examined by Doctor Richard FURST, Forensic Psychiatrist, Doctor llana HEPNER, Clinical Neuropsychologist and Doctor Peter ASHKAR, Consultant Forensic Psychologist on behalf of the defence and by Doctor Yvonne SKINNER, Psychiatrist, on behalf of the Crown.

General Mental State Examination

Based on the accused’s history, presentation and the testing conducted all experts seem to agree that he suffers from significant cognitive impairment (borderline impaired range) most likely in the form of alcohol-related brain damage to the frontal lobe.

Assessment of The Accused’s Fitness

Dr Ashkar

Dr Ashkar attempted to assess the offender’s ability to understand the criminal process and to assist in his defence using a semi-structured interview based on the Presser criteria and reported as follows (par. 10 Report 17 September 2012):

“Cyril was not comfortable answering these questions and many of his responses were off point. I formed the opinion there was little point in persisting with the interview and abandoned it prematurely….

11. Based on the information I was able to collect, Cyril demonstrates knowledge of the charge that he is facing but he does not know the details that underpin the charge. He is able to recall much of his behaviour surrounding the alleged offence, but there are gaps in his memory due in part to alcohol intoxication at that time. Cyril demonstrates little understanding of legal strategy and process. He is unable to recall and/or identify material of importance to his defence.

…

14. ... Cyril will be much better placed to assist in his defence when these gaps in his knowledge are filled. He has the intellectual capacity to process and identify important information but he will require assistance from his solicitor and the court to do so. Legal concepts will need to be carefully explained to support his understanding and reasoning about these matters and he will require more time than most people to process this information. His memory for language-based material is poor and important information will need to be written down for him”.

Dr Hepner

Dr Hepner addressed the Presser criteria in her report of 26 October 2012 and found that Mr Weazel was able to understand the charges against him and had the capacity to plead to a charge, however his ability to understand the full legal implications of entering a plea was less clear. He understood the nature of the proceedings and the substantial effect of evidence against him, but his ability to follow the course of proceedings was less certain. His impairments in areas of memory, vocabulary knowledge, non-verbal reasoning, planning, organisation and his variable speed of information processing would be expected to impact on his ability to follow proceedings in a courtroom.

Concerns were also raised with his ability to make out his defence, instruct and inform counsel of his version of the facts, and his capacity to decide what defence he will rely on.

Dr Hepner was of the opinion that Mr Weazel did not meet all the Presser standards.

Dr Furst

Dr Furst considered Dr Hepner’s opinion that Mr Weazel had the capacity to understand legal advice and stated as follows:

“Based on his presentation and interview and failure to understand and/or remember a number of questions put to him, I doubt he would have the capacity to understand legal advice in a meaningful way, or apply any understanding to his current legal problems and the trial at hand.”

Dr Furst summarised his findings as to fitness as follows:

“Mr Weazel has evidence of moderate-severe cognitive impairment, probably as a consequence of alcohol related brain damage and associated frontal lobe impairment. He was illogical, garrulous, disinhibited and easily irritated. He does not make sense and would struggle to answer basic questions of fact. He would be a vulnerable witness at trial, would probably struggle to attend to the court process or comprehend legal advice given to him, and would be unlikely to give coherent instructions to his legal counsel. He also lacks endurance. Having regard to the standards of Presser and Kesavarajah I was of the opinion that Mr Weazel was unfit to plead and unfit to be tried. Given his apparent cognitive impairment is likely to be of a permanent nature and nearly two years have elapsed since the alleged offences, I doubt he will become fit to be tried within the next 12 months.""

Dr Skinner

Having summarised the accused’s history, presentation and testing Dr Skinner expressed the following opinions:

“In my opinion Mr Weazel is not fit to stand trial. He does understand the nature of the charges against him and has some understanding of the functions of the officers of the court and his legal council (sic). However, I was not able to determine whether he is fully aware of the seriousness of the charges. He has only a limited understanding of the functions of officers of the court and he might have delusional ideas in relation to his legal advisers, or might misunderstand their advice.

I do not believe that he is capable of giving instructions to solicitors or properly understanding the meaning of evidence against him. I do not believe he would be able to follow proceedings in court.”

In relation to his prognosis Dr Skinner expressed the opinion that if he remained abstinent from alcohol,:

“some improvement in his cognitive functions would be expected over the next twelve to eighteen months. However, I do not expect that he would improve sufficiently to become fit to plead and to stand trial in the foreseeable future, and not within the next twelve months.”

Appropriate Findings On The Evidence

Section 14 of the Act provides that if following an inquiry an accused person is found unfit to be tried for an offence the Court must refer the person to the Mental Health Review Tribunal, and may make other orders including remanding an accused in custody.”


	
	The accused is in custody at the present time. It is likely, of course, that this present finding as to unfitness will necessarily affect the other proceedings, but I do not need to consider this question for present purposes.
	
	
	The accused was arrested and charged with inflict grievous bodily harm with intent on 27 July 2011. He was then bail refused for a period of time up until 15 September 2011. From that date he was on bail until he was arrested and charged for separate robbery offences on 18 May 2013. Upon the death of the victim the charge of 27 July 2011 was changed to murder.
	
	
	Section 14 of the Act provides that if following an inquiry the accused person is found unfit to be tried for an offence the court must refer the person to the Mental Health Review Tribunal and make other orders, including remanding an accused in custody.
	
	
	The findings which I think are appropriate and which are agreed by the parties are as follows:
	



	
	In accordance with s 14(a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, the matter is referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
	
	
	In accordance with s 14(b)(iii) of the Act, the accused is remanded in custody until the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal pursuant to s 16 of the Act.
	
	
	The Registrar is directed to provide the following documentation to the Mental Health Review Tribunal within 14 days:
	



	
	a copy of this judgment;
	
	
	a copy of the orders made;
	
	
	a copy of the transcript of the proceedings;
	
	
	a copy of the psychiatric reports; and,
	
	
	a copy of the Crown case statement.

Count 5 (and taking into account the first Form 1): Fixed term of imprisonment for three years commencing 4 July 2008 and expiring on 3 July 2011;

Count 2: Fixed term of imprisonment for three years commencing 4 July 2008 and expiring on 3 July 2011;

Count 1: A non-parole period of seven years commencing 4 July 2008 and expiring on 3 July 2015 with an additional term of three years to expire on 3 July 2018.

CAN Sequence 16 (and taking into account the second Form 1): A non-parole period of seven years commencing 4 July 2009 and expiring on 3 July 2016 with an additional term of three years to expire on 3 July 2019.

CAN Sequence 5: A non-parole period of eight years commencing from 4 July 2010 and expiring on 3 July 2018 with an additional term of four years to expire on 3 July 2022.

6The total effective non-parole period was 10 years commencing 4 July 2008 and expiring on 3 July 2018 with an additional term of 4 years expiring on 3 July 2022. 

7The first Form 1 contained the following offences:

(a) Possess firearm with altered/defaced identification mark (maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment);

(b) Possess prohibited weapon without permit (maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment - SNPP 3 years);

(c) Four counts of possessing ammunition (maximum penalty 50 penalty units);

(b) Goods in custody being $30,335 (maximum penalty 6 months imprisonment and/or 5 penalty units).

9The Applicant seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds:

(1) The sentence of 12 years imposed in relation to the offence against s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (CAN Sequence 5) is such that the Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance due to the disparity between his sentence and that imposed upon the co-offender Frank Sinkovich;

(2) The sentence of 12 years imposed in relation to the offence against s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (CAN Sequence 5) is manifestly excessive;

(3) The sentence imposed in relation to the offence against s 25A Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (CAN Sequence 16) is manifestly excessive;

(4) The sentence of 10 years imposed in relation to the offence against s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (Count 1 in the indictment) is manifestly excessive.

10The Applicant seeks also an extension of time to appeal. The Crown opposes an extension being given.

11The Crown also appeals against the sentence on the following two grounds:

(1) Error in the imposition of sentences which are manifestly inadequate;

(2) Error in the imposition of an aggregate sentence which is manifestly inadequate.

12The Crown's appeal was put forward only on the basis that the Court was otherwise minded to uphold any of the Applicant's grounds of appeal and to re-sentence the Applicant. The Crown's submission was that any reduction in the sentences, including the overall sentence, would fail to reflect the totality of the Applicant's overall very serious criminal conduct.

The facts

13The following is the summary of the agreed facts by the Sentencing Judge:

Ongoing supply (methylamphetamine) - s 25A (CAN Sequence 16)

14In May 2008 Operation Fiesta was formed to investigate the supply of methylamphetamine in the Minto and Claymore area. As part of this a controlled operation was authorised on 5 June 2008.

15On 12 June 2008 a police undercover operative (""UCO"") known as ""Peter"" attended Swettenham Road, Minto carrying $2,700 in cash. He wore a listening device. The Applicant was driven to this location by the co-offender Frank Sinkovich. Whilst Sinkovich waited by the car the Applicant went to the undercover operative's vehicle and supplied him with one ounce (31.8 grams gross weight) of methylamphetamine in exchange for the $2,700. That was later analysed and weighed showing a net total of 27.2 grams. 

16There was then conversation about a further supply. In this conversation the Applicant referred to ""Jack"" (co-offender Tutton) as a person who would chase money for him and that the UCO would meet him in the next week. The Applicant told the UCO that Jack was ""like my uncle...'cause my father's who we work for in this"". The Applicant told the UCO to bring an Esky or cooler next time to keep the methylamphetamine from drying out. The Applicant also gave the UCO a mobile number for future contact.

17On 18 June 2008 the UCO called the Applicant to arrange the purchase of two ounces. He was told the price would be ""five four"".

18On 20 June 2008 the UCO again drove to the Swettenham Road location and met with both the Applicant and Tutton. They supplied the UCO with 65.7 grams of methylamphetamine for $5,400. Later weighing indicated a net total of 53.3 grams.

19Discussion then took place about the possible future purchase of ""an elbow"". The UCO asked for a rough price. The Applicant said it would be about ""thirty"". Tutton stated that several weeks ago the prices were running between ""thirty and thirty-five"".

20Arrangements were later made for another meeting on 26 June 2008. On that day the UCO attended the same location. He called the Applicant's mobile phone and was told that he had organised for Tutton to attend. A short time later Tutton arrived and supplied the UCO with three ounces (98.5 grams) of methylamphetamine for $8,100. Later weighed it showed a net total of 81.8 grams. Discussion then turned to the price of an elbow. Tutton said he thought it would be ""thirty-two"". They agreed no one other than the Applicant and Tutton would attend for the big deal and that the money would be counted in the car.

21On 30 June 2008 the Applicant spoke to the UCO over the phone. The UCO told him that the deal could probably be organised early next week. Shortly after that conversation the Applicant called Sinkovich and asked if he could postpone the delivery for another week. Sinkovich said he would ""get it anyway as it didn't matter"". The Applicant said ""Okay but he said ""definitely next week"".

22On 2 July 2008 the UCO again attended Swettenham Road and met with the Applicant and Tutton. They supplied 66 grams of methylamphetamine for $5,400. The net weight indicated 53.9 grams. The Applicant then told the UCO that ""that thing"" (the elbow) was getting delivered to his house that day. He said, ""The boss has dropped it off at my house"". On 3 July 2008 the meeting in respect of the elbow was confirmed for 12 noon on 4 July 2008.

Supply prohibited drug (methylamphetamine), being not less than the commercial quantity 4 July 2008 (CAN Sequence 5)

23On 4 July 2008 the UCO met with the Applicant and Tutton just before midday at Swettenham Road for the supply of one pound (16 ounces) of methylamphetamine for $32,000. They entered the UCO 's car with the Applicant in the front passenger seat and Tutton in the rear. The Applicant removed three packages from a backpack. Tutton passed him an Esky from which the Applicant removed an ice-pack to keep the drugs cool. The total gross weight supplied to the UCO during this transaction was 512.8 grams. It was later analysed and weighed showing a net total of 443.8 grams. The UCO then handed over the money to the Applicant and as he began to count it other police officers moved in and all were arrested. The drugs were seized, as was the $32,000 in cash. The Applicant and Tutton were then taken back to the Macquarie Fields Police Station where they declined to be interviewed.

Count one: Supply prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) being not less than the commercial quantity - 4 July 2008. 

24At 12.20pm on that same day being 4 July 2008 search warrants were executed at premises at 11 Bernardo Street, Rosemeadow and 12 Longstaff Way, Claymore. The Applicant had been leasing the Bernardo Street address from his sister Samantha Edmonds. When the search warrant was executed Sinkovich was sitting on the lounge watching ""Underbelly"" on television. Sinkovich told the police that the house was not his but he had stayed there overnight. Police noticed that the bonnet of his car was still hot. 

25In a freezer in the kitchen police located a large resealable bag containing 18.4 grams (net) and two resealable bags containing 6.5 grams (net) of the same drug (methylamphetamine). In the laundry freezer they found a pink plastic case containing 395.7 grams (net); a specimen jar with 31.7 grams (net) of methylamphetamine; one resealable plastic bag containing 26.6 grams (net); eighteen small resealable plastic bags containing white residue (0.7 grams of methylamphetamine). All items were later analysed and found to be methylamphetamine and the net total weight was 479.6 grams. 

Count two: Cultivate prohibited plant. 

26During a search of the premises at 11 Bernardo Street police found in a room within the house eighteen cannabis plants grown by enhanced indoor means.

Counts three, four and five - possess unauthorised prohibited firearm, possess unregistered firearm, and possess a prohibited weapon without a permit. 

27During a search of the main bedroom police located in the wardrobe one .22 calibre Phoenix self-loading pistol with ID erased (the first matter on the Form 1 relating to Count 5) with two magazines in bubble wrap (count three). They also found a .22 calibre BSA Sportsman single shot rifle JB31077, (count four) and two Taser like devices (count five).

28The eight further matters on that Form 1 relate to other firearms and ammunition located within the premises at 11 Bernardo Street on that same day. 

29The two further matters on the other Form 1 (relating to CAN Sequence 16) relate to $30,335 in cash found within those premises and 1,650.4 grams of packaged and loose cannabis leaf found in the same room where the cannabis plants were growing.

Subjective factors

30The Sentencing Judge summarised the Applicant's subjective circumstances as follows. The Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing so that the detail of his background and circumstances came from reports which were tendered and from his sister who gave evidence.

31The Applicant was 37 years of age when sentenced and is now aged 41. While his criminal record was not an extensive one, and he had no prior drug related matters, it was nevertheless not one that would entitle him to leniency.

32The Applicant was the eldest of four children. He was apparently raised in a caring and supportive family environment and there were no significant issues during his childhood. He has apparently always been protective of his three sisters and when his parents were called upon to work long hours the Applicant felt he had a responsibility to care for them.

33He completed year ten at high school, achieving average results. After leaving the school he completed 12 months of a carpentry apprenticeship. He then worked building air conditioners for three months before commencing and completing a four year motor mechanics apprenticeship. He remained employed in that field for a further four years. Since that time he has been variously employed as a storeman, a truck driver, and most recently between 2005 and 2007 has conducted his own landscaping/home maintenance business.

34He informed the probation officer that he used cannabis between the ages of 14 and 24, and would use amphetamines and ecstasy on weekends approximately once a month throughout his life. However, he maintained that his use of illicit drugs was not a factor in respect of the commission of the present offences.

35He commenced a 14 year relationship when he was about 20 years of age and he has three children now aged 17, 11 and 10 from that relationship. He said he went through a difficult separation with his ex-partner around Christmas 2006. However, he remained on friendly terms with her and had been assisting with the care of his children while she in fact studied full time at TAFE from about mid 2007 until he was arrested in respect of the present offences. Since his incarceration that relationship had become strained and his ex-partner refused to allow him any contact with his children. It seems that the Applicant did not necessarily want his children seeing him in a custodial environment. The Applicant also informed the probation officer that he entered a new relationship about six months prior to his arrest but that that had also ended. He apparently remained unemployed since about 2007 and was not in receipt of Centrelink benefits.

36He advised the probation officer that he is a member of the Rebels Outlaws motorcycle gang, joining in 1999. He was the sergeant at arms of the Wollongong chapter between 2004 and 2006 and was the secretary of the chapter from 2006 up until his arrest in July 2008. He adamantly denied that this association was a factor in the commission of the present offences.

37The Applicant's parents and sisters all resided in Queensland. His mother indicated that whilst the family was disappointed in respect of his involvement in the offences the family would continue to support him.

38Ms Crystal Slack, the Applicant's sister, confirmed that the Applicant had indeed provided much comfort and support to all of his sisters both growing up and in their adult lives. She said he was a person that was always there for them.

39In both the pre-sentence report and the report of the psychologist Mr Diment the Applicant sought to provide a reason for his involvement in these offences. To the probation officer he indicated in part, that a friend owed a large drug debt and that he (the Applicant) had agreed to be that person's bodyguard/security and that he was attempting to assist his friend work off that drug debt by supplying drugs. A similar explanation appeared in the psychologist's report. In accordance with the principle in R v Quatami [2001] NSWCCA 353; (2001) 127 A Crim R 369 at [58]-[59] the Sentencing Judge correctly placed little weight on those untested assertions.

40In his report the psychologist, Mr Diment, stated that the Applicant was suffering from anxiety and depression. He said:

While some of this is reasonably due to his current circumstances and pre-sentence, he is genuinely concerned about his children and family's welfare. He appears to have had a tough upbringing and he has always considered himself responsible for protecting his family. A role which he takes seriously.

41The Applicant informed the psychologist that he regretted his actions:

big time, like you wouldn't believe...now will not be involved in anything like this that is in my power to do so...upset over the implications for others, not just me...family, kids...issues of drugs and all that for those into that rubbish.

42Mr Diment stated:

In regards to his favourable prognosis and rehabilitation prospects, in his favour is a basically well-adjusted ""core"" personality and he has a good work ethic. His main passion in life involves cars and motorbikes and he told me that people in his motorcycle club 'Are on my back big time about my stupidity in all this...I reckon I have learned the hard way...I won't get another chance from them.

The Sentencing Judge said that that statement might qualify for an expression of regret but it could not be put any higher than that. 

43The Sentencing Judge said that the fact that at thirty-seven years of age the Applicant did not have any extensive criminal record and that he had had a continuous working history gave him some hope that the Applicant had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.

Applicant's appeal

Extension of time

44The Applicant was sentenced on 23 October 2009.

45On 12 November 2009 the Applicant's then solicitor filed a notice of intention to Appeal. At or about the same time an application was made to Legal Aid for the Appeal.

46The Applicant's present solicitor first received instructions on 21 October 2010 to act on behalf of the Applicant under a grant of legal aid for the purpose of obtaining an advice from counsel as to the merits of the proposed appeal. An advice was received from counsel dated 5 July 2011. Thereafter, the solicitor ceased to act for the Applicant.

47In the meantime, the co-offender Sinkovich applied for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him by Judge Conlon on 6 November 2009. The appeal was heard on 5 April 2011 and was dismissed on 15 April 2011.

48On about 18 June 2012 the Applicant's present solicitor was contacted by Legal Aid to inform him that in the light of the High Court's decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 the Applicant's grant of Legal Aid had been extended to obtain a further opinion of counsel regarding an appeal against the severity of sentence.
49On specific instructions of the Applicant the solicitor sent a brief to advise to Mr Hament Dhanji SC. Mr Dhanji had warned the solicitor that he was unable to attend to the matter immediately because of other commitments. The solicitor received Mr Dhanji's advice on about 16 November 2012. A further extension of time was then sought on 11 December 2012. The Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed on 18 December 2012.

50In his affidavit in support of the application for extension the solicitor for the Applicant said that it had always been the intention of the Applicant to lodge an appeal against the severity of the sentence. There was no affidavit from the Applicant.

51The Crown opposed the extension of time because, it was submitted, there was no explanation as to why there was no application for an extension until the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed. 

52It must be said at the outset that the explanation for the delay in appealing is sparse and unsatisfactory. There is no real explanation for the period from 12 November 2009 until 21 October 2010 (it is not said, for example, that the delay was the fault of Legal Aid) and there is no explanation at all for the period from 5 July 2011 until June 2012 when the solicitor was contacted by Legal Aid as a result of the review of decisions affected by Muldrock.

53Moreover, although the submissions concerning Ground 2 suggested a Muldrock error (because it was said the Sentencing Judge focused on objective gravity and altered the non-parole period accordingly) in oral submissions Senior Counsel for the Applicant disavowed specific reliance on a Muldrock error. Accordingly, the delay from July 2011 until June 2012 and beyond cannot be explained by a desire to take advantage of the position brought about by Muldrock in relation to convictions where no appeal had been brought at an earlier time and by reason of the case falling within the purview of the Standard Non-Parole Review Team of Legal Aid.
54The need for a satisfactory explanation has been emphasised in a number of cases: R v Sunderland (1927) 28 SR (NSW) 26 at 27 (""substantial reasons to be advanced""); R v Lawrence [1980] 1 NSWLR 122 at 148 and McCall v R [2010] NSWCCA 174 at [7] (""exceptional circumstances"" need to be shown, especially where there has been considerable delay).

55In Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 Johnson J (with whom Allsop P and Kirby J agreed) said:

[8] The court has a discretion with respect to extension of time under s 10(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In exercising that discretion, the court has regard to the prospects of success on the application for leave to appeal itself: R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275 at [30]ff. The court will usually require some satisfactory explanation as to why an appeal was not brought within the time allowed, especially if the delay is considerable: R v Beattie [2000] NSWCCA 201 at [17].

56Similarly in Flack v R [2011] NSWCCA 167; (2011) 205 A Crim R 138 Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreed) said:


[7] This Court has emphasised the clear public interest in the avoidance of delay in bringing appeals to this Court and the demanding test to be applied where an extension of time is sought: McCall v R [2010] NSWCCA 174 at [5]-[7]; Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [38]-[39]. It is appropriate to assess the merits of the Applicant's ground of appeal for the purpose of determining whether an extension of time ought be granted in this case.

57In Etchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 262; (2010) 205 A Crim R 138 Campbell JA (with Latham and Price JJ agreed) made reference to a number of decisions including what was said by Johnson J in Edwards and continued:

[24] Even so, the ""powerful considerations supporting the finality of judicial decisions"", to which Hodgson JA referred [in R v Gregory [2002] NSWCCA 199 at [38]-[41]], apply to applications to extend the time for appeal against sentence. As well, when a time limit has been laid down through legislation, it would be subverting the intention of the legislation for this court to consider the matter as though it were an application for leave to appeal against sentence brought within time, and if such an application would succeed, regard that as a sufficient reason for extending the time. I recognise that ""exceptional circumstances"" are not, in so many words, expressly made part of the statutory scheme for granting an extension of time to appeal (Arja v R [2010] NSWCCA 190 at [4]-[5], cf McCall v R [2010] NSWCCA 174 at [5]-[7]). Even so, it seems to me that the need to give weight to the factors I have just mentioned in operating the statutory scheme must call for something beyond the presence of factors that would be sufficient to result in a sentence being varied if an application for leave to appeal against sentence were brought within time.

58It is appropriate, therefore, to examine the merits of the application for leave to appeal against the sentence before reaching a final view about whether an extension of time should be allowed.

Ground 1: Parity with Frank Sinkovich

59Sinkovich pleaded not guilty. On 6 July 2009 following trial a jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of two counts as follows:

Count 1: On 12 June 2008 he knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine;

Count 2: That between 29 June 2008 and 5 July 2008 he did supply a prohibited drug being not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine.

60Count 2 concerned the same transaction charged as CAN Sequence 5 against the Applicant. Count 1 was concerned with the same acts as constituted the on-going supply against the Applicant (CAN Sequence 16). Count 2 is relevant because it is necessary to consider the total effective sentences imposed on each of the Applicant and Sinkovich.

61Judge Conlon sentenced Sinkovich on 6 November 2009 as follows:
Count 1: A non-parole period of two years commencing 4 July 2008 and expiring 3 July 2010 with an additional term of two years to expire 3 July 2012;

Count 2: A non-parole period of nine years commencing 4 July 2009 and expiring 3 July 2018.

62The total effective sentence was a non-parole period of 10 years with a balance of term of 4 years. 

63An appeal to this Court by Sinkovich was unsuccessful: Sinkovich v R [2011] NSWCCA 90. In that appeal Sinkovich argued a parity ground based on the sentence the Applicant received in respect of CAN Sequence 5 and argued that the sentences were manifestly excessive.

64There was nothing in particular in Sinkovich's subjective circumstances to distinguish him from the Applicant apart from the fact that he was aged 54 at the time of sentence. He had only a minor criminal record. The Sentencing Judge thought that he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. However, he showed no remorse, maintaining his innocence in the face of what the Sentencing Judge described as an overwhelming prosecution case. Like the Applicant he belonged to the Wollongong Chapter of the Rebels Motor Cycle Club, having previously been its president.

65When sentencing the Applicant in relation to the supply of not less than the commercial quantity of the prohibited drug the Sentencing Judge said that it involved a considerable degree of planning being negotiations in respect of price and the timeframe when delivery could be made. It involved the Applicant contacting Sinkovich who would organise for the collection of the commercial quantity and bring it to a location where the Applicant could collect it and then on supply it to the UCO. His Honour assessed the objective seriousness as far as the Applicant was concerned as falling above the mid range but not at the upper end of the range. 

66When sentencing Sinkovich for the same offence his Honour again said that it indicated a considerable degree of planning involving negotiations in respect of the price and the timeframe for delivery. He said Sinkovich was the ""go to"" man for the supply and it involved Sinkovich organising for the supply and collection of the drug and then organising its supply to the Applicant so he could on supply it to the UCO. This involved a driver being organised to take the Applicant and the co-offender Tutton to the Swettenham Road location. Sinkovich then waited at the Applicant's premises while the transaction was taking place. 

67The Sentencing Judge assessed Sinkovich as being slightly above the Applicant in the hierarchy. He assessed the objective seriousness of the offence as far as Sinkovich was concerned as falling slightly above the mid range. 

68The Applicant's principal complaint at the hearing of this appeal concerning parity was that, taking into account the 25% discount that he received for an early plea, that notional starting point for his sentence was 16 years with a non-parole period of ten years and eight months. That was a starting point three years longer than the sentence imposed upon Sinkovich despite the fact that the Sentencing Judge had found the Applicant being in a lower position in the hierarchy than Sinkovich. It was submitted by the Applicant that there were no other factors present subjective or otherwise to justify the higher starting point. Further, a starting point of 16 years was closer to the maximum sentence available and included a non-parole period that was higher than the standard non-parole period.

69The Crown submitted that this argument should be determined to be academic. This was because the overall sentence was lenient. Interference with the sentence in respect of this count would result in a manifestly inadequate overall sentence.

70The Crown also submitted that even if disparity is found that does not, of itself, mean that the appeal must be allowed. The disparity must be marked. Further, reference was made to Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [33] and [105] which approved Simpson J's statement in R v Steele (Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 April 1997, Unreported), that the existence of a discretion to reduce a co-offender's sentence where unjustified disparity is shown does not amount to an obligation to do so.

71It should first be said that the proper enquiry is not whether the overall sentence was appropriate or lenient but whether, when the sentences for two identical counts (one charged against each of the Applicant and Mr Sinkovich) are compared, the Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the disparity of the sentences: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [48]; Sinkovich at [66].

72Further, the statement of Simpson J was made in the context of the reduction of a sentence to one which would have been inadequate. In such a case, it would be an appropriate exercise of the discretion not to reduce the sentence. In the present case it cannot be said that a reduction of the sentence for parity reasons would result in a manifestly inadequate sentence for that offence.

73In my opinion, viewed overall, the findings of objective seriousness in relation to the same offence charged against each of the Applicant and Sinkovich are relatively equal and the distinction the Sentencing Judge made that Sinkovich was slightly above the Applicant in the hierarchy would of itself require no different sentence to be given to each of the offenders. There was no real difference in their subjective circumstances and the difference in relation to any remorse was minimal particularly bearing in mind that the Applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. 

74The significant matter is that, all other things being relatively equal, the notional starting point for the Applicant was three years above that of Sinkovich. Although the two offenders were sentenced by the same judge only weeks apart and the judge made reference to their comparative roles in the offence no reasons are provided by the judge for the difference in the starting point in the sentences. The difference was not insignificant (23%) and it had the effect of denying to the Applicant almost the entirety of the discount he was otherwise given for an early plea. 

75Whilst the difference in their roles as found by the judge was such that the same sentence for each would not have resulted in a justifiable sense of grievance on the Applicant's part, the imposition of a higher sentence to the extent of three years (before the discount for the early plea) on the Applicant with the lesser role and in the absence of other aggravating factors results in a justifiable sense of grievance.

76This ground is made out. Nothing in the evidence suggests otherwise than that the notional starting point for each offender should be the same. Subject to other matters which I shall mention later, with a discount of 25% for the early plea, and maintaining the ratio employed by the Sentencing Judge the Applicant should be sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months with an additional term of 3 years and 3 months. 

Ground 2: The offence in CAN Sequence 5 - manifestly excessive

77In the light of the conclusion regarding ground 1 this ground can be dealt with briefly. 

78The Applicant's submissions point to two matters said to result in the sentence being manifestly excessive. The first is a Muldrock type error on the basis that the Sentencing Judge has placed too much significance on his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. This is because he found that the offence was above the mid range and the undiscounted non-parole period, if s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 was applied without special circumstances being found, would result in a non-parole period two years higher than the standard non-parole period. Secondly, it was submitted that the determination of objective seriousness involved error based on comparative cases and sentencing statistics. 

79Since Ground 1 is made out, it is no longer necessary to determine this ground. I adopt, however, the remarks of Johnson J in Shortland v R [2013] NSWCCA 4 where a similar issue arose:

[147] It is sufficient to observe that a substantial sentence was imposed, which was partly cumulative. However, where an offender is sentenced for several offences so that the principles of concurrency, accumulation and totality are brought into play, it is necessary for this Court to take care where challenge is made to one particular sentence of those which are imposed, so as to guard against an element of artificiality being introduced: R v Thalari [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 at 320 [82]. The Court must keep in mind the obligation of a sentencing court to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence in accordance with the principles in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. However, the selection of one sentence for challenge as being manifestly excessive, from a range of several partly accumulated sentences, requires particular caution on the part of this Court.

Ground 3: Sentence for ongoing supply - manifestly excessive

80The Applicant submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive for these reasons:

(a) The Applicant's system and methods of supply were not particularly sophisticated and he made little effort to conceal his offending conduct;

(b) The Applicant was not at the top of the supply chain and was the one exposing himself to risk by attending the occasions of supply;

(c) The drugs were of an extremely low purity and the Sentencing Judge failed to have regard to that;

(d) The Sentencing Judge failed to take account of the fact that the supplies occurred as part of a controlled operation and were made to an undercover police officer with the result that the drugs were not actually disseminated into the community.

81Whilst some matters such as the purity of the drugs might have been factors which would suggest a lesser degree of objective seriousness there were sufficient matters associated with the ongoing supply that meant that his Honour's assessment was entirely appropriate. Such matters included the fact that there were four supplies within the specified period, that each of the amounts of drugs supplied well exceeded the indictable quantity and that the four supplies were not isolated events because of the ongoing conversation with the UCO to supply what was described the ""elbow"". Moreover, the number of weapons and ammunition found in the house entirely justified the Sentencing Judge's conclusion that the operation was a sophisticated one. 

82Nor can it be overlooked that the first of the offences on the Form 1 (taken into account on this offence) was a serious offence carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The amount of cannabis leaf was within the range of being an indictable quantity. Finally, assessing the measure of objective seriousness is within the domain of the Sentencing Judge subject only to error of the House v The King type being established: Aldous v R [2012] NSWCCA 153 at [38]. No such error is demonstrated.

83Whilst the Applicant might be able to point to other cases that suggested the sentence for this count was high, his counsel acknowledged that care must be taken when comparing sentences imposed in ongoing supply cases: R v Cheikh; R v Hoete [2004] NSWCCA 448 at [64]. There are numerous references in other cases to the care which needs to be taken in comparing sentences generally in other cases: R v Gidaro [2005] NSWCCA 18 at [26]-[28]; Lorraway v R [2010] NSWCCA 46 at [37]-[38], and R v Araya [2005] NSWCCA 283;(2005) 155 A Crim R 555 where Johnson J with whom Simpson and Rothman JJ agreed said at [70] that a number of cases in this Court had emphasised that far greater assistance was derived from references to general sentencing policy than with comparing sentences in individual cases. 

84As the Applicant acknowledges general deterrence is an important factor in sentencing for this offence: R v CBK [2002] NSWCCA 457; (2002) 135 A Crim R 260 at [56]-[57].

85This ground is not made out.

Ground 4: Sentence for count 1 - manifestly excessive

86The Applicant relied on submissions in relation to Grounds 2 and 3. Additionally the Applicant submitted that it was significant that no drugs were actually disseminated into the community: R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66 at [117].

87His Honour said that it did not matter that the drugs were not actually supplied - they were going to be supplied. In that regard his Honour assessed the objective seriousness in the mid-range. The starting point for the sentence was a little below 9.5 years. It cannot be said that the sentence, though certainly not a light one, was not within the range of sentences in all the circumstances.

88This ground is not made out.

Outcome of the appeal

89If time was extended in the present case the result would be that it would be necessary to re-sentence the Applicant because of his success in relation to Ground 1 based on parity. It would then be necessary to consider the Crown's appeal which would involve a consideration of the proposed new sentence in respect of CAN Sequence 5 (referred to in paragraph [76] above.

90In my opinion the matter can be approached this way. If the Applicant was to be re-sentenced for CAN Sequence 5 it would then be necessary to consider principles of concurrency, accumulation and totality: Shortland v R at [147]. A consideration of those matters leads me to the conclusion that, from the perspective of totality, an effective sentence for all matters is precisely the effective overall sentence which was imposed.

91The overall sentence covered three serious drug supply offences and a number of serious firearm offences before the lesser offences are considered. The co-offender Sinkovich was charged and sentenced as set out in paragraphs [59] to [62] above for the two offences referred to, one of which (Count 2) was identical to CAN Sequence 5 charged against the Applicant and the other of which arose out of the same facts as CAN Sequence 16 charged against the Applicant. 

92He appealed to this Court, arguing that the sentences were manifestly excessive. This Court dismissed the appeal saying:

[62] It follows that the sentence passed, both in total and in relation to the individual offences, was well open to his Honour and albeit towards the top of the range of sentences for offences of this kind, was well within the range of the permissible exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion. Error has not been demonstrated. Accordingly, grounds of appeal 1 and 2 have not been made out. (emphasis added)

93Any overall sentence less than the Sentencing Judge imposed upon the Applicant would not be warranted. This is not to enter upon the debate concerning whether s 6(3) refers only to individual sentences or extends to the totality of sentences imposed upon an appellant (see the differing views in Arnaout v R [2008] NSWCCA 278; (2008) 191 A Crim R 149). It is simply to recognise that regard must be had to the total effective sentence to see that it represents a proper period of incarceration for the totality of the criminality involved: R v AEM Snr [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [70].

94There is power by virtue of s 7(1) and/or (1A) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to have regard to the overall sentence imposed and to correct anomalies that may result from the alteration to one particular sentence: Ryan v The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 1 at 22-23 and 25; R H McL v R [2000] HCA 46; (2000) 203 CLR 452 at [32]-[33]. So, in R v Knight [2005] NSWCCA 253; (2005) 155 A Crim R 252 Johnson J (with whom Mason P & Barr J agreed) restructured a large number of sentences to comply with proper sentencing principles resulting in the same overall sentence and the same non-parole period that had been imposed by the judge at first instance.

95If this Court was to re-sentence the Applicant the sentences would be structured in a manner that would adjust the concurrency and accumulation to produce the same overall sentence. In those circumstances, although the Applicant has demonstrated error in regard to parity in respect of CAN Sequence 5 there is ultimately no merit in the appeal. That lack of merit assists in informing the result of the extension application for the reasons given in paragraphs [55] to [58] above.

96As referred to earlier, the explanation (such as it is) for the period from November 2009 to June 2012 is entirely unsatisfactory. The delay extends from 23 October 2009 until 18 December 2012. 

97In McCall the delay concerned a period of two years and the appeal was a conviction appeal on a charge of murder. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the issue this Court held that exceptional circumstances had not been shown and that there was no merit in the ground of appeal.

98In Edwards the delay was two and half years, no merit was found in the grounds of appeal and even if there had been no lesser sentence was found to be warranted. An extension of time was refused - see at [60]-[61]. In Flack the delay was 20 months and in Etchell it was 3 years. In each case no merit was found in the appeal grounds and an extension of time was refused.
99In my opinion where this Court determined the co-offender's appeal also based partly on parity on 15 April 2011, where there is no satisfactory explanation for the delay for most of the period, where the appeal has apparently only been triggered by contact from Legal Aid because the case was thought to involve a Muldrock point but where there was a disavowal of reliance on Muldrock at the hearing of the appeal, where the outcome of the appeal will not result in an alteration to the overall sentence, and having regard to the public interest in the avoidance of delay in bringing appeals to this Court, the application for the extension of time to appeal should be refused.

100It is not necessary, therefore, to consider the Crown appeal.

101In my opinion the following orders should be made:

(1)Leave to appeal refused.

(2)Dismiss the appeal by the Crown.


102BARR AJ: I agree with Davies J.

2419784,Small v R [2013] NSWCCA 165,"Judgment

1EMMETT JA: This appeal against conviction and application for leave to appeal against sentence arise out of the tragic death of six passengers in a workboat that collided with a fishing trawler off Bradley's Head in Sydney Harbour in the early morning of 1 May 2008. The appellant, Mr Percy Small, was convicted of six counts of dangerous navigation occasioning death, under s 52B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years. 

Circumstances of the Collision 

2On the night of 30 April 2008, various people gathered at the Commercial Hotel (the Hotel) in Balmain. The Hotel had been sold and was to be handed over to the new owners on the following day. Staff had been informed that their employment would not continue and the gathering was in the nature of a farewell celebration. Mr Small was present at the gathering. 

3Mr Matthew Reynolds was also present at the gathering. Mr Reynolds was employed in the business of Sydney Ship Repairs and, in that capacity, had access to a workboat owned by his employer. The workboat was licensed to carry eight people. The workboat was not available to Mr Reynolds for private purposes, such as recreational use or fishing. Mr Reynolds was the holder of a certificate of competency as a coxswain. He was thereby authorised to undertake the duties of master of a vessel less than 12 metres in length with propulsion power less than 250 kilowatts. The workboat was in that category. 

4During the course of the evening, Mr Gene Robson, who was employed as the night manager at the Hotel, asked Mr Reynolds if he would take him to Watsons Bay by boat. The purpose of the journey was to take keys to the current owners of the Hotel so that they could be handed to the new owners on the following day. 

5Mr Reynolds agreed to take Mr Robson to Watsons Bay, and he and his girlfriend, Ms Ashlie Ayres, went to get the workboat. After the Hotel closed at midnight, a number of those present at the gathering at the Hotel went to a nearby residence, referred to by the witnesses as ""Pondy's place"". Mr Reynolds took the workboat to East Balmain wharf. All twelve persons who were at Pondy's place made their way to the wharf and boarded the workboat. Thus, a total of 14 people were on the workboat, which was licensed to carry no more than eight people. 

6Most of the people on the workboat, including Mr Reynolds and Mr Small, had consumed alcohol in various quantities during the night. Marijuana and cocaine had also been used by several of the people. A quantity of alcohol as well as marijuana and an implement used for the ingestion of drugs were taken on board the workboat. Cocaine was also available on the workboat. 

7The workboat left East Balmain wharf at about 1:23am, with Mr Reynolds at the helm. They proceeded to Watsons Bay. At some point during the journey, Mr Reynolds permitted one of the passengers, Mr Jarrod Chivers, to drive the workboat for approximately 5 minutes. Mr Chivers was the holder of a boat licence. When Mr Robson saw Mr Chivers driving the boat, he told Mr Reynolds that he, Mr Reynolds, should be driving. Mr Reynolds then took back the helm and drove the workboat to the wharf at Watsons Bay. 

8All 14 individuals on board disembarked at Watsons Bay. The female passengers accompanied Mr Robson in delivering the keys to the owner of the Hotel. The rest of the complement went to a nearby park, where alcohol and drugs were consumed by some of them. 

9After about half an hour, all 14 individuals re-boarded the workboat and Mr Reynolds drove it from Watsons Bay wharf to a harbour light marker known as the ""Wedding Cake"". Three of the men on board, including Mr Small, climbed onto the Wedding Cake. After they re-boarded the workboat, Mr Reynolds drove away from the Wedding Cake, heading towards Bradley's Head. 

10The workboat had two seats facing forwards, one on the port side, or left side, of the workboat and the other on the starboard, or right side, of the workboat. The helm was in front of the starboard seat and the occupier of the starboard seat had access to the throttle. The starboard seat, located immediately behind the helm, might fairly be described as the driver's seat. The seat to the left of the starboard seat might fairly be described as the passenger's seat. Behind the two seats were longitudinal benches on each side, facing inwards. When the workboat left the Wedding Cake, Mr Reynolds was behind the helm, in the starboard seat, and Ms Ayres was in the passenger's seat. Mr Small was sitting on the starboard bench immediately behind Mr Reynolds. 

11At about 2:30am, shortly after leaving the Wedding Cake, Mr Reynolds turned to Mr Small, pointed to the starboard seat and said ""sit here"". Mr Small did not have a boat licence and had never driven a boat similar to the workboat before. However, he climbed into the starboard seat. Mr Reynolds said to him ""head towards that green marker"". Mr Small could see a green light in the distance, which was, in fact, the marker light off Bradley's Head. Mr Small changed the course of the workboat ""a degree"" to straighten the course of the workboat, as he said it was heading ""just a touch to the left of the marker"". He stayed behind the helm for two or three minutes. When the workboat was about 400 metres from the green marker, Mr Reynolds, who was standing between the two seats talking to Ms Ayres, leaned over to him and said:

""Make a hard left. That's a peninsula.""

Mr Small turned the workboat to the left ""so we would pass Bradley's Head by about 100 metres"". Mr Small in cross-examination agreed that he did not make a hard left but rather a sweeping turn.

12At about 2am on 1 May 2008, the fishing trawler, ""Jordons"", departed Blackwattle Bay with its skipper, Mr Peter Evans, at the helm. At about 2:30am, the fishing trawler rounded Bradley's Head on a course with its bow approaching the bow of the workboat from the workboat's port side. The fishing trawler was proceeding at about 8 to 9 knots and the workboat was travelling at between 20 and 25 knots. Neither Mr Evans nor Mr Small sighted the other vessel in time to take action to avoid a collision. 

13The vessels collided. The fairlead on the point of the bow of the trawler swept along the port side of the workboat. The six fatally injured persons were on the port side of the workboat. The angle of the collision was approximately 15 degrees on the starboard of the trawler. At the time of the collision the conditions were generally very good. There was no breeze and the water surface was rippled or calm. 

The Prosecution

14On 22 February 2010, Mr Small was indicted before a judge of the Common Law Division on six counts of dangerous navigation occasioning death, pursuant to s 52B(1) of the Crimes Act. By the indictment, the Director of Public Prosecutions charged in six counts that Mr Small, on 1 May 2008 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did navigate a vessel, namely an aluminium workboat registered number 53585, whilst under the influence of intoxicating liquor and drugs, whereby the vessel was involved in an impact as a result of which the death of six individuals was occasioned. Mr Reynolds was indicated on six counts of manslaughter, with six counts of aiding and abetting dangerous navigation occasioning death in the alternative to the manslaughter counts. Both pleaded not guilty to each count charged and they were tried together. 

15On 6 April 2010, the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of each charge against Mr Small. Mr Reynolds was found guilty on each of the six charges of manslaughter. On 25 June 2010, Mr Small and Mr Reynolds were sentenced. The total effective sentence was 7 years and 6 months with an effective non-parole period of 5 years for each of Messrs Small and Reynolds. 

16Section 52B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act provides that a person is guilty of the offence of dangerous navigation occasioning death if a vessel navigated by the person is involved in an impact occasioning death of another person and the person navigating the vessel was, at the time of the impact, navigating the vessel under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug. A person convicted of an offence under s 52B(1) is liable to imprisonment for up to ten years. 

The Trial

17It was not in issue that Mr Small was under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Nor was it an issue that, at the time of the collision, he was sitting in the starboard seat behind the helm. His case at the trial was that, nevertheless, he was not navigating the workboat. Accordingly, at the close of the Crown case, he made a submission that no prima facie case had been made out against him and applied for orders that verdicts of acquittal be directed. He contended that his physical control of the helm did not constitute navigating the workboat within the meaning of s 52B of the Crimes Act. Rather, he asserted, it was Mr Reynolds, as the master or skipper of the workboat, who was navigating it. 

18The trial judge rejected the application. His Honour considered that the submission advanced on behalf of Mr Small, that he was merely holding the wheel, ignored his capacity to control the direction in which the workboat travelled by his manipulation of the helm. While Mr Small was at the helm, he was in a position, independently, to alter the direction in which the workboat travelled. Further, his Honour said, Mr Small's position at the helm also gave him access to the throttle, which determined the speed of the workboat. Thus, it was Mr Small who was in the position to avoid obstacles by steering clear of buoys, markers and other vessels. His Honour declined to direct acquittal on the six counts upon which Mr Small stood indicted. 

19In his summing up to the jury, the trial judge directed that, for the purposes of the trial they should treat the word navigating as meaning controlling the helm of the workboat at the time of impact. His Honour told the jury that the word navigation could have a wide meaning. Thus, for example, on a cruise liner or warship, one of the officers below the bridge, with a pair of dividers and a ruler, might be said to be navigating the ship. It might also be said that the captain on the bridge of a large ship is navigating the ship. His Honour repeated, however, that, in the context of the case before the jury, navigating involved controlling the helm of the workboat. His Honour repeated several times that navigating as charged against Mr Small was being in control of the helm or controlling the helm of the workboat at the relevant time. His Honour told the jury that the question was whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time of impact, Mr Small was controlling the helm of the workboat. 

Remarks on Sentence

20In his remarks on sentence of 25 June 2010, the sentencing judge, who was the trial judge, observed that the fishing trawler, an extremely well-lit and easily visible displacement vessel, moving at a relatively slow speed, was struck by the workboat, a highly manoeuvrable vessel approaching it at three times its speed. His Honour was satisfied that the cause of the collision was the failure of the workboat to make use of its manoeuvrability in order to pass the fishing trawler to its port, in the appropriate fashion. 

21The sentencing judge considered that the culpability of Mr Reynolds stemmed from the circumstances in which he passed the helm of the workboat to Mr Small and his failure to discharge his responsibilities as skipper of the workboat. His Honour considered that an important element in assessing that culpability was what Mr Reynolds knew or ought to have known about Mr Small's condition. 

22His Honour found that, before arriving at the Hotel, Mr Small had smoked cannabis. While at the Hotel, he had eight to ten beers, served in schooner glasses, although he may not have consumed all of the contents. Mr Small also drank a shot of spirits. Later, he smoked more cannabis when at Pondy's place, and drank more beer on the journey to, and when he was at, Watson's Bay. He had ingested cocaine at the Hotel and he may have done so at Watsons Bay. His Honour found that, at the time when Mr Small took over the helm of the workboat and when the collision occurred, he was significantly impaired by his ingestion of alcohol and drugs. At the time when the collision occurred, the most likely concentration of alcohol was about 0.124 grams per 100 millilitres of blood. Indeed, Mr Small's case advocated a finding that he was considerably affected by the substances that he had consumed. 

23The sentencing judge found that the consequent impairments operated on Mr Small's performance skills including motor coordination, ability to maintain vigilance, prudence in decision-making about risk-taking behaviour, perceptions, ability to process information and general alertness. An additional effect was that his vision would have had a tunnel-like limitation and his reaction times to any perceptions would be slowed. His Honour was satisfied that the combined effect of the consumption of alcohol, cannabis and cocaine was so detrimental to Mr Small's physical person that it would have been obvious to Mr Small and to any reasonable observer that he was not in a fit state to perform a task such as steering a vessel. 

24The sentencing judge accepted that there was no prior arrangement for Mr Small to take over control of the helm during the trip on the harbour. Mr Small did not inform Mr Reynolds, directly or indirectly, that he was licensed to operate the workboat. Mr Small had a certificate that was required by employers to be held by anyone working on a boat, even as a barman or a deckhand. However, such a certificate is entirely irrelevant to having the training or licence to control a vessel. His Honour did not consider that the short time during which Mr Small was in fact at the helm was a mitigating factor. His Honour cited the analogy of a person who was materially affected by prior ingestion of intoxicating liquor and drugs taking over the driving of a motor vehicle and colliding with another vehicle at the next intersection, resulting in deaths. 

25His Honour considered that the offences of which Mr Small was convicted could be treated as mirror offences of dangerous driving of a motor vehicle causing death. His Honour considered that the circumstances of the case emphasised that the same risks exist when vessels are being navigated upon the waters as exist when motor vehicles are driven on a public road. 

26Although Mr Reynolds gave some abbreviated oral directions to Mr Small, concerning steering and turning, the sentencing judge did not accept that Mr Small was simply an instrument under the control of Mr Reynolds. Nor did his Honour accept that Mr Small felt obliged to carry out only exactly what he was told by Mr Reynolds, as the skipper of the workboat. His Honour considered that, once Mr Small was at the helm, he was in control of the direction in which the workboat travelled. Having that control, he could steer it clear of obstacles, whether they consisted of other vessels, structures on the harbour or the shore itself. He was not, as his Honour put it, ""a mere puppet"" waiting for Mr Reynolds to manipulate the strings.

27Given the amount and variety of his consumption of substances, which Mr Small realised had the tendency to affect him with attributes of intoxication, the sentencing judge considered that Mr Small's level of abuse of alcohol and drugs was a significant factor in assessing the degree of his culpability. His Honour also considered that it was a significant factor that, while he was in charge of steering the workboat, Mr Small was putting a large number of people at risk. 

28Mr Small was aged 26 when sentenced and had no prior convictions. His early life was disruptive and, after his parents divorced, he moved backwards and forwards between households in Queensland and New South Wales. The sentencing judge concluded that Mr Small succumbed to the use of illicit drugs and overindulgence in alcohol partly as a consequence of lack of a consistent source of guidance and partly the fact that he was living independently shortly after leaving school. 

29The Crown accepted that Mr Small's prospects of rehabilitation were good and that he was unlikely to re-offend. His Honour observed that the offences were obviously unplanned and unintended, as neither Mr Reynolds nor Mr Small intended to cause harm or death. Nevertheless, the offences for which they were convicted were specifically designed to deal with unintended fatal consequences. Although those consequences may have been unintended, it was Mr Small's decision, in his state of being affected by alcohol and drugs, which he knew he had consumed, to take control of the helm of the workboat, with the risks attendant upon it for those on board, that occasioned six deaths. 

30The sentencing judge considered that the circumstances constituted a very high level of irresponsible behaviour. When imposing sentence on Messrs Reynolds and Small, his Honour was conscious of the differences in the maximum penalty for the offences charged. His Honour accepted that the culpability of Mr Reynolds arose out of conduct that was different in detail from that of Mr Small. Thus, Mr Reynolds was culpable for putting Mr Small at the helm, when he ought to have known that he was unfit to control it and, having done so, neither supervised Mr Small nor discharged his own obligation as skipper of the workboat to keep a proper watch. Mr Small's culpability sprang from his patent inability to helm the workboat safely, by reason of his prior ingestion of intoxicating liquor and drugs. Recognising those differences in the foundation for culpability and the different statutory prescriptions for the respective offences, his Honour concluded that it was appropriate that the sentences for Mr Reynolds and Mr Small should be the same. 

The Appeal

31On 5 December 2012, Mr Small lodged a notice of appeal and notice of application for leave to appeal against sentence. Since they were filed out of time, he also filed notice of application for extension of time for notice of appeal and notice of application for leave to appeal. The extension was not opposed by the Crown and, on the hearing of the appeal and the application for leave on 21 June 2013, the Court granted the extension of time.

32The ground of appeal against conviction is that the trial judge erred in directing the jury that the term navigate for the purpose of s 52B of the Crimes Act meant merely controlling the helm of the workboat at the time of impact. The ground of the proposed appeal against sentence is that the sentencing judge erred in imposing the same sentence upon Mr Small as he imposed upon the co-offender, Mr Reynolds. 

Conviction

33Mr Small contended that mere physical control of the helm of the workboat did not constitute navigating the vessel within the meaning of s 52B of the Crimes Act. He submitted that, in order to be navigating a vessel for the purposes of s 52B, a person must have the management and control of the vessel or the effective control of the vessel. He asserted that it was Mr Reynolds, as master or skipper of the workboat, who was navigating the vessel at the relevant time, rather than Mr Small. 

34The words navigate and navigation are not defined in the Crimes Act. The word navigation is capable of wide meaning. In several maritime contexts, a distinction is drawn between care of cargo, on the one hand, and navigation or management of ships, on the other hand (see article IV of The Hague Rules and the The Hague-Visby Rules). 

35The meaning of the word navigate has been the subject of several decisions in a variety of statutory settings. For example, the word may include the sailing, steering, directing or managing of a vessel (Frost v Warner [2002] HCA 1; (2002) 209 CLR 509 at [31]). Further, the word is apt to encompass, if the context permits, the controlled movement of a ship to berth with the assistance of tugs (see Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship ""Global Peace"" [2006] FCA 954; (2006) 154 FCR 439 at [104] and the authority there cited). 

36As a matter of ordinary English, the word navigate, when used transitively in relation to a vessel, means to sail, direct or manage the vessel (Oxford English Dictionary) or to direct or manage the vessel on its course (Macquarie Dictionary). The etymology of the word is the Latin verb navigare. The etymology of navigare is a combination of the noun navis, meaning a ship, with agere, meaning, relevantly, to guide and govern or to drive forwards. Little assistance is gained from the etymology. 

37Mr Small contends that, absent express legislative definition to the contrary, it is not permissible merely to equate the concept of navigation of a vessel with the concept of driving a vehicle. That contention is advanced in the context of s 52A of the Crimes Act. Section 52A relevantly provides that a person is guilty of the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death if a vehicle driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning the death of another person, and the driver was, at the time of the impact, driving the vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or of a drug. 

38Mr Small contends that, in order to be guilty of an offence under s 52B, a person must be directing the course of the vessel at the relevant time, and it is not sufficient merely to be steering the vessel or having the mere physical control of the helm. He says that that construction follows from the rule that a criminal statute, if ambiguous or doubtful, should be construed strictly in favour of an accused person. He says that it would have been open for the Parliament, had it intended liability for an offence contrary to s 52B to attach to a person who was merely controlling the helm of a vessel, to have defined the term navigation to include such an activity in express terms. He says that the fact that it was not so defined indicates that the ordinary English definition of the term navigate was intended to apply. 

39However, the ordinary meaning of the word navigate, as including to direct a vessel, is consistent with steering the vessel. As indicated above, navigating can include steering, albeit that the word may include other activities in relation to a vessel. As a matter of ordinary English, there is no basis for concluding that navigating a vessel such as the workboat would not include being in control of the helm and thereby being in a position to direct the course to be taken by the vessel and to direct the direction in which it will travel. 

40I consider that, as a matter of ordinary English, Mr Small, in the circumstances described above, was navigating the workboat at the time of its collision with the trawler. He was the only one that could have taken action to avoid the collision, had he seen the fishing trawler soon enough. The fact that he did not see it is consistent only with his not keeping a proper lookout. He said that his vision to the port side of the workboat was obscured by the presence of Mr Reynolds, who was standing between the two seats. That, however, does not bear on the question of who was controlling the direction of the workboat at the time of the impact. There was no error on the part of the trial judge in the direction that his Honour gave to the jury and for his Honour's reasons for declining to direct a verdict for Mr Small. 

41If there were ambiguity as to the meaning of ""navigate"" in s 52B, the ambiguity would be dissipated by comparison with s 52A. It was clearly the intention of the Parliament to replicate in s 52B the provisions relating to culpable or dangerous driving of motor vehicles in s 52A. In his speech on the second reading of the Bill for the Act that inserted s 52B in its original form, the relevant Minister observed that, in recent times, it had become clear that injuries and deaths caused by the culpable navigation of boats, particularly speedboats, ought to be covered by an offence similar to the law relating to culpable driving of motor vehicles. The Minister said that the proposed s 52B was drafted in terms adapted from the then form of s 52A, with appropriate minor variations. The Minister said that similar penalties would apply to culpable navigation as were to apply to culpable driving (Hansard 30 March 1983, pp 5514 - 5515). 

42In 1996, the offence of culpable navigation in s 52B was amended to dangerous navigation, in line with similar amendments that had been made earlier to the offence of culpable driving. In his speech on the second reading of the Bill for that amendment, the relevant Minister observed that the offence of culpable navigation in s 52B was to be amended to make it consistent with the offence of dangerous driving provided for in s 52A. The Minister said that both sections contain the same maximum penalties and varied only as was necessary to reflect differences between driving on roads and navigating on waterways (Hansard 6 December 1995, p 4279). 

43It is clear enough that s 52B is directed at persons driving, steering or helming vessels. It may include other aspects of navigating, depending upon the circumstances of a particular case. However, there is no reason to confine the term navigation to the actions of the person with overall responsibility for the management of a vessel, to the exclusion of a person who is actually physically controlling the vessel.

44Mr Small sat in the starboard seat, took the helm and steered the workboat up to the time of the collision. It may be that he did so because Mr Reynolds invited him to do so. Nevertheless, he was exercising his own will in directing the course of the workboat. There was nothing to suggest that his actions were involuntary. I consider that he was navigating the workboat at the time of its impact. It follows that the appeal against conviction must be dismissed. 

Sentence

45Mr Small contended that Mr Reynolds' culpability was considerably greater than his. He asserted that he made ""a rather stupid error of judgment"", consequent upon his intoxication and drug-affectedness. He contended he had no boating experience and therefore no responsibility for either the workboat or the passengers on it. Mr Reynolds, on the other hand, he said, was the master of the workboat, was intoxicated, permitted the workboat to be overloaded, permitted Mr Small, an unlicensed, inexperienced, intoxicated and drug-affected person, to take the helm, failed to assist Mr Small in keeping a proper lookout and at times hindered his ability to keep a proper lookout. Mr Small says that, in those circumstances, Mr Reynolds was grossly negligent in nearly every action he took that night and that the respective sentences imposed upon them left Mr Small with a justifiable sense of grievance. 

46The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences must be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the relevant principle does not involve a judgment about the subjective feelings of a person complaining of disparity. The Court will not intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders, such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part that each had played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise. However, in deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity, the Court must have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required in drawing distinctions between co-offenders. Where there is a marked disparity between sentences giving rise to the appearance of injustice, there will be a basis for intervention notwithstanding that the sentence is not otherwise excessive (Green v Regina [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [31] - [32]). 

47Mr Small contends that the culpability of Mr Reynolds extended beyond the facts identified by the sentencing judge. He contends that Mr Reynolds culpability was considerably greater than that of his own.

48The charges upon which Mr Reynolds was convicted certainly carried a higher maximum penalty than those upon which Mr Small was convicted. That was not overlooked by the sentencing judge, who expressly noted the differences. However, his Honour also observed that the range for manslaughter offences, in terms of facts and objective seriousness, is great. Accordingly, the sentencing range is also great. 

49The Crown case was presented on the basis that the collision was caused by the combined acts and omissions of each of Mr Reynolds and Mr Small. Having regard to the convictions, it is fair to conclude that the jury found, as a fact, that the collision was caused by their combined acts and omissions. For that reason, it is not inappropriate for them to be treated equally in terms of culpability. The abandonment of responsibility by Mr Reynolds was equalled by the high level of irresponsible behaviour on the part of Mr Small, in taking the helm knowing his state of intoxication and impairment. 

50Neither Mr Reynolds nor Mr Small pleaded guilty and no significant difference in their subjective cases was put forward by either of them to justify a divergence in sentences. His Honour found that both had good prospects of rehabilitation and were unlikely to re-offend and found special circumstances in respect of each of them. His Honour took into account the importance of general deterrence in respect of the sentence to be imposed on each of them. His Honour also recognised the need to impose sentences that took into account the separate offences and number of victims and to apply the totality principle to the total effective sentence imposed on each. In circumstances where exactly the same sentence has been imposed on both offenders for what was effectively their joint culpability for an offence that resulted in the death of six victims, there is no basis for a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of Mr Small. In the circumstances, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the same sentence was warranted. 

Conclusion

51The appeal against conviction should be dismissed. Application for leave to appeal from the sentence should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed. 

52RA HULME J: I agree with Emmett JA. 

53RS HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Emmett JA and with his Honour's reasons.

		16 July 2013",2013-07-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2419897,R v John Francis Peterson [2013] NSWSC 1002,"Judgment
1Before the court is an enquiry pursuant to the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Procedures) Act 1990, (""the Act"") as to the fitness of the accused, John Francis Peterson, to stand trial on a charge that on or about 31st of May 2012, at Lethbridge Park in the State of New South Wales, he did murder Rafik Makaradi. 

2Tendered before the court today was an agreed bundle of documents which became exhibit A on the enquiry. That material was provided to me in advance of today's hearing, and accordingly I had the opportunity to read it in its entirety before today. 

3I have also read, in their entirety, the helpful submissions provided on behalf of the accused by Mr Smith of counsel who appears today. Counsel for the Crown has indicated he has read those submissions and that he has nothing further to add. The parties approached the matter on the basis that there is no necessity for the cross-examination of any of the medical practitioners who provided reports which are contained in exhibit A. 

4Both parties have submitted to me that on the basis of the evidence which has been tendered before me I should make orders, amongst other things, referring the accused to the Mental Health Tribunal pursuant to s14 of the Act.

5I should at this stage record my appreciation to both the Crown and the representatives of the accused for the practical manner in which the matter has been approached. That approach has been an expedient and sensible one, and has saved a great deal of court time. 

6Contained within exhibit A is a Crown case statement. I do not propose, for present purposes, to recount the contents of that statement. It forms part of the evidence before me and sets out, in some detail, the circumstances in which the Crown allege that the accused murdered Mr Makaradi. None of that material, of course, has been tested in any way but in any event, the issue for present purposes concerns the fitness of the accused to stand trial. 

7Pursuant to s10(2) of the Act, I must not conduct an enquiry into the question of the accused's fitness to be tried for an offence unless the question has been raised in good faith. Having read the material contained in exhibit A, and having read, in particular, the medical evidence contained within that exhibit, I am satisfied that the question of the fitness of the accused to be tried has been raised in good faith. 

8Pursuant to s6 of the Act, the issue of the accused's fitness is to be determined on the balance of probabilities. Under s12(3), there is no onus cast on either party in that respect. 

9In terms of the principles to be applied in determining the fitness of an accused to stand trial, the seminal authority remains the decision of Smith J in The Queen v Presser (1958) VR 45 where Smith J said (at p 48):

""(An accused) needs, I think, to be able to understand what he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceedings, namely, that it is an enquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all of the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand, I think, the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him, and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel, he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence, but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to detail what defence he will rely on and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the Court and to his counsel, if any.""

10That passage has been cited and approved on a number of occasions, including in Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230, where an additional refinement to the principles was added, namely, that in considering the factors referred to in Presser, the court should have regard to the length of the trial, given that the accused's fitness may vary from time to time throughout the trial. 

11With those principles in mind, I turn to consider the medical evidence which has been placed before me and which is contained in exhibit A. 

12Dr Ilana Hepner, a Clinical Neuropsychologist, provided a report to the accused's solicitor of 14 December 2012. In the course of that report, Dr Hepner (at paragraph 11) considered, by specific reference to each of the criteria set out by Smith J in Presser, the question of the accused's fitness to stand trial. Dr Hepner addressed, in specific terms, each of the criteria before arriving at the following opinion contained in paragraph 21.2:

""Mr Peterson is able to understand the charge against him. He demonstrates a basic understanding of the terms 'guilty' and 'not guilty' and the simple understanding of the possible consequences of being found guilty or not guilty. As such, I am of the opinion that he can understand the nature of the charges against him and he has the capacity to plead to a charge. He demonstrates a basic understanding of his right to challenge, however, he does not appear to understand the full legal complications of entering a plea and, in view of his performance on testing, it is uncertain as to whether he would be able to learn and remember this information adequately.""

13In succeeding paragraphs Dr Hepner went on to express the view that the accused did not demonstrate an adequate understanding of the nature of the proceedings. She also expressed significant concerns about his ability to follow the course of the proceedings, and concluded that on the basis of her interview with him, the accused did not demonstrate an understanding of any evidence against him. This led Dr Hepner to reach the conclusion that the accused did not understand the substantial effects of that evidence. 

14Dr Hepner went on to express the view that although the accused was able to provide an account of his version of events, there were significant concerns regarding his ability to instruct counsel, to make out his defence and to decide the material upon which his defence would rely. This led her to express, further concerns as to the accused's ability to make informed decisions for himself based on all of the relevant information. 

15Dr Hepner concluded, having considered each of the individual criteria in Presser, that the accused ""did not meet all the standards as identified...to participate in a trial"". 

16Dr Richard Furst, a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, provided a report to the accused's solicitor of 28 February 2013. For the purposes of providing his report, and aside from his interview with the accused, Dr Furst was provided with a copy of the brief of evidence against the accused, together with the report of Dr Hepner to which I have previously referred. 

17At page 7 of his report, Dr Furst addressed the issue of the accused's fitness. Unlike Dr Hepner, Dr Furst did not separately address each of the individual criteria in Presser. However having read his report, I am satisfied that although such criteria were not addressed separately as Dr Hepner did, each was ultimately considered by Dr Furst. In considering those criteria, Dr Furst observed, amongst other things, that the accused did not know what it meant to enter a plea, and did not understand what ""evidence"" was. 

18Ultimately, at page 8 of his report, Dr Furst expressed the opinion that the accused was not fit to be tried and was not fit to plead. He also expressed the view that given his intellectual disability and given that such disability was an enduring condition, the accused was unlikely to become fit over the next 12 months. 

19Finally, Dr Stephen Allnutt, Forensic Psychiatrist, interviewed the accused on 22 March 2013 at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Dr Allnutt provided a report to the Crown dated 3 May 2013, which forms part of exhibit A. 

20Dr Allnutt addressed the question of the accused's fitness commencing at page 5 of his report. In Dr Allnutt's opinion the accused had the capacity to understand what he was charged with, however he expressed the view that the accused was compromised in his capacity to understand the general nature of the proceedings. 

21Dr Allnutt considered that the accused had the capacity to understand the effect of any evidence although, like Dr Furst, he observed that the accused had told him that he did not know what the term ""evidence"" meant. Dr Allnutt concluded the accused had the capacity to plead to the charge, but that he was compromised in his capacity to tell the court what his defence was. He observed, amongst other things, that obtaining information from the accused was difficult. 

22Dr Allnutt considered that with the assistance of counsel, the accused could ""probably"" exercise his right of challenge and could ""probably"" decide on what defence he wished to rely upon. However, he went on to express the view that the accused was compromised in his capacity to give instructions to his counsel at trial. He observed, amongst other things, that the accused had comprehension difficulties, difficulties with hearing, and problems with communication. This led Dr Allnutt to express the view that there was a real risk that the accused would not be able to adequately follow the proceedings. 

23Ultimately, and whilst acknowledging that the question of the accused's fitness was a difficult one, Dr Allnutt expressed the view that if the trial were uncomplicated and brief (i.e. extending over a period of one or two days) then with assistance and frequent breaks the accused might be regarded as fit to stand trial. This opinion was predicated on the assumption that during the course of any such trial it was regularly and satisfactorily clarified with the accused that he had understood events. 

24However, Dr Allnutt proceeded to express the following view:

""But in a complicated and/or lengthy trial, on balance, while I believe that on first impression he appears more impaired than he actually is, he would be regarded by me as unfit to stand trial and, given that he has an intellectual disability that will not recover over the next 12 months, it is unlikely that he would become fit in the next 12 months.""

25Dr Allnutt approached the formulation of his opinion in a manner similar to that of Dr Furst, in that he did not address the criteria in Presser individually. However having read his report, I am satisfied that he addressed those criteria to an adequate degree. 

26It might be said that there was some degree of equivocation, at least in some respects, in Dr Allnutt's opinion. Ultimately however, he expressed the view that the accused was unfit to stand trial. It might also be noted that to the extent that Dr Allnutt considered the accused may be fit this was based on the proposition that the trial would be a brief one, and would extend over a period of only one or two days. While I have not been provided with the Brief of Evidence upon which the Crown relied, I have read the Crown case statement. Having done so, it appears to me to be highly unlikely that a trial of this nature could ever be completed over a period of one or two days. Such a submission was made on behalf of the accused by his counsel and it was not one with which the Crown took any issue. 

27It follows that having regard to the opinions of Dr Hepner, Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt, and bearing in mind that their opinions are both consistent and unchallenged, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused is unfit to stand trial. 

28In those circumstances, I make the following orders:

(1)I refer the accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal pursuant to the provisions of s14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Procedures) Act 1990.

(2)I order the accused be remanded in custody until such time as effect is given to any determination made by the Mental Health Tribunal. 

(3)I direct the Registrar provide, to the Mental Health Review Tribunal, a copy of exhibit A which was tendered in these proceedings and which is before me today, together with a copy of my reasons.

		29 July 2013",2013-07-25 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2420078,RP v R [2013] NSWCCA 192,"Judgment

1Simpson J: I agree with Price J. 

2Price J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to two indictments and was sentenced by Armitage DCJ (the judge) on 6 February 2012. The first indictment contained a single count of Indecent Assault Female then under the age of 16 years contrary to the now repealed s 76 of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence, having been committed between 28 April 1978 and 29 April 1980 carried a maximum penalty of 6 years imprisonment. The judge was asked to take into account on sentence another offence contrary to s 76 of the Crimes Act that had been included on a Form 1. This offence had been committed between 1 October 1979 and 29 April 1980. Both offences involved the indecent assault of LS who was then about 11 years old. 

3The applicant was sentenced by the judge, taking into account the Form 1 matter, to a fixed term of imprisonment for one year to date from 7 January 2010 and to expire on 6 January 2011. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against this sentence. 

4The second indictment contained seven offences that were committed between 2002 and 2009 and involved the applicant's granddaughters SP and JM. The offences were two counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act, two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act, one count of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 years and 16 years contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act, one count of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act and one count of possession of child pornography contrary to s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act. The overall sentence imposed for the offences on the second indictment by the judge was 13 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years 6 months. The applicant does not complain about these sentences and his appeal is confined to the sentence imposed for the single count on the first indictment. 

5I should mention that the sentence for count 1 on the second indictment was backdated to commence from 7 July 2010. As a result, the effective sentence for the offence on the first indictment is one of 6 months. The overall effective sentence for the offences on the first and second indictments was a non-parole period of 10 years commencing 7 January 2010 and expiring 6 January 2020 with a balance of term of 4 years commencing 7 January 2020 and expiring 6 January 2024. The earliest date the applicant is eligible to be released on parole is 6 January 2020. 

6The facts of the offence on the first indictment concerned LS, the daughter of the half-sister of the applicant's wife. LS was at the time about 11 years of age and visited the applicant and his wife at their home. On an occasion when LS and applicant were alone in the house, the applicant took LS to the lounge room, obtained some cream and rubbed it into her face and upper chest area, using both hands for a couple of minutes. The applicant remained clothed at the time. 

7The matter on the Form 1 also took place when LS was 11 years old when she visited the applicant's house. On this occasion, the applicant took LS to the lounge room and rubbed some cream into her face and upper chest area for a couple of minutes. The applicant remained clothed at the time. 

8The applicant was born on 22 June 1949 and had no previous offences. The judge allowed a discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea of guilty to the offence on the first indictment of 12.5 per cent. Hence, the undiscounted starting point of the sentence was 14 months. 

Ground 1 

9In the first ground of appeal, the applicant asserts that the judge misdirected himself as to the objective seriousness of the offence (and an identical offence on a Form 1) in the first indictment in holding that they were not at, or near the lowest end of the criminality formerly covered by the provisions of s 76 Crimes Act. 

10The Crown submits that the applicant's counsel in the District Court made a concession that it was open to the judge to find that the offence on the first indictment (and Form 1) was not at the very bottom of the range. The Crown argues that the judge in his sentencing remarks referred to the exchange with the applicant's counsel and made findings that were clearly consistent with the discussion. The Crown contends that what was said by the judge reflects his view that while the offence was not at the very bottom of the range it was near the bottom.

11In order to appreciate the submissions of the parties it is necessary to refer to the sentencing proceedings of 3 February 2012. The following exchange took place between Mr Grogan, the Crown Prosecutor, and the judge (T03/02/12 T 29 L 6-12):

""Grogan: ...I expect my friend's going to put to your Honour that that is a very low echelon example of that offence and I don't - -

His Honour: I'll hear your submissions in due course. 

Grogan: Yes but when it comes to that you can accept from the Crown that I don't take any issue with that ...""

12Mr Watts, the applicant's counsel, drew the judge's attention to Nelson v R [2007] NSWCCA 221 where Latham J said at [17]: 

""In the absence of evidence of the sentencing practices prevailing in 1972 for offences under s 76, his Honour was to be guided by the maximum penalty, as an expression of the legislature's view of the gravity of such offences at that time, and by the nature of the conduct proscribed by the offence : R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 at 511 ; R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368 ; AJB v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 51. His Honour did not have regard to the latter consideration, namely, that offences under s 76 in 1972 were not confined to non-consensual touching of the breasts and external genitalia of a female over the age of 16 years. There was no extended definition of ""sexual intercourse"" that allowed for acts such as fellatio, cunnilingus or anal intercourse to be charged as ""rape"". Sexual assaults other than penile/vaginal intercourse came under the umbrella of ""indecent assault"". A very broad range of very serious conduct by male offenders against female victims could not be prosecuted under any other provision of the Crimes Act 1900 as it then stood.""

13Mr Watts put to the judge that the applicant's conduct in rubbing the cream on the face and chest of LS was ""at the absolute lowest end of the range of ... criminal conduct captured by that section at that time"" (T03/02/12 T 30 L 26-27). The following exchange then took place between the judge and Mr Watts (T03/02/12 T 30 L 33-45):

""His Honour: If I say to you that while it doesn't strike me as at the very bottom of the range it's near the bottom, would you disagree?

Watts: Certainly. You Honour no I wouldn't cavil with that your Honour, I wouldn't seek to be heard any further.

His Honour: I have of course read the victim impact statement and it's quite obvious that the conduct was very distressing to the victim and I don't leave that out of count by any means. 

Watts: Your Honour, in that regard our submission would be that it is the objective criminality of the offending that would be the primary consideration in ascertaining the appropriate sentence in relation to that offence..."" (italics added).

14During his remarks on sentence, the judge said (at ROS 25): 

""Mr Watts made written submissions which I hope to summarise equally briefly. He drew attention to Nelson v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 221 at [17] and said in that light, the rubbing of [the] cream on the face and chest of the victim, in relation to the offences in the first indictment, was at the lowest end of the criminality covered by the section. I have already said that I do not agree with that submission, but I think it was considerably less serious than criminality one often sees in offences of this type, although of course extremely distressing to the victim. Mr Watts did not disagree with that when I put it to him."" (italics added)

15What was said by the judge in the passage quoted in the previous paragraph, did not precisely accord with his discussion with Mr Watts but there is no reason to consider that his Honour no longer adhered to his characterisation of the offence being ""near the bottom"" of the range. The applicant does not submit that the characterisation of the offence being near the bottom of the range was not open to the judge on the circumstances of the offence before him. 

16I would dismiss Ground 1 of the appeal. 

Ground 2 and Ground 3 

17It is convenient to deal with Grounds 2 and 3 together. In Ground 2 the applicant asserts that the judge ""erred in principle in sentencing [him] for the offence referred to in the First Indictment (""the sentence"") and thereby sentenced [him] to a period of imprisonment in which the non-parole period was disproportionately long when compared to the offences which were covered by the provisions of section 76 of the Crimes Act,1900 at the time of this offending.""

18The principal complaint is that the judge gave inordinate weight to the contents of the victim impact statement such that his Honour's assessment of the criminality in the offence involved error. The applicant submits that the judge appears to have treated the content of the victim impact statement as sworn evidence before him, which would necessarily have involved the witness being subject to cross-examination. Another submission is that the statement contains what can be properly viewed as a severe reaction to two relatively minor indecent assaults on a young girl and should not have had ""a multiplier effect"" on the sentence. 

19The Crown submits that the victim impact statement was tendered without objection and no submission was made to the judge that he was unable to rely on it or take it into account. The Crown contends that in the exchange between Mr Watts and the judge that has been quoted at [13] above, Mr Watts acknowledged that whilst it was not a primary consideration, the contents of the statement were a relevant consideration for the judge to take into account on sentence. 

20In Ground 3 the applicant asserts that ""the Sentence imposed ... in all the circumstances [is] manifestly excessive."" In support of this ground the applicant relies upon the decision in Nelson. 

21As to the assertion of manifest excess, the Crown referred to the circumstances of the case being readily distinguishable from those in the case of Nelson. The Crown argues that the applicant was to be sentenced on the basis that this was not an isolated incident as evidenced by the offence on the Form 1 and a 12 month fixed term was not so far outside the range available that there must have been error. 

22In my opinion, there is little benefit in comparing the sentence imposed in Nelson with the present case as there are important matters of difference which the applicant acknowledged during the hearing of the appeal. The facts in Nelson concerned a single count of indecent assault contrary to s 76 upon a complainant who was, in 1972, 16 years of age. No offence was included on a Form 1. The maximum penalty for the offence at that time was 3 years imprisonment and a discount of 22 per cent was allowed for the utilitarian value of the plea. A sentence of 14 months imprisonment was quashed on appeal and the applicant was re-sentenced to a fixed term of 4 months imprisonment. 

23In any event, it has been often said that appellate intervention is not justified because a sentence is markedly different to sentences imposed in other cases: O'Kell v R [2013] NSWCCA 162. To establish that the sentence is manifestly excessive, the applicant must demonstrate that the sentence is manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357; [2005] HCA 25. Each case must be considered in the light of its own facts. No two cases are the same and there is no single correct sentence: Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57. 

24The applicant's submission on the use by the judge of the victim impact statement essentially asserts that the judge gave too much weight to its contents. Questions of weight are matters for the discretion of the sentencing judge and will not usually justify intervention upon appeal: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85. I am of the opinion, however, the weight that his Honour gave to the contents of the victim impact statement led to a sentence that was plainly unjust. 

25LS wrote in her victim impact statement of the effect of the applicant's offending on her. She stated that his abuse had impacted on every relationship throughout her life. Her ability to trust and communicate with others was destroyed. Her childhood memories had been stolen. Since her thoughts were consumed with the horror of the abuse, she was not able to function as a parent or a person. She would distance herself from everyone and at times was unable to connect with her sons. She hates having her photo taken and did not even want to be photographed at her wedding. She had never looked herself in the eyes because she hated what she saw because of the applicant. She had tried to kill herself at the age of 11 in the hope that his abuse would be stopped. She had wishes she would die so that she had no memory of what he did to her. She described living with the shame as unbearable. She could not count the amount of times she had sobbed when her thoughts were consumed with the pain he had inflicted upon her. She would hide under a blanket and cry uncontrollably whilst her children were playing. The pain never goes away and will be with her for the rest of her life. The applicant made her physically and emotionally sick. 

26In referring to the victim impact statement, the judge said (at ROS 4-5): 

""I interpolate that I have, as part of exhibit A - the crown bundle in relation to these offences - the victim impact statement from the victim, LS. I trust I shall be forgiven if for reasons of space and time I do not repeat these remarks but it is enough to say that I have read them and they show that despite what is on the scale of sexual offending less serious offending than was involved in many offences in the second indictment the victim has suffered profoundly as a result of what happened to her and has experienced psychological problems throughout her entire life as a result of it. She has my profound sympathy. (italics added).

27It is evident from the judge's discussions with Mr Watts and his sentencing remarks that the judge uncritically accepted LS's statement and considered the harm to be substantial. LS undoubtedly suffered harm, however, the contents of her statement went well beyond what might be regarded as the type of harm expected from the circumstances of the applicant's offending. 

28As the victim impact statement raised harm that was more deleterious than could generally be expected from the circumstances of the offence, the judge was obliged to approach the statement with caution. The harm that LS described was not supported by other evidence: In R v Berg (2004) 41 MVR 399; [2004] NSWCCA 300, Wood CJ at CL said at [48] - [49]:

""...I would sound a note of caution in relation to the proper approach to fact-finding concerning the impact of a crime upon other members of the community or, upon the victim. If that is to be achieved by way of victim impact statements, then an injustice may occur in relation to a person standing for sentence, in so far as the maker of the statement would not normally be available for cross-examination. 

I add that caution in support of the general proposition that extreme care needs to be taken by those who prosecute and defend these cases, and also by trial Judges in always ensuring that there is a proper evidentiary basis for any findings of fact which go towards aggravating or mitigating a sentence.""

29Although in the present case LS's victim impact statement was tendered without objection, Mr Watts put to the judge that the objective criminality of the offending was the primary consideration. This was a submission as to the weight that the judge would attribute to the content of the victim impact statement. This was not a case such as Ollis v R [2011] NSWCCA 155, where the victim impact statement was admitted into evidence without objection and no submissions were made that the statement should be limited or that less weight should be attributed to it. Furthermore, in Ollis, the jury had accepted the evidence of the victim and it was open to the sentencing judge to find, by reference to the victim impact statement, that the victim suffered harm that went beyond that which was expected. 

30In my view, the excessive weight that the judge placed upon the victim impact statement is reflected in the undiscounted starting point of 14 months imprisonment. The act of indecency for the principal offence and the matter on the Form 1 involved the rubbing of cream into the upper chest area of an 11 year-old girl. At the time of the commission of the offence, the applicant was about 29 years old and had no prior offences which was a mitigating factor. Although the similar offending in the Form 1 matter emphasised the additional need for personal deterrence and retribution, a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment went beyond the legitimate exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion. 

31I would uphold Grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal. 

32The considerations upon which the applicant is to be re-sentenced are disclosed from what I have written to this point. Taking into account the Form 1 matter, I would impose a fixed term of two months imprisonment. In keeping with the judge's approach to the principle of totality, the sentence for count 1 on the second indictment is to be partially accumulated by one month on the sentence for the offence on the first indictment. It will be necessary to adjust the commencement and expiration dates in each of the sentences on the second indictment. As a result the total term of the overall sentence imposed for the offences on the first and second indictment will be 13 years 7 months with a non-parole period of 9 years 7 months. 





Orders

33I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal granted. 

2. Appeal allowed 

3. The sentence imposed by Armitage DCJ on 6 February 2012 for the single count on the first indictment is quashed. 

4. In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to two months imprisonment commencing 7 January 2010 and expiring 6 March 2010.

5. Adjust the commencement and expiration dates for the sentences imposed by Armitage DCJ on 6 February 2012 for the seven offences on the second indictment as follows:

(i) Count 1: a fixed term of 2 years commencing 7 February 2010 and expiring 6 February 2012. 

(ii) Count 2: a fixed term of 4 years commencing 7 August 2010 and expiring 6 August 2014.

(iii) Count 5: a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 7 February 2011 and expiring 6 February 2014 with a balance of term of 2 years commencing 7 February 2014 and expiring 6 February 2016.

(iv) Count 7: a non-parole period of 4 years commencing 7 August 2011 and expiring 6 August 2015 with a balance of term of 2 years commencing 7 August 2015 and expiring 6 August 2017.

(v) Count 3: a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 7 February 2012 and expiring 6 February 2017 with a balance of term of 3 years commencing 7 February 2017 and expiring 6 February 2020.

(vi) Count 4: a non-parole period of 6 years commencing 7 August 2012 and expiring 6 August 2018 with a balance of term of 4 years commencing 7 August 2018 and expiring 6 August 2022. 

(viii) Count 6: a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months commencing 7 February 2013 and expiring 6 August 2019 with a balance of term of 4 years commencing 7 August 2019 and expiring 6 August 2023. 

The earliest date the applicant is eligible for release to parole is 6 August 2019.

		11 September 2013",2013-08-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2420137,Hallworth v R [2013] NSWDC 286,"Judgment

1This is a case about a relationship which fell apart and which led to some very acrimonious exchanges. One of the parties found that she had to take out an apprehended domestic violence order against the other. The other then found that he not only breached that domestic violence order but he extended the acrimony beyond words to assaults. 

2The case is a sentence appeal by Bradley Hallworth. He was in a relationship with Edith Hallworth from the early 1990s. They have one daughter. Mr Hallworth significantly had no criminal convictions at all until he was 35 and then he had a driving offence. But coinciding with the breakdown of the relationship with Edith Hallworth he spiralled out of control over a period of about 12 months and got himself into a lot of trouble by assaulting Edith Hallworth and by breaching the apprehended domestic violence order which she had to take out against him. He ended up regularly in the Local Court. 

3When the relationship broke up it was accompanied by Bradley Hallworth being charged with assault. He got a good behaviour bond for that assault but then a year later he assaulted Edith Hallworth again and therefore contravened the order. The Local Court again gave him leniency by imposing a prison sentence but ordering that it be suspended. But then he got into further trouble a couple of months later when he assaulted his former partner yet again, this time twice. So those assaults were further contraventions of the apprehended violence order and, again, he came back to court. This time of course he had the suspended sentence which he had obviously breached. That was converted into a gaol term and, in addition. he received three gaol terms for the fresh offences. All this is set out in exhibit A which is the severity appeal instruction sheet tendered by the prosecution in Mr Hallworth's appeal against the sentences imposed by magistrates.

4The specifics about the offences and sentences are these. On 5 January 2013 Mr Hallworth committed a common assault which is an offence against s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). For that the magistrate imposed a sentence of 18 months on him with a non-parole period of 6 months. At the same time, for contravening a restriction in an apprehended domestic violence order - which is an offence against s 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW) - the magistrate imposed another sentence of 18 months. (Both of those were wrong because the earlier sentences - which had been suspended - were each 9 months. Mr Hallworth should have received at the most two sentences of 9 months.) 

5The magistrate was also dealing with Mr Hallworth for other events which occurred on 31 March 2013. Again there was a common assault and again there were breaches of the restrictions in an apprehended domestic violence order. There were two of those. The magistrate imposed sentences of 18 months for each. The magistrate dated those from 7 May 2013 and dated the earlier sentences from 31 March 2013. 

6When the matter first came before me, now about six weeks ago on 17 July 2013, Mr Hallworth was unrepresented. He could no longer afford legal representation. It became apparent that there may be an issue about the factual basis of his plea in the Local Court being in issue. (If I have not mentioned it, he pleaded guilty to all of the offences.) He was also in custody serving his sentences. He tendered a document which was consistent with there being an issue about the factual basis of one of his pleas. That became exhibit 2. My associate got in touch with the New South Wales Bar Association and asked whether it would provide pro bono assistance. Helpfully - and I acknowledge this help provided by the Bar Association - it did provide assistance by making available counsel on a pro bono basis. I have been ably assisted by Mr L M Crepaldi who has appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, the respondent to the appeal, throughout the case and by Ms S Haddad who stepped in as the pro bono counsel provided by the Bar Association. 

7The conduct of the case has been somewhat tortuous. That, as Mr Crepaldi said to me this afternoon, was because Mr Hallworth disputed the factual basis of some of the allegations and also asserted that his former partner had provoked some of the behaviour. There was a good deal of uncertainty about just what he was saying or acknowledging he did. 

8When a person appeals from the sentences imposed by a magistrate the District Court judge looks at the papers which were before the magistrate and any exhibits and also looks at any fresh evidence which is called before the judge. In this case I have had a good deal of fresh evidence in the form of exhibits and in the form of witnesses. I have heard evidence from Mr Hallworth himself, from his girlfriend, from his mother and from his former partner. 

9The factual dispute mainly focuses on what happened on 5 January 2013 to give rise to the two charges of common assault and contravening a restriction in a domestic violence order. I accept Mr Crepaldi's submission regarding this. Mr Hallworth did plead guilty originally to those facts. But not only that, the exchange of text messages which appeared in exhibit E is consistent with Ms Hallworth's account of the kinds of threats which were made against her by Mr Hallworth. The facts record that he said ""I am going to smash your head into the concrete when we leave here"" and ""You get back here and take me home or else I'm going to kill you. I will cut you up and gut you. I am going to go home and get my truck and run it into your house. I have a key to your home and I will come and get you."" It is also asserted that when Ms Hallworth was leaving the restaurant Mr Hallworth grabbed the back of her shirt and pulled her back in the door. Ms Edith Hallworth confirmed that in the evidence which she gave today. That and the language directed at her, as Mr Crepaldi says, I accept as constituting the common assault. The contravention of the restriction in the apprehended domestic violence order was the very fact that they were together.

10I regard the assault as fairly serious. He put his hand on the victim and was violent towards her in a public place and used vicious threats against her. I do not regard the contravention of the terms of the apprehended domestic violence order as particularly serious because he and Edith Hallworth came together by agreement although she may have been a little reluctant in the first place. Nevertheless, she acknowledged in evidence today that they often saw each other despite the terms of the agreement. I can understand why the magistrate imposed a sentence of imprisonment of 9 months in respect of those offences. Unfortunately, by oversight the later magistrate converted that to 18 months which cannot of course be done. The sentences imposed were 9 months and all the magistrate was doing on the second occasion was removing the suspension. 

11The magistrate in withdrawing the suspension and imposing the 18 months sentence imposed a non-parole period of 6 months. I propose to impose a non-parole period of 3 months because it bears the same relationship to the overall sentence, namely, one-third. 

12I turn now to the offences which were committed on 31 March 2013. These occurred at a club. The common assault was that during an argument Mr Hallworth threw the contents of his beer glass over Edith Hallworth. There was some confusion about whether the brim of the glass came in contact with her but Edith Hallworth frankly acknowledged and Mr Crepaldi fairly conceded that that did not occur. But nevertheless it was an assault in a public place where a drunken Mr Hallworth threw beer over his former partner. 

13I myself do not regard a sentence of 18 months as appropriate but because of what Mr Crepaldi points out, namely that Mr Hallworth already had a record and was on conditional liberty and had been afforded the benefit of a suspended sentence, there is no other option than a prison sentence in my opinion. I would regard an appropriate prison sentence as one of 12 months imprisonment. I would date that sentence from 31 March 2013.

14The two offences of contravening a restriction in an apprehended domestic violence order are comprised by the behaviour of Mr Hallworth going up to his former partner and saying ""You Fuck off out of here"" on one occasion and the other offence by him coming up to her and saying, ""I want to talk to you"". In the context of them seeing one another reasonably regularly and this being in a public place I do not regard those as very serious breaches at all and I propose to impose sentences of 1 month in respect of each of them. 

15I propose to fix a non-parole period of 5 months in respect of the 12 month sentence. There are special circumstances for not fixing the standard ratio which would be 9 months because Mr Hallworth needs to spend time getting his life and his business back into order. 

16Accordingly, the formal orders which I make in these appeals are these.

17In respect of the two offences committed on 5 January 2013, under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) I determine these appeals against sentence by setting aside the sentences. Instead of those sentences, in respect of each offence I impose a sentence of 9 months imprisonment. It will date from 31 March 2013 and expire on 30 December 2013. There will be a non-parole period of 3 months in each case commencing 31 March 2013 and expiring on 30 June 2013. 

18In respect of the contravene restriction in apprehended domestic violence order which is represented in exhibit A by the reference H51118821/1 - I should say in respect of all those three appeals, under s 20 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act I set aside those sentences. In respect of the matter I have just mentioned - 821/1 - I fix a sentence of 1 month's imprisonment to date from 31 March 2013 and to expire on 30 April 2013. 

19In respect of the other contravene restriction in apprehended domestic violence order - the one with the number H51118821/3 - I fix a sentence of 1 month's imprisonment commencing on 1 April 2013 and expiring on 30 April 2013. 

20In respect of the common assault I fix a sentence of imprisonment of 12 months commencing 31 March 2013 and expiring on 30 April 2014. I fix a non-parole period of 5 months to commence 31 March 2013 and to expire on 30 August 2013. Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in respect of that last sentence I make an order directing the release of Mr Hallworth on parole today, 30 August 2013.

		21 March 2014",2013-09-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2420312,Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2013] NSWSC 1428,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  This is an application for a forfeiture order pursuant to section 49 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (""the Act"").  It concerns funds which were in a bank account that have previously been made the subject of a restraining order.
2An affidavit sworn by Federal Agent Pierre Spano dated 23 November 2012 informs me as follows.  
3An account was opened with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in a false name, Janet Amiria Askin, by the use of a false New Zealand passport.  Opening and operating an account in a false name constitutes offences against s 24 of the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 (Cth). 
4The belief of Federal Agent Spano was that he suspected that a Susan Fisk, whose whereabouts were then unknown, fraudulently obtained a New Zealand passport by assuming the identity of a deceased infant named Janet Amiria Askin and that she used that passport to open and operate the account (and also for international travel). 
5The material exhibited to the affidavit includes that a Janet Amiria Askin was born in New Zealand on 9 April 1953 but died some five weeks later on 18 May 1953.  That information is derived from New Zealand Births Deaths and Marriages records. 
6On 5 February 1986, an application was made for a New Zealand passport in the name of Janet Amiria Askin.  It was supported by a birth certificate in that name showing the date of birth of 9 April 1953 as well as two passport photographs.  A Mr Horst Baltes certified one of those photographs as being a true likeness of Janet Amiria Askin.  The passport was issued in that name on 27 February 1986.
7Documents obtained from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia by the Australian Federal Police showed that the account was opened on 4 April 1990.  The false New Zealand passport was used as an identification document.  The amount of $162,374.05 stood to the credit of the account as at 2 April 2004.  There were subsequent deposits and withdrawals but there had been no activity on the account since 18 October 2007. As at 20 September 2012 the balance of the account was $160,729.25. 
8The affidavit includes reference to other matters not presently relevant, but it does include information to the effect that the whereabouts of Janet Amiria Askin was then unknown.  It also includes that the deponent believed that the true name of the person who purported to be Janet Amiria Askin was Susan Fisk, a person born in around 1942 in the United States of America. 
9An application for a restraining order was made to Simpson J on 26 November 2012.  On 27 November 2012, her Honour made orders including a restraining order pursuant to s 19 of the Act and an order pursuant to s 38 that the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy take custody and control of the funds in the account: The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2012] NSWSC 1533. 
10Her Honour was concerned amongst other things with a necessary question as to whether Federal Agent Spano had reasonable grounds for his suspicion that the funds standing to the credit of the account were ""proceeds of an indictable offence"" (s 19(1)(d)(i)).  Her Honour referred to Studman v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2007] NSWCA 285; (2007) 177 A Crim R 34.  Her Honour concluded that she was not satisfied that there were reasonable grounds to conclude that the funds in the account were proceeds of crime.  However, her Honour was satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for a suspicion that they were an ""instrument of serious offence"" (s 19(1)(e)(ii)) and accordingly made the orders that were sought. 
11Certain matters set out in the legislation about the making of a forfeiture order need be noted.  First, an application for such an order may be made by a ""proceeds of crime authority"":  s 59.  The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police is such an authority:  definition in the dictionary in s 338.
12The power of the Court to make a forfeiture order relied upon by the Commissioner was that found in s 49:
Forfeiture orders--property suspected of being proceeds of indictable offences etc.
(1)  A court with proceeds jurisdiction must make an order that property specified in the order is forfeited to the Commonwealth if:
(a)  the responsible authority for a restraining order under section 19 that covers the property applies for an order under this subsection; and
(b)  the restraining order has been in force for at least 6 months; and
(c)  the court is satisfied that one or more of the following applies:
(i)  the property is proceeds of one or more indictable offences;
(ii)  the property is proceeds of one or more foreign indictable offences;
(iii)  the property is proceeds of one or more indictable offences of Commonwealth concern;
(iv)  the property is an instrument of one or more serious offences; and
(e)  the court is satisfied that the authority has taken reasonable steps to identify and notify persons with an interest in the property.
(2)  A finding of the court for the purposes of paragraph (1)(c):
(a)  need not be based on a finding that a particular person committed any offence; and
(b)  need not be based on a finding as to the commission of a particular offence, and can be based on a finding that some offence or other of a kind referred to in paragraph (1)(c) was committed.
(3)  Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply if the court is satisfied that:
(a)  no application has been made under Division 3 of Part 2-1 for the property to be excluded from the restraining order; or
(b)  any such application that has been made has been withdrawn.
(4)  Despite subsection (1), the court may refuse to make an order under that subsection relating to property that the court is satisfied:
(a)  is an instrument of a serious offence other than a terrorism offence; and
(b)  is not proceeds of an offence;
if the court is satisfied that it is not in the public interest to make the order.
13The matters in s 49(1)(a) and (b) are clearly established.  The matter in s 49(1)(c) may be disregarded because it does not apply: s 49(3).  
14As to the matter in s 49(1)(e), Mr McCarthy, counsel for the plaintiff, has candidly conceded that there may be an issue and that if I was not satisfied that reasonable steps had been taken, I could make directions as to further steps that should be taken.  However, having regard to the material in the further affidavit of Federal Agent Spano of 23 September 2013, I am satisfied that this requirement has been satisfied as well.  In this regard I have taken particular note of the fact that there has been no activity on the account since October 2007 and that officers of the bank have reported that no-one (apart from the Australian Federal Police) has even made an inquiry about the account.  I am satisfied that all reasonable steps to locate the person who is thought to have opened and operated the account have been taken.
15There is a question as to the construction of s 49(4).  On one view, it may be that the Court could refrain from determining the issues posed in paragraphs (a) and (b), thereby denying itself a discretionary basis for refusing to make the order.  An alternative view is that the Court is required to consider the matters in those paragraphs and then consider whether the discretion is enlivened.  
16In my view, based on what was said in Studman and also what I said in Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Mulder [2013] NSWSC 993, that it is clearly the case that the funds which stood at credit in the bank account in question were the instrument of a serious offence.  Further, there is no basis to think that they were an instrument of a terrorism offence. 
17As to the question of whether the funds standing to the credit of the account were ""proceeds of an offence"", Studman supports the view that they were, whereas the reasoning of Simpson J in The Commissioner for the Australian Federal Police suggests otherwise. 
18However, in the circumstances of the present application, I do not need to concern myself with this issue of statutory construction.  And it is preferable that I do not express any concluded view because there is no contradictor.  If I am satisfied that the funds in the account were the proceeds of an offence, I would not have the discretion in s 49(4) to refrain from making the order.  If I was satisfied that they were not the proceeds of an offence, I would then have to consider whether it is not in the public interest to make the order. And there is no basis that I can see for my being satisfied that it is not in the public interest to make the order.  Accordingly, whatever view I take of the ""proceeds of offence"" issue, the result is the same. 
19Given my satisfaction of the matters in s 49(1), I propose to make the orders sought. 
Orders
1.  Pursuant to section 49 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) the Court orders that the property specified in the Schedule, less costs and expenses owing to the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy be forfeited to the Commonwealth;
2.  Pursuant to section 58 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) the Commonwealth Bank of Australia is ordered to transfer to the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy any funds remaining in Commonwealth Bank of Australia account number 51xx xxxxx89 within 7 days of the date of this order;
3. Pursuant to section 69 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) the Commonwealth have leave to deal with the property immediately;
4.  There is no order as to costs;
5.  Liberty to apply.
SCHEDULE
The sum of funds standing to the credit of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia account number 51xx xxxxx89 restrained pursuant to section 19 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) on 27 November 2012 and taken into the Custody and Control of the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy pursuant to section 38 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth).

2420377,R v Yin [2013] NSWDC 234,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: In July this year I sentenced Lang Shuo Zheng for an offence involving an attempt to possess a large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine.

2The offender standing for sentence today, Hao Yin, committed an offence in relation to that same quantity of pseudoephedrine together with another smaller quantity.

3As I said when sentencing Mr Zheng, manufacturers of methylamphetamine face a number of difficulties but one of the most important is sourcing their raw ingredients. This has made the importation of pseudoephedrine from overseas a highly desirable means of obtaining the precursors to methylamphetamine manufacture.

4The fact that in China there can be purchased a legitimate medication known as Contact NT which contains a relatively high proportion of pseudoephedrine has made importation of that drug from China a common source of the necessary precursor.

5The fact that it can be legitimately purchased in China also affects the moral culpability of those who are involved in the supply of that drug in New South Wales. There is clearly a tendency on the part of those who know that Contact NT can be bought legitimately in China to think that that substance is not truly as bad as it really is.

6Once more the statement of facts tendered by the Prosecution in this case is full of unnecessary detail, tending to obscure rather than illuminate the essential criminality of what the offender did. I have done my best and this is what I think is the situation.

7The offender was involved with Mr Zheng. Mr Zheng was the principal in the Australian arm of an operation whereby pseudoephedrine would be imported into Australia and then supplied to others. Mr Yin, the offender, assisted him. His role was to facilitate acceptance of the pseudoephedrine, to store the pseudoephedrine, to unpack it and repackage it at Mr Zheng's direction and to remit money overseas. The evidence would tend to suggest that in all of these activities, Mr Yin acted at the direction of Mr Zheng.

8I was not able to determine any occasion where the offender exercised any significant initiative. It does not appear that he made any independent decision in relation to anything important in this matter, simply doing what Mr Zheng told him.

9He has now pleaded guilty to one offence of supplying a prohibited drug, it related to two separate quantities of pseudoephedrine, one quantity, 27.58 kilograms corresponded with the quantity for which Mr Zheng was sentenced. (Mr Zheng pleaded guilty and was sentenced to an attempt to obtain possession of the drug, the attempt being because an inert substance had been substituted by the authorities).

10Mr Yin has pleaded guilty to supplying that drug, that being more than a large commercial quantity. Although the charges are legally different nothing actually turns on that difference, the maximum penalties are the same as is the standard nonparole period.

11It is a serious matter indeed, carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment to supply a large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs. It also carries with it a standard nonparole period of 15 years imprisonment, I have taken into account both the standard nonparole period and the maximum penalty in determining the appropriate sentence. My reasons for not imposing the standard nonparole period are to be found in these remarks on sentence.

12The offender was born in China. He is an only child because of the One China Policy. His father worked in a bank and his mother collected rent for the Housing Commission. I presume because they were keen to see their son succeed they sent him to Australia to study after he had completed Year 10 in China. At first he did English courses and then he went to High School but halfway through Year 12 he commenced doing a cooking and hospitality course at TAFE. He has been largely working in restaurants since then.

13Along the way he married a woman who he had met at school, Winona Chen, but that marriage ended. It is certainly over now that he has gone into custody. She has not visited him on any occasion. The breakdown of the marriage led to Mr Yin becoming depressed. He had a friend whom he looked up to, that friend was Mr Zheng, the gentlemen I sentenced earlier this year. As far as Mr Yin was concerned Mr Zheng had a lifestyle to be admired.

14After Mr Yin's marriage broke down, Mr Zheng was quite supportive both emotionally and financially, and so it was that when Mr Zheng asked Mr Yin to do him a favour and collect a package in 2009 Mr Yin agreed.

15The 27.58 kilograms I referred to earlier represented the contents of one of those packages but there is another quantity of pseudoephedrine I should mention which was discovered after Mr Yin was arrested. In his bedroom was another 909.6 grams of pseudoephedrine which was the product of an earlier delivery of another package. 

16This is the first offence of Mr Yin apart from a single shoplifting matter a few years ago. He is 26 years of age and has plans on his release from custody and presumed deportation to continue working in hospitality and restaurants.

17To get to the age of 24 without committing any criminal offence and then to commit an offence as serious as this does tend to suggest that there is a good prospect this will be the only offence, serious offence at least, Mr Yin ever commits, there are thus good prospects of rehabilitation.

18I am prepared to find that Mr Yin's involvement in this operation was the product of particular circumstances, flowing significantly from the depression he experienced after his marriage split up and the fact that he looked up to someone, Mr Zheng, who took advantage of him. He was impressionable and vulnerable to requests for help by Mr Zheng.

19He gave evidence in Court today expressing his remorse, not only because of the effects of his offence on his family but also because of the consequences that flow from the supply of drugs and their use by people in the community. I accept that Mr Yin is remorseful. It is fortunate that, at least insofar as the drugs that Mr Yin is charged with supplying, none of the pseudoephedrine ever made it to any drug manufacturer because of the intervention of the authorities.

20He has been in custody from 18 January 2012. He is serving his sentence away from his family, although fortunately for him, his mother has been able to visit him once a week for two months one year, and then once a week for three months the following year but of course he will do his time in custody harder than those offenders who receive more regular visits from family and friends.

21He is using his time in custody productively, continuing his English studies. He gave evidence today in English for the most part, requiring the assistance of the interpreter on only a few occasions such as when there was a reference to his ""residence"" rather than his ""home"" or ""house"".

22He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity it is conceded by the Crown and so he is entitled to a discount on his sentence of 25%.

23Of course one of the most important factors appropriately relied on by Mr Wilkinson as regards to the sentence that I should impose upon Mr Yin concerns the principle of parity. Mr Yin should not have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence I impose on him with the sentence I earlier imposed on Mr Zheng especially because Mr Yin's role was much less than that of Mr Zheng. 

24I have already explained that Mr Yin operated at the direction of Mr Zheng. Another way of comparing their roles is to examine why Mr Yin was doing this. His financial reward was at most $1,500 in relation to each of the two separate packages. Given the significant commercial value of the quantities of pseudoephedrine it can be appropriately said that Mr Yin's financial reward was meagre in the extreme, and so in objective terms, Mr Yin's conduct was much less serious than that of Mr Zheng.

25Pointing somewhat in the other direction, however, is the circumstance that Mr Yin's sentence covers two separate quantities, about a kilogram more than the quantity that Mr Zheng's sentence covered. Nevertheless, Mr Yin's sentence must in accordance with the principles of parity be less than that of Mr Zheng. It is unfortunate for Mr Yin, that it however remains the case, that he must be punished and significantly so for what he has done.

26His involvement in this most significant crime involving large quantities of a drug necessarily means that a sentence of some length be imposed upon him. Drugs are terrible things. The community suffers in many ways because of the actions of drug addicts and the authorities, including sentencing courts, must do what they can to deter others from acting as Mr Yin has acted.

27I impose sentence as follows: I sentence Mr Yin to imprisonment. I set a nonparole period of four years to date from 18 January 2012. It will expire on 17 January 2016. I set a head sentence of seven years. Mr Yin is eligible to be released to parole on 17 January 2016.

		05 December 2013",2013-10-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2420434,RS v R [2013] NSWCCA 227,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY P: I agree with Schmidt J.

2McCALLUM J: I agree with Schmidt J, for the reasons her Honour has stated. I would make the following additional remarks as to ground 1. As Schmidt J has explained, before the amendments to the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 which took effect from January 2006, the court lacked power to postpone the commencement date of a limiting term and therefore lacked power to give effect to a fundamental principle of sentencing. The amendments were intended to address that deficiency but not in such a way as to produce limiting terms which would be more onerous than the sentences which would have been passed after a normal trial. It was in that specific context that Parliament saw fit to remind the court of the need to bear in mind the normal mechanism for accumulation, which requires that consecutive sentences be fixed by reference to non-parole periods: see s 47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Absent that statutory reminder, since non-parole periods are not set in the case of forensic prisoners, the new process may have produced more onerous results for such prisoners through inadvertence. The principles of sentencing otherwise remain unqualified by the amendments. Specifically, there is no warrant for the conclusion, which appeared to be the premise of ground 1, that Parliament intended the aggregate limiting term for multiple offences to be less onerous than the aggregate head sentence imposed for multiple offences after a normal trial.

3Section 54(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act excludes forensic prisoners from the requirement in Division 1 of Part 4 of the Act to set a non-parole period for a sentence. It was no doubt in recognition of that provision that the learned sentencing judge stated that he had ignored the standard non-parole period (the relevant passage of the remarks on sentence is set out by Schmidt J). It is doubtful, however, whether the existence of a standard non-parole period is to be ignored altogether. As the High Court explained in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 at [27], a standard non-parole period is a legislative guidepost which stands among the full range of factors the court is obliged to take into account in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence after a normal trial. The standard non-parole periods Parliament has prescribed fall in Division 1A of Part 4, not Division 1. In any event, that was not the issue that arose in the present case.

4I agree with the orders proposed by Schmidt J.

5SCHMIDT J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of limiting terms imposed upon him under the provisions of s 23(1)(b) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. In 2011 the applicant was arrested and charged with thirteen offences involving two young complainants. In May 2012 the Mental Health Review Tribunal found him to be unfit to be tried on those charges. He was then granted conditional bail, having spent over 13 months in custody. 

6The Director of Public Prosecutions advised that it would proceed with the charges and so in December 2012 a special hearing was conducted in the District Court under s 19 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. 

7On 10 December 2012, Sides DCJ found under s 22(1)(c) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, that on the limited evidence available, the applicant had committed ten of the offences charged, they being offences under s 61O(2) and s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Six of those offences involved the first complainant. They occurred in July 2010. Four of the offences involved the second complainant. They occurred in February 2011. 

8Bail was revoked on 10 December. His Honour indicated that he considered that given the seriousness of his offending, the period the applicant had already spent in custody, then some 1 year, 1 month and 21 days, would not equate to an appropriate overall limiting term for the offences found proven.

9His Honour explained that he considered that bail should be refused even though the applicant had been assaulted while in custody before bail was granted and notwithstanding that because of his intellectual disability and separation from his family, who had been unable to visit him while he had previously been in custody, that custody would be more burdensome for him. 

10That conclusion rested on the adverse verdicts he had reached in relation to the offences committed against two different victims, one of whom was related to the applicant and the other being the daughter of a close friend. His Honour also had concerns, which he explained, as to the conduct of the applicant's siblings and mother on an occasion when he had breached the conditions of his bail, which required particular supervision when he was away from his home. He also had a concern as to the applicant's criminal record, what the protection of the community required and the capacity of the two people nominated to have responsibility for supervising him. His Honour recommended that the applicant be placed on protection. 

11The applicant then remained in custody bail refused until 8 February 2012, when he was sentenced and referred to the Mental Health Tribunal under s 24 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. After a hearing in May 2013, the applicant was transferred to Long Bay Hospital, by order of the Mental Health Review Tribunal.

12By 8 February the applicant had spent a further 1 month, 30 days in custody. In the result he had spent a total period in custody, bail refused, of 1 year, 3 months and 21 days, when sentenced. 

13The limiting terms imposed were partly cumulative, with the result that the total of the limiting terms imposed was 2 years, 3 months, that is some 11 months and 9 days in addition to the time the applicant had already spent in custody. Those imposed in respect of the offences involving victim 1 commenced on 5 April 2011 and concluded on 4 April 2012. Those imposed in respect of the offences involving victim 2 commenced on 28 October 2012 and will conclude on 27 January 2014. The individual terms imposed were: 

Victim 1

Count 1 (10 July 2010); count 3 (17 July 2010); and count 5 (18 July 2010):
Section 61O(2) - an act of indecency towards a person under the age of 10 years - maximum penalty 7 years - exposure of penis: 

Limiting terms of 1 month to commence on 5 April 2011 expiring 4 May 2011

Count 2 (10 July 2010)
Section 61M(2) - aggravated indecent assault of a person under the age of 16 years - maximum penalty 10 years - touched victim on her genitals (bare): 

Limiting term of 8 months to commence on 5 April 2011 expiring 4 December 2011

Count 4 (17 July 2010)
Section 61M(2) - touched victim on her genitals: 

Limiting term of 8 months to commence on 5 June 2011 expiring 4 February 2012

Count 6 (18 July 2010)
Section 61M(2) - touched victim on her genitals:

Limiting term of 8 months to commence on 5 August 2011 expiring 4 April 2012


Victim 2
Count 10 (13 February 2011)
Section 61M(2) - touched victim on her genitals:

Limiting term of 5 months to commence on 28 October 2012 expiring 27 March 2013

Count 11 (13 February 2011)
Section 61M(2) - forcing victim's hand onto his penis:

Limiting term of 8 months to commence on 11 November 2012 expiring 10 July 2013

Count 8 and count 9 (13 February 2011)
Section 61M(2) - 'simulated intercourse' and opening the victim's vagina with fingers and looking in, without actual penetration:

Limiting term of 14 months to commence on 28 November 2012 expiring 27 January 2014


14Two observations should immediately be made about these individual sentences. Firstly, both at first instance and on appeal, it was common ground that the maximum penalty for each s 61O offence was 10 years, when in fact the maximum penalty was 7 years. Given the nominal terms of 1 month imposed for each of these offences, (counts 1, 3 and 5), which were all made wholly concurrent with the term imposed for count 2, this error had no practical impact on the terms imposed on the applicant. That presumably explains why this error was not raised on appeal.

15Secondly, there was a hiatus period of some 6 months and 15 days between the terms imposed. The hiatus commenced on 4 April 2012, (when the limiting term for count 6, involving the first victim expired) and ended on 28 October 2012, (when the limiting term for count 10 involving the second victim commenced). 

16His Honour did not explain that hiatus in his sentencing judgment. It did not entirely reflect the time that the applicant was on bail, between 25 May 2012 and 10 December 2012, (of some 6 months and 5 days), but may have been intended to reflect that period. If so, his Honour appears to have made a miscalculation, to which it will be necessary to return.

Grounds of Appeal

17The applicant relied on six grounds of appeal:

""(1) The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account s23(6) Mental Health Forensic Provisions Act; 

(2) The sentencing judge erred in finding that the offender had engaged in simulated intercourse.

(3) The total limiting term imposed is unduly harsh and severe;

(4) The sentencing judge erred in failing to take or sufficiently take into account the mitigating factor under 21A(3)(j) that the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of the offender's mental disability;

(5) The sentencing judge erred in imposing a longer sentence based on protection of the community;

(6) The sentencing judge erred in failing to make any allowance for good character.""



Ground 1 - Failure to take account of s 23(6) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act

18The limiting terms imposed establish the period beyond which the applicant cannot be detained for the offences which were the subject of the special hearing (see R v Mitchell [1999] NSWCCA 120; (1999) 108 A Crim R 85 at [30]). A person serving such a limiting term is a forensic patient, who may only be discharged prior to the expiry of such a term under the six monthly review process established under Part 5 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act.

19In R v Mailes [2004] NSWCCA 394; (2004) 150 A Crim R 365, the object of imposing a limiting term on a person who has been found to be unfit to be tried was explained at [32]:

""The objects of sentencing a person who has been convicted of a crime following a trial are the punishment of such person and the other objects set out in s 3A of the CSP Act. The object of nominating a limiting term is not to punish the person who has not been convicted of any crime, but to ensure that he or she is not detained in custody longer than the maximum the person could have been detained if so convicted following a proper trial, although such person may be released prior to the expiration of such limiting term depending on the person's condition, or if such person becomes fit to be tried during such term, he or she can be tried according to law and if found guilty at such trial, can have a proper sentence fixed with a non-parole period. The maximum time that a person can be detained if convicted at a proper trial is the head or total sentence not the non-parole period: MHCP Act s 28 which sentence must take into account any time served under a limiting term.""


20Section 23 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act governs how such a limiting term is to be determined, by reference to the total sentence which would ordinarily be imposed for the offence, after a normal criminal trial. That exercise does not involve the setting of a non-parole period (see s 54(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). 

21By way of contrast, when a person is sentenced after a normal criminal trial, the sentencing judge is obliged to impose a non-parole period, that being 'the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence', under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In Mailes it was explained at [29] that as a matter of construction of these two Acts:
""There is, in my opinion, yet a further reason why the ""sentence"" referred to in s 23 must be a reference to the total sentence and not to the non-parole period. The only authority in the CSP Act for setting a non-parole period which is less than the total sentence is s 44 which is in Division 1 of Part 1 of the Act; but s 54 expressly provides that the Division does not apply to the sentencing of an offender to detention under the MHCP Act. A corresponding provision was formerly to be found in s 13(d) of the Sentencing Act, but it only provided that the relevant Part of the Act did not apply to detention under ss 25 or 39 of the MHCP Act, which relate to detention following a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness. The broader exclusion in the CSP Act is, in my view, significant and must have been intended to refer to all detention under the MHCP Act, including detention under ss 23, 24 and 27. Consequently, simply as a matter of construction, there is no statutory authority in the case of a limiting term for fixing a non-parole or equivalent period at less than the total term.""


22The case advanced for the applicant was that despite the provision made in s 23(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act and how it was construed in Mailes, the effect of s 23(6) is that properly construed, s 23 now requires that when a limiting term is fixed, the non parole period that would have been imposed, had the person been convicted after a normal criminal trial, is a relevant factor that must be taken into account by the Court, if a cumulative sentence is imposed in accordance with s 23(5)(b).

23Section 23 was amended after Mailes was decided. As from 1 January 2006, subsections (5) and (6) were introduced by the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 2005 (repealed). It now provides after further amendment in 2009, when subsection (7) was introduced by the Mental Health Legislation Amendment (Forensic Provisions) Act 2008 (repealed): 

""23 Procedure after completion of special hearing
(1) If, following a special hearing, it is found on the limited evidence available that an accused person committed the offence charged or some other offence available as an alternative, the Court:
(a) must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence which the person is found to have committed, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment, and
(b) where the Court would have imposed such a sentence, must nominate a term, in this section referred to as a limiting term, in respect of that offence, being the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence.
(2) If a Court indicates that it would not have imposed a sentence of imprisonment in respect of a person, the Court may impose any other penalty or make any other order it might have made on conviction of the person for the relevant offence in a normal trial of criminal proceedings.
(3) Any such other penalty imposed or order made, under subsection (2), is to be subject to appeal in the same manner as a penalty or order in a normal trial of criminal proceedings.
(4) In nominating a limiting term in respect of a person or imposing any other penalty or making any other order, the Court may, if it thinks fit, take into account the periods, if any, of the person's custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods related to the offence).
(5) A limiting term nominated in respect of a person takes effect from the time when it is nominated unless the Court:
(a) after taking into account the periods, if any, of the person's custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods related to the offence), directs that the term be taken to have commenced at an earlier time, or
(b) directs that the term commence at a later time so as to be served consecutively with (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively with) some other limiting term nominated in respect of the person or a sentence of imprisonment imposed on the person.
(6) When making a direction under subsection (5) (b), the Court is to take into account that:
(a) a sentence of imprisonment imposed in a normal trial of criminal proceedings may be subject to a non-parole period whereas a limiting term is not, and
(b) in a normal trial of criminal proceedings, consecutive sentences of imprisonment are to be imposed with regard to non-parole periods (as referred to in section 47 (4) and (5) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999).
(7) If the Court indicates that it would not have imposed a sentence of imprisonment in respect of a forensic patient, it must notify the Tribunal that a limiting term is not to be nominated in respect of the person.""


24Before these amendments, s 23(5) permitted a limiting term to commence at an earlier time, but a later commencement was not permitted. The 2006 amendments introduced the possibility of a limiting term with a later commencement being imposed. 

25In the Second Reading Speech the proposed amendments to s 23(5) and s 23(6) were explained:

""This amendment is directed towards dealing with a deficiency in the legislation highlighted in the judgment of Justice Giles in R v RTI [2005] New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal 337, in particular paragraph 45. The amendment gives effect to Justice Giles's suggestion that there should be a power to accumulate limiting terms. It is not intended that accumulation of limiting terms be dealt with in a way that is more onerous than the accumulation that takes place after a normal trial. The insertion of proposed section 23 (6) is intended to ensure that the court takes account of, and is guided as far as possible by, the provisions governing consecutive sentences after a normal trial. In all but the worst cases limiting terms where accumulation is warranted should
be partly concurrent and partly consecutive.""


26Giles JA observed in Regina v RTI [2005] NSWCCA 337 at [43] - [45]:

""43 Section 23(5) directs that the limiting term takes effect from the time when it is nominated. It and s 23(4) authorise only a back-dated commencement of a limiting term having regard to the periods of the person's custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing, being periods related to the offence. Further, as was pointed out in R v AN [2005] NSWCCA 239 at [14], s 23(5) does not authorise the commencement of a limiting term on a date after its imposition. Thus the Court can not nominate cumulative or partly cumulative limiting terms if commencement of some of the limiting terms would be after the time of nomination. 

44 In the present case a number of the limiting terms were backdated to commence at times prior to 15 October 2004. It is not clear why the first commencing date of 13 May 2002 was selected by the judge, although we were informed that the appellant had been in custody from that date and his Honour must have been so informed. However, the appellant was not charged with the offences presently in question until 4 July 2001, and his earlier custody had been related to other offences (see R v RTI, above). Some of the limiting terms were imposed to commence on dates after 15 October 2004, as a result of his Honour's consideration of cumulation. It does not appear that the significance of s 23(4) and (5) was drawn to his Honour's attention, and his sentencing miscarried as to the first commencing date and the limiting terms commencing after 15 October 2004. 

45 It is difficult to see that the legislature intended that the range of sentencing options available on a trial in accordance with normal procedures should not be available: s 23(1)(b) of the Act is to the contrary. Yet that is so when there are multiple offences calling for consideration of cumulation. There is a defect in the legislation, which deserves further attention.""


27In this case Sides DCJ initially referred to the requirements of s 23, correctly observing:

""As the Court is to indicate a limiting term, if of the view that a sentence of imprisonment would have been imposed after a normal trial, there is no provision for fixing a non-parole period and the Court ignored the standard non-parole period."" 



28His Honour later said that he intended the terms he imposed to ""reflect pre-sentence custody"". They all accordingly commenced before 8 February 2013, the date of sentencing, as s 23(5)(a) permitted. None commenced after 8 February, as s 23(5)(b) permitted. 

29If the sentences imposed had resulted in terms commencing ""at a later time so as to be served consecutively with (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively with) some other limiting term nominated"", then questions of accumulation and concurrency would have had to be considered, in the context of the provisions of s 47(4) and s 47(5) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. These provisions are directed to ensuring that there is no gap in custody, when a term of imprisonment is already being served. They provide:

""(4) The day specified in a direction under subsection (2) (b) must not be later than the day following the earliest day on which it appears (on the basis of the information currently available to the court) that the offender:
(a) will become entitled to be released from custody, or
(b) will become eligible to be released on parole,
having regard to any other sentence of imprisonment to which the offender is subject.

(5) A direction under subsection (2) (b) may not be made in relation to a sentence of imprisonment (or an aggregate sentence of imprisonment) imposed on an offender who is serving some other sentence of imprisonment by way of full-time detention if:
(a) a non-parole period has been set for that other sentence, and
(b) the non-parole period for that other sentence has expired, and
(c) the offender is still in custody under that other sentence."" 


30Section 47(2)(b) provides:

""(2) A court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment:

...

(b) commences on a day occurring after the day on which the sentence is imposed, but only if the sentence is to be served consecutively (or partly concurrently and partly consecutively) with some other sentence of imprisonment.""


31The applicant was not already serving a sentence for another offence and none of the terms which Sides DCJ imposed commenced after 8 February 2013. Accordingly, none of these considerations arose in this exercise. That did not, however, mean that questions of accumulation and concurrency did not have to be considered. 

32As discussed in R v AN [2005] NSWCA 239 at [13], in determining a limiting term 'the court is to adopt and apply all the principles of sentencing, whether arising under the common law or statue, that apply in sentencing a person convicted of the offence'. In a case of multiple offences, such as this case, that requires consideration to be given to the question of totality and whether cumulative or partly cumulative sentences should be imposed, in order to properly reflect the overall criminality of the entire offending. It follows that whenever more than one limiting term is being imposed, questions of concurrency and accumulation will necessarily arise for consideration under s 23(1). 

33His Honour said that he had considered all of these matters, but the accumulation of the terms imposed is a matter to which it will be necessary to return in relation to ground 3. 

34This ground of appeal was not, however, established.

Ground 2 - The finding that the applicant engaged in simulated intercourse - count 8

35The applicant did not give evidence on conviction or sentence. The Crown called evidence from the victims and other witnesses. The second victim was aged about 6 and a half years at the time of the offence, which occurred in February 2011, when she, her mother and younger sister had stayed with the applicant's family over the weekend. The applicant was then some 32 years of age. 

36In her evidence the victim described what had happened to her. Understandably, given her age, she did not use the term 'simulated intercourse'. That was a description which his Honour adopted. 

37Count 8 was described by his Honour in the sentencing judgment as having occurred on the day of her departure from the applicant's home. She was then at the back of the house on her own, while everyone else was at the front. The applicant used his finger to beckon her and told her to jump into a caravan in the back yard. His Honour observed:

"" ... after she went into the van, he pulled down his pants, took his doodle out and then rolled around on her performing an act of simulated intercourse ... . During this act, whilst on top of the victim, he moved about whilst his penis was in contact with her genital area without any clothing separating those parts of their respective bodies. There is no evidence that his penis was erect.""


38In the earlier conviction judgment, his Honour had also referred to the victim's evidence, observing:

""She said this incident occurred when everyone else was out the front of the house and she was at the back. She said that he went like this, demonstrating a beckoning movement similar to that demonstrated by Felicity, and he said: ""jump in the van"". [The victim] said that, after she went to the van, he pulled down his pants, took his doodle out and rolled on her.
Although she said nothing else happened, she went on to say that she was on the bed, he pulled her dress up and went like that. The recitation of this incident upon which the Crown relies to prove count 8 is quite disjointed in the interview and intermingled with descriptions of other incidents. She said that his tummy was touching her body and his doodle was touching her wee-wee. She did not know if it was on the outside or the inside of her wee-wee. She said he was rolling around in circles. She said the accused's doodle was soft and she felt disgusted.
In summary the Court is satisfied that she was describing an act of simulated intercourse in the caravan, which is what the Crown relies upon to prove count 8, and that when referring to her wee-wee she was referring to her genital area. It is also satisfied that she meant penis when she used the word ""doodle"". The disjointed nature of her account is what might be expected of a child of about six and a half years of age.""


39On sentencing the case for the applicant was put by way of written submissions. There was no submission made there, or in oral submissions, that his Honour's earlier description of what the evidence had established as 'simulated intercourse', was incorrect. Orally it was submitted, however, that the offences were opportunistic and not for the purpose of sexual gratification, there being no evidence of sexual arousal. It was also submitted that the applicant's acts were 'more consistent with childlike curiosity rather than obtaining sexual gratification'.

40His Honour plainly did not accept those submissions. Given the evidence of the applicant's acts, his Honour's description does not appear inaccurate, reflecting as it does that his Honour did not find that those acts included penetration. On the evidence, it was clearly open to his Honour to consider that they were the result, at the least, of sexual interest. 

41In my view this ground was not established. 

Ground 6 - failure to make any allowance for the applicant's good character

42His Honour took the view that the applicant could not claim the benefit of good character, given his record. In 1998, he was sentenced to a 2 year community based order by the County Court of Victoria, to undergo treatment for sexually penetrating a child aged between 10 and 16 years and indecently assaulting a child under 16 years. The applicant was then aged 15 years and the victim of the sexual penetration 10 years. He was 17 when the same victim was involved in touching his penis. 

43His Honour also took the view that while these convictions were old and the applicant was a juvenile at the time, they were relevant to be considered in relation to rehabilitation and the issue of protection of the community. 

44On appeal it was accepted for the applicant that this record was relevant, but it was submitted that necessary consideration was not given to the fact that the applicant had the same intellectual limitations at the time of his earlier offending. In the result, it was argued, he should have received some benefit or leniency for his otherwise good character, given that he had no other criminal matters of any kind, in the intervening period.

45This submission must be rejected. 

46In Dousha v R [2008] NSWCCA 263 it was observed at [49]:

""...While an offender's previous good character must be taken into account on sentence its weight as a matter in mitigation of sentence will vary depending on the circumstances of the offending (Ryan v R [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 per McHugh J at 275). In the context of offending constituted by a course of repeated sexual offending against young children a claim for good character does not entitle an offender to the leniency that might otherwise be available (see R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172 at [43] and [44]).""


47As discussed by Buddin J in R v ABS [2005] NSWCCA 255, repeat offending in the context of sexual offences deprives on offender of a claim for leniency that might otherwise be available where the offending was spontaneous and only involves an isolated incident. This was referred to in R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172, where it was observed at [44] as to a pattern of repeat offending over a period in the course of an ongoing relationship between the respondent and a child:

""... Where these features are present a finding that the criminal conduct is out of character fails to recognise that a determined and conscious course of offending, perhaps in the expectation that the child may not see the offending conduct as wrong thereby both avoiding detection and maximising the opportunity for repeated offending, diminishes the mitigating impact of a finding of good character""



48I do not consider that in this case, even though the applicant's record was not extensive, his Honour erred in his approach. The applicant's record was relevant and his Honour was entitled to take it into account as he did. Given the terms imposed, that he gave that record undue weight, is not apparent.

49I consider that this ground was not established. 

Ground 3 - The limiting terms imposed were unusually harsh and severe
Ground 4 - Failure to take account that the applicant was not fully aware of his actions, because of his mental disability (s 21A(3)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act
Ground 5 - Imposing a longer sentence based on protection of the community

50It is convenient to deal with these grounds of appeal together. In summary, I consider that grounds 4 and 5 have not been established, but that ground 3 has, for reasons connected with how the limiting terms were structured.

51The applicant's case on sentencing was not that a custodial sentence was inappropriate. It was submitted that the sentences for the two sets of offences, which had each occurred over a short discrete period, should be concurrent and that any accumulation of the terms imposed for the offences involving the second victim should be partial, because full accumulation would result in a limiting term that exceeded the applicant's overall criminality. It was urged that the limiting terms imposed would not exceed the time the applicant had already spent in custody. 

52By reference to Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 it was submitted that the applicant's mental disability was highly relevant to the sentencing process, making him a person who had limited moral culpability for his offence and that accordingly, general deterrence should play no role in the sentencing exercise and that retribution and denunciation did not require significant emphasis. His difficulties in custody were also emphasised, as was his isolation from his family. 

53On appeal it was argued that the total limiting terms imposed were unduly harsh, being 'the equivalent of a putative head sentence of approximately 3 years'. That submission cannot be accepted. Nothing in his Honour's remarks suggests that he did not fix the limiting terms imposed by reference to the total sentence which would have been imposed on the applicant, had he been convicted after a normal trial, as s 23 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act required.

54The total term imposed was 2 years, 3 months. Had a non-parole period been fixed after a normal criminal trial, it would have been of a lesser period than this, as required by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Ordinarily, when fixing such a non-parole period a balance of term must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period. Nothing in his Honour's remarks suggest that he wrongly took this exercise into account, when determining the limiting terms which he imposed.

55It was further submitted that the terms imposed did not have proper regard to the objective and subjective circumstances which had to be considered on sentencing, but fell into a range more appropriate to a person not suffering from the applicant's mental disabilities. Further, that his mental abnormality should have rendered the applicant an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and that it reduced or eliminated the need for specific deterrence. 

56It was also argued that his Honour had wrongly proceeded on the basis that the applicant was motivated by sexual gratification, despite having found that he was not sexually aroused at the time of the offences and that lack of sexual gratification should have been taken into account as a mitigating factor. In Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 it was observed at [49]:

""However in the present case the question of whether the conduct of the applicant was motivated by a desire for sexual gratification was necessarily an important one. It has been recognised by this Court that in matters of this nature, the question of whether the offending was so motivated is a significant factor to be taken into account in any assessment of objective seriousness. In R v Dunn (CCA (NSW) 15 April 1992 unreported) Gleeson CJ said:

""The act of which the appellant was found guilty was, by definition, an act of sexual intercourse. In my view it is material, indeed most material, to take into account that the conduct in question was not done for any form of sexual gratification and was an act committed by this young offender in a fit of irritability and at a time when her capacity for judgment was impaired by the ingestion of drugs. Those are circumstances which I think were insufficiently taken into account by the learned sentencing judge.""


57Contrary to these submissions, it is evident from his Honour's remarks that he paid careful attention to the evidence as to the applicant's intellectual disability and the nature of his sexual interest in his victims. 

58This led him to conclude that the applicant's condition was such that less weight had to be given to deterrence, retribution and denunciation, than would otherwise have been the case. There was no error in that conclusion. It accorded with the approach discussed in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. 

59Nor did his Honour err in concluding that the applicant was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions. Properly, it seems to me, that was one of the matters which gave rise to his Honour's concerns about the need for protection of the community. Contrary to the submissions advanced for the applicant, that was a matter to which he was obliged to have regard, s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) providing:

""3A Purposes of sentencing
The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:
(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,
(c) to protect the community from the offender,
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""


60It was the applicant who tendered Dr Furst's reports. He was a consultant forensic psychiatrist working at Long Bay Hospital who first interviewed the applicant in April 2012, for some 60 minutes. In his report of 2 May 2012 Dr Furst explained the basis for his opinion that the applicant was not fit to be tried, as well as his diagnosis that the applicant suffered from a development disability of a moderate degree. He also referred to the applicant's report of having a sexual attraction to women, but not children. The applicant then denied the acts the subject of the charges.

61Dr Furst assessed the applicant again in December 2012 for approximately 30 minutes. He also had access to numerous documents; including the applicant's criminal record, reports of another psychiatrist Dr Nielsen, a psychologist report, medical files and a June 2012 determination of the Mental Health Tribunal. In his 14 January 2013 report Dr Furst noted a similar report from the applicant as to his sexual orientation and desires, making the additional observation that the applicant then denied 'sexual desires generally.' He also denied feeling sexually frustrated or having any deviant fantasies. The applicant did not give evidence, so this report was not tested. It does not accord with the evidence on which he was convicted.

62Those sexual acts, the steps he took to entice the victims to his van, his apparent awareness of wrongdoing, telling one victim not to tell what he had done, the acts in which he engaged and what was contained in Dr Furst's reports, provided a proper basis for his Honour's rejection of the notion that there was no sexual gratification involved in his offending.

63Dr Furst expressed the opinion:

""The level of his disability would make it much more difficult than the ordinary person to understand concepts and hard for him to learn new information. It would also make it more difficult for him to communicate his understanding to others.

[RS] also appears to meet criteria for a paraphilia, which is a disorder of deviant sexual arousal and a pattern of abnormal sexual behaviour dating back to his adolescence. The nature of his deviant behaviour and presence of any deviant sexual fantasies was not clear to me. Further assessment is warranted in the context of any sex offender treatment programs he engages in.""


64Dr Furst considered that the applicant would benefit from further assessment and treatment to improve his behaviour and communication skills. In the event of release into the community, he recommended a treatment plan which included appointments with a clinical psychologist to address the applicant's sexual behaviours and to help him establish appropriate personal boundaries; the possible prescription of anti-androgen agents; and the goal of treatment with anti-libidinal agents, to remove deviant sexual arousal. In custody he recommended placement in a special unit for inmates with a developmental disability and a behavioural management plan along similar lines to that recommended, if released to the community. 

65In sentencing his Honour thus considered the need for protection of the community. He concluded that:

""...because of his intellectual disability, it gave greater weight to rehabilitation and less weight to deterrence, retribution and denunciation. However the need for protection of the community pulls in a different direction from the considerations concerning rehabilitation.""


66That conclusion involved no error. As discussed in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at [9]:

""It is one thing to say that the principle of proportionality precludes the imposition of a sentence extended beyond what is appropriate to the crime merely to protect society; it is another thing to say that the protection of society is not a material factor in fixing an appropriate sentence. The distinction in principle is clear between an extension merely by way of preventive detention, which is impermissible, and an exercise of the sentencing discretion having regard to the protection of society among other factors, which is permissible."" 


67Further, as was observed at [10]:

""It must be acknowledged, however, that the practical observance of a distinction between extending a sentence merely to protect society and properly looking to society's protection in determining the sentence calls for a judgment of experience and discernment.""


68In this case that difficult exercise had to be conducted in circumstances were the offences in relation to the first victim were committed while she was staying with her grandparents, the applicant's parents, with whom he lived, for the first time on her own, for a period of about a month. She was then aged 7 years. At that time the applicant lived and slept in one of two caravans in the rear yard of the house. His sister occupied the other van.

69Counts 1 and 2 related to an occasion on 10 July 2010 when the applicant gave the first victim a signal, by moving his finger, while she was playing with her cousin. Only she entered the van. He put on a movie, 'Alf' and then showed her his penis, by pulling down his pants so that they were around his knees. This gave rise to count 1. He told her not to tell anyone what he had done. He then touched her in the area of her genitals, which he called her 'Minnie', under her clothes, so that his hand came in contact with her skin. This gave rise to count 2. He then told her to leave the van.

70The following Saturday, 17 July, the victim was outside, listening to her iPod, while her grandfather was inside watching television. The applicant came out of the house, walked to the van and again signalled her with his finger, beckoning her into he van. He closed the door and she sat on the bed and the applicant put on a movie. After sitting with her for a while, he got up, pulled his pants down and exposed his penis to the victim. This gave rise to count 3. He then walked towards her, knelt down and touched her private parts by sliding his hand under her pants at the front, bringing the back of his hand into contact with her genital area. This gave rise to count 4. 

71The final incident occurred the next day. The victim was then outside after lunch with her cousin, teaching two dogs tricks. The accused again signalled her to the caravan and her cousin went inside. Again, he put on a movie and the victim sat on the bed to watch. Again, he pulled down his shorts and exposed his penis. This gave rise to count 5. He was looking into the victim's eyes as he did so. He then pulled up his shorts and walked to the victim, knelt down and put his left hand down her jeans and touched her on the genital area with the back of his hand, giving rise to count 6.

72The victim did not tell her mother about these offences until April 2011, when her mother spoke to her. Her explanation was that she was too scared to tell her mother, but she could not articulate why.

73As to the second victim, the circumstances of count 8 have earlier been referred to. Count 9 occurred shortly afterwards, while the victim was still in the van. The applicant then separated the opening of her vagina, using his fingers and looked in, without actually penetrating her. The same day the applicant was sitting in the house while playing cards, while the victim was standing up. He touched her genitals on the outside or the inside of her clothes. That gave rise to count 10. That day while they were at the kitchen table, he took hold of the victim's arm and forced her hand to come into contact with his penis. That gave rise to count 11.

74The applicant's circumstances were found to be that he suffered from significant intellectual disability, placing him in the bottom 0.3 per cent of the population. His language skills are particularly compromised and he is illiterate and innumerate. He has some general living skills, but cannot live independently in the community. He has always lived in relatively remote regional areas and apart from helping his father run a farm, has not worked. He is socially isolated. He had been assaulted in custody and on sentencing was in protection. His Honour found that as a result, custody would be more burdensome for him than for other inmates. 

75His Honour considered the age of the victims and the fact that the offences were committed while they were houseguests in his parents' home. He found it probable that the offences were opportunistic. Each offence involved brief acts, which his Honour considered was as the result of a desire to avoid detection. He took into account that no physical harm resulted, that no threats were used and that the victim's silence had not been bought by gifts. He also observed that such offences could have a significant and long term impact on children, as the victim impact statements received had illustrated. 

76His Honour concluded that because of his intellectual disability, the applicant's moral culpability had been significantly reduced. There was no evidence of sexual arousal at the time of the offences, which all fell within the low range. He considered that the assault involving simulated intercourse and separating the vagina of the second victim and looking in, were more serious than the other acts of touching. His Honour found that count 10 was the least serious of those offences, because he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this touching was under the victim's clothing.

77His Honour found that as a result of his disability, the applicant had no insight into his offending and that it was unlikely that he would ever learn what is appropriate and inappropriate behaviour towards children. He noted his mother's evidence that he always denied an allegation, when confronted with it. He also noted Dr Furst's opinion, that he met the criteria for paraphilia disorder of deviant sexual arousal and a pattern of abnormal sexual behaviour, back to adolescence. 

78His Honour observed that the attitude of his mother and sister towards the victims indicated that at least two of his three primary carers lacked an appreciation of the seriousness of his conduct and breach of bail. Dr Furst's recommendation for 24-hour supervision was also noted. 

79His Honour concluded that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and not re-offending were poor and that there was a need to protect the community. He noted that his prospects would improve, if he received the treatment Dr Furst recommend, but concluded that he then posed a danger to the community. He also considered that with appropriate treatment, including pharmacological intervention and compliance and supervision by responsible individuals, not including his mother and sister, this concern could be overcome, or ameliorated.

80His Honour concluded that while a custodial sentence was a sentence of last resort, in this case there would have been a custodial sentence imposed after a normal trial and that accordingly, limiting terms should be set under s 23.

81While I can see no error in any of those conclusions, it was argued on appeal that his Honour was not addressed on the basis that the applicant was a danger to the community and that he had poor prospects of rehabilitation. Those conclusions were said not to have been justified on the evidence and not supported by any expert evidence, particularly given the lack of any criminal record between March 1998, for offences committed in 1994. 

82Nor were they justified by the opinions expressed by Dr Furst, which were submitted to have involved only a 'tentative' opinion that the applicant suffered from paraphilia. There was no supporting evidence for Dr Furst's opinion; that the diagnosis was incomplete and that even Dr Furst had suggested that it required further assessment. Further, his opinion did not exclude treatment in the community and that it was manifestly unfair that the applicant's mother and sister had been excluded as responsible persons for his supervision. 

83It was also argued that on the evidence, no imprisonment was likely to have had any effect on the applicant's behaviour and in the circumstances, any perceived difficulty in the applicant remaining in the community, ought to have been canvassed with his legal advisers. 

84These submissions cannot be accepted. They overlook the circumstances in which the applicant had been refused bail in December 2012 and what occurred at the sentencing hearing. 

85His Honour had a concern about the attitudes of the applicant's mother and sister, which had been revealed on the earlier evidence. No further evidence about the applicant's supervision was called. During submissions on sentencing, his Honour raised with the parties the question of the danger which the applicant posed to the community, the suitability of his mother and sister to supervise the applicant, the earlier breach of his bail, their attitude to the danger which he posed to children and his record. 

86The applicant's case was that his Honour should conclude that the limiting terms imposed should reflect the time he had already spent in custody. It was submitted to be relevant that the applicant's offences were opportunistic, rather than predatory; that he had limited moral culpability, given his significant disability and that objectively, his offences were not serious, being more consistent with childlike curiosity, than to obtain sexual gratification. His mental condition was also submitted to significantly reduce the objective gravity of his offending and that his record should be disregarded entirely. It was also urged that it would be concluded that the offences fell at the bottom of the range and that any accumulation should be partial. 

87The Crown submitted that the limiting terms had to be fixed under s 23 on the basis of what an appropriate term of imprisonment would be, at a normal trial, without regard to any question of non-parole periods. That involved the normal approach necessary to be taken to offenders suffering from mental illness, making them less appropriate vehicles for general and specific deterrence. It was also submitted that regard had to be paid to Dr Furst's opinions, as to the applicant's lack of insight, his record and the attitude of his family members, when assessing the likelihood of his re-offending.

88It was also submitted that the lack of insight and limited understanding of the criminality involved in his conduct, was two-edged, raising as it did the risk of re-offending which existed. That there had been no sexual gratification obtained by the applicant, was argued not to diminish the impact of the offence on his victims. 

89A limiting term backdated to expire on the day of sentencing, would not adequate reflect the criminality of the offending and the risk of further offending, particularly given the unsatisfactory arrangements for supervision available in the environment to which he would return. 

90As to accumulation, it was accepted that there should be some slight accumulation for each discrete set of offences, but that a total limiting term of only about 16 months would not be adequate. It was submitted that assessment of when the community would no longer be endangered by the applicant's release was a matter to be determined by the Mental Health Tribunal under s 43. 

91It follows that the submission on appeal that his Honour was not addressed as to concerns about the danger which the applicant posed to the community and the problems he perceived with the supervision arrangements, was not correct. His Honour's approach to these matters has not been shown to have involved any error. Nor has error been demonstrated in the individual sentences imposed. As discussed by Gleeson CJ in R v Engert (at 68): 

""A moment's consideration will show that the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex and on occasion even intricate. In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other considerations. For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. ... It is therefore erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances. In every case, what is called for is the making of a discretionary decision in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, and in the light of the purposes to be served by the sentencing exercise.""


92As I have explained, however, the overall structure of the limiting terms which his Honour imposed was unusual, in that there was a hiatus between the day that the limiting term for count 6 expired on 4 April 2012 and the day that the limiting term for count 10 commenced on 28 October. That was a period of some 6 months and 5 days. 

93The result of his Honour's approach was that the total of the terms imposed on 8 February 2013 was some 2 years, 3 months. The total period that the applicant had spent to that day in custody bail refused, was 1 year, 3 months and 21 days. The total period he was to serve in custody after 8 February, was thus 11 months, 9 days.

94Had his Honour adopted the more usual approach of commencing the term imposed for counts 1, 3 and 5, some 1 year, 3 months and 21 days before 8 February 2013, that being the total time that the applicant had spent in custody, as s 23(4) permitted, those terms would have commenced on 18 October 2011. On that approach, the total term of 2 years and 3 months imposed would have expired on 17 January 2014, rather than 27 January 2014.

95Had his Honour so approached the sentencing exercise, there would have been no necessity for any hiatus period. Further, application of the principle of totality would then have required consideration to be given to the question of the accumulation of the limiting terms imposed in respect of the offences involving the two victims. As discussed in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45]:

""To an offender, the only relevant question may be ""how long"", and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality [Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59.]."" 


96This was a matter which his Honour was obliged to consider under s 23(1), which required that he make 'the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings'. That his Honour did give consideration to this question is apparent from his consideration of the principle of totality. 

97In relation to the first victim his Honour took into account that the offences were committed over a short time and that they involved separate acts on separate days, with the result that his Honour considered that 'some modest accumulation is called for'. He also said that:

""There should also be some accumulation as between those offences and the offences involving the other victim. It seems to the Court that they arose out of three separate events. The events involving the simulated intercourse and looking in the vagina are temporally quite proximate. What period of time separated them from the other two acts in the house is unclear. What period of time separated the two acts in the house is also unclear."" 


98While the terms imposed for the various offences committed in respect of the two victims provided for some modest accumulation, as his Honour intended, as the result of the hiatus in the terms imposed, there was complete accumulation as between the offences involving the two victims. That does not appear to be what his Honour intended, or what would have resulted, had the applicant been sentenced for these offences after a normal trial. 

99Questions of concurrency and accumulation are discretionary, as explained in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]:

""... there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.""



100In this case it seems to me that after a normal trial, proper application of these principles would have resulted in some measure of concurrency as between the terms imposed in respect of both the individual offences and those involving the two victims, as his Honour intended, rather than the total accumulation which resulted from the imposition of the hiatus period. 

101It seems to me that the overall limiting terms imposed were too severe, being longer than the period for which the applicant would have been sentenced, after a normal trial. Otherwise, however, I do not consider that the limiting terms which his Honour imposed were unduly harsh. 

102In the result, in my view the applicant must be re-sentenced. 

103On re-sentencing the applicant relied on a 2 May 2013 report to the Court from the Mental Health Review Tribunal, which advised that it had made a determination under s 24(2) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, finding that the applicant was still not fit to be tried. He was, however, not found to be suffering from any mental illness or mental condition and was found not to require any ongoing treatment. 

104Having regard to the evidence as to the overall criminality of the applicant's offending and applying the principle of totality, I would impose individual limiting terms under s 23(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act totalling 2 years, commencing from 17 October 2011 and expiring on 16 October 2013 as follows:

Victim 1

Count 1 (10 July 2010); count 3 (17 July 2010); and count 5 (18 July 2010):
Section 61O(2) - an act of indecency towards a person under the age of 10 years - maximum penalty 7 years - exposure of penis: 
Limiting terms of 1 month to commence on 18 October 2011 expiring 17 November 2011

Count 2 (10 July 2010)
Section 61M(2) - aggravated indecent assault of a person under the age of 16 year - maximum penalty 10 years - touched victim on her genitals (bare): 
Limiting term of 8 months to commence on 18 October 2011 expiring 17 June 2012

Count 4 (17 July 2010)
Section 61M(2) - touched victim on her genitals: 
Limiting term of 8 months to commence on 18 December 2011 expiring 17 August 2012

Count 6 (18 July 2010)
Section 61M(2) - touched victim on her genitals:
Limiting term of 8 months to commence on 18 February 2012 expiring 17 October 2012

Victim 2

Count 10 (13 February 2011)
Section 61M(2) - touched victim on her genitals:
Limiting term of 5 months to commence on 18 June 2012 expiring 17 November 2012

Count 11 (13 February 2011)
Section 61M(2) - forcing victim's hand onto his penis:
Limiting term of 8 months to commence on 18 July 2012 expiring 17 March 2013

Count 8 and count 9 (13 February 2011)
Section 61M(2) - 'simulated intercourse' and opening the victim's vagina with fingers and looking in, without actual penetration:
Limiting terms of 14 months to commence on 18 August 2012 expiring 17 October 2013

Orders

105The orders I would propose are:

1. Leave to appeal is granted. 

2. The appeal is allowed. 

3. The limiting terms imposed by Sides DCJ on 8 February 2013 are quashed.

2420449,O'Connor v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 226,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Barr AJ and the orders which he proposes.
2BELLEW J: I agree with Barr AJ.
3BARR AJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court. The applicant, Michael Joseph O'Connor, pleaded guilty to a charge of supplying a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine. No actual supply was detected and the Crown relied on the deeming provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty was 15 years' imprisonment. English DCJ set a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months. The sentence was partly accumulated on an existing sentence. The applicant had been sentenced to serve a period of 4 years following his conviction for recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm. He had served the non-parole period and had been released but his parole was revoked. Her Honour backdated the sentence so as to make the first 6 months or so concurrent with the previous sentence. The applicant's present non-parole period is due to expire on 3 July 2014 and his head sentence on 3 January 2016.
The Facts
4At about 6pm on Wednesday 16 November 2011 police executed a search warrant on Room 34 of the Lachlan Hotel in Cowra where the applicant was staying at the time.
5In the seat of a chair in the room police found a large plastic bag with a resealable end that contained 27.1 grams of methylamphetamine the purity of which was 12.5 per cent. After being cautioned and arrested the applicant denied any knowledge of the bag or its contents. Within the top drawer of a chest of drawers police found a Calvin Klein aftershave box containing $485 in cash as well as two glass smoking pipes inside a sunglasses case. The applicant said to police that the money was from his unemployment benefit and that he had bought the sunglasses from a person at another hotel but denied any knowledge of the existence of the pipes. A further bag containing 7.8 grams of methylamphetamine (81.5 per cent purity) was found inside the second drawer along with 2 more glass smoking pipes. Again the applicant initially denied any knowledge of these items. On and in a wardrobe in the room police found a CD cover containing electronic scales and a bag containing a large number of small resealable plastic bags. In relation to the scales the applicant said that he had bought the CDs from ""a bloke"" and opened the cover to find the scales.
6The applicant was found with a total of 34.9 grams of methylamphetamine. The trafficable quantity is 3 grams and the commercial quantity is 250 grams.
7After his arrest, the applicant exercised his right to silence.
8The applicant gave evidence during the sentencing hearing. He said that he was 42 years of age. He said that his father, a Vietnam veteran, had been affected by Agent Orange and had showed a lot of violence towards the applicant and his other children, and to their mother. He said that he had been subjected to an episode of sexual abuse from his brother and from a friend of his brother's. He said that he believed that his experiences as a child had had some impact on his later use of drugs. He said that most of his earlier convictions for drug offences related to cannabis. 
9In relation to the offence itself the applicant gave this evidence in chief:-
Q: How long have you been using methamphetamine as opposed to your criminal history that shows that it's mainly cannabis? A: Probably five, six years. That was prior to the last incarceration I was smoking it so the year before I was locked up then.
Q: But you do understand the elements of the offence of supply?A: Yes, yes I do.
Q: And do you fully admit that?A: I do admit it and I realise I done the wrong thing in supplying drugs. To be put in an environment where I am I really - it really hits me really what I was doing and how wrong it was.
Q: Why were you doing it?A: I was doing it to support my own habit really. There was a couple of reasons there why I was doing it but the main reason was to support my own habit. I realise I was supply (sic) drugs.
10In cross-examination the applicant gave this evidence:-
Q: And one of those bags had a purity of 81-and-a-half per cent. Have you seen the lab report about that? A: I have.
Q:   Very, very high purity isn't it sir in terms of street level methylamphetamine?A: Yes it is.
Q: Something that could be cut and cut and cut again in terms of onward supply to others is that not right? A: Not really.
Q: Sir isn't it the case that street level methylamphetamine, the purity is somewhere three to five per cent? A: No.
Q: What would you say it is? A: It's a lot higher.
Q: See I suggest to you that in general terms three to five per cent is about the mark on the street? A: No.
Q: Sir you were making some money on the side from the sale of these drugs weren't you? A: Yes I was.
Q: Making some profit?A: I wouldn't say profit. I was making just enough back so I could buy some more.
Q: Well you're selling it for more than you paid for it were you not, cutting it and then getting some more money than what you ultimately paid for it?A: No I wasn't cutting it and I only had like two or three people that were actually buying drugs off me.
Q: But you were certainly making some money from the deals?A: I was.
Q: Yes and you said that you primarily - in effect you said you primarily sold these drugs to support your drug addiction?A: Yes.
Q: You also said to your lawyer that there are a couple of reasons but that was the main one. What were the other ones? A: The main reason for selling drugs.
Q: Sorry I'll slow down. You said that you sold the drugs to support your own habit is what you -A: Yes.
Q: Well your actual words were and I quote you, ""There are a couple of reasons but the main reason was to support my own habit"" right? A: Yes.
Q: My question to you is what were the other reasons?A: What were the other reasons I was using the drugs or supplying the drugs.
Q: Supplying?A: Pretty much out of friendship. I didn't know anyone in town and 
Q: Was that a way to make friends to be a supplier to someone?A: Well it wasn't a way to make friends. I was approached on theacknowledgment that I would supply a couple of people. It was one at first and then became two, then three that I would supply them with the drugs.
Q: Were you looking to increase your business at that point when police found you?A: No I don't think so because I was - I was getting the drugs at very - a cheaper price than what one would usually pay.
Q: But certainly if the word got out that you could supply the drug you had the drug there and the means to split it up and bag it and sell it? A: Yeah well I was approached on that matter and I told the people that were buying off me if your friend wants drugs I don't wish to meet him, he can give the money to you and you can pass it on to me.
Q: Because you wanted to deal with somebody you knew and trusted? A: Yeah well - yes.
11There was evidence that the applicant was being treated for depression. The author of a psychological report tendered on his behalf offered the opinion that the depression was likely to be a response to his imprisonment rather than entrenched or characteristic behaviour.
12It was apparent that the applicant had used cannabis from 13 years of age and amphetamine as well as cocaine from 17 or 18 years of age.
The Ground of Appeal
13There is a single ground of appeal, namely that the sentencing judge erred in finding as an aggravating factor that the applicant was supplying for profit over and above the drugs in his possession for his own use.
14On sentence the Crown submitted that the offence was aggravated because it was committed for financial gain. The Crown referred not only to the applicant's evidence but to the amount of the drugs seized, almost 7 times the indictable quantity, and the fact that the lesser portion of the drug seized was 81 per cent pure.
15The purity of the drug might have implied that the applicant intended to cut it for redistribution. However, although there was evidence of resealable plastic bags and scales, no cutting agent was found. Her Honour said that the purity of the drug alone did not satisfy her beyond reasonable doubt of an intent to supply. That left only the evidence given by the applicant himself. As to that, her Honour said:-
I cannot therefore be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was aware of the high purity of the substances in his possession or that he was intending to further increase his activities by cutting the drug with a cutting agent and thereby increasing the profit to be made by him, despite the high purity and the destructive potential to which I have just been referring.
The Submissions on Appeal
16Mr Nash, counsel for the applicant, submitted on appeal that the evidence given by the applicant to her Honour did not justify her Honour's findings. Mr Nash relied on the statement in Cicciarello v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 272 in which Allsop P, Fullerton and McCallum JJ said at [17]:-
Whilst one should be careful about generalising in relation to such factors outside the circumstances of any particular case, here, quite clearly, when one understands the background of this young man and what he was doing, he was not selling for greed or for financial gain, he was selling to feed a drug habit that he had acquired. This does not detract from the fact that he committed a serious offence, but what it does mean is that it was an error, and an important one, to characterise this as selling for financial gain and thus to characterise it as an offence falling within the mid-range. In our view, that latter conclusion must clearly have been affected by the finding of financial gain because no other basis in the facts could found such a conclusion.
17In this Court counsel for the Crown drew attention to portions of the applicant's evidence on sentence, viz:-

Q. Why were you doing it? A. I was doing it to support my own habit really. There was a couple of reasons there why I was doing it but the main reason was to support my own habit.   I realise I was supply (sic) drugs''
Q. Sir you were making some money on the side from the sale of these drugs weren't you?A.  Yes I was.
Q. Making some profit?A. I wouldn't say profit. I was making just enough back so I could buy some more.
Q. Well you're selling it for more than you paid for it were you not, cutting it and then getting some more money than what you ultimately paid for it?A. No I wasn't cutting it and I only had like two or three people that were actually buying drugs off me.
Q. But you were certainly making some money from the deals?A. I was.
...
Q. Were you looking to increase your business at that point when police found you?A. No I don't think so because I was - I was getting the drugs at very - a  cheaper price than what one would usually pay.
Q. But certainly if the word got out that you could supply the drug you had the drug there and the means to split it up and bag it up and sell it?A. Yeah well I was approached on that matter and I told the people that were buying it off me if your friend wants drugs I don't wish to meet him, he can give the money to you and you can pass it on to me.
Q. Because you wanted to deal with somebody you knew and trusted?A.  Yeah well - yes. 

18On that evidence, the Crown submitted, her Honour was justified in coming to the conclusion that the applicant was in part supplying for financial reward, with a consequent aggravation of his criminality.
19I have read the whole of the applicant's evidence. The portion I have extracted from the applicant's written submissions in this Court (see [9] - [10] above) better reflects, I think, what the applicant was really telling her Honour. That, I think, was that although he was making money from the sale of drugs, it was only enough to enable him to buy more for his own use. I think that her Honour erred in her conclusion. The applicant's complaint has been made good.
The Consequences of a Finding of Error
20The mere demonstration of error in the sentencing court does not entitle an applicant for leave to appeal against sentence to a reduction in the sentence. It must first appear to this Court that a lesser sentence is warranted in law: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 6(3). The Court must be of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted before it interferes with the sentence imposed, notwithstanding that error has been found: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 in the judgment of Spigelman CJ, with whom Mason P, Grove J and Newman AJ agreed at [74]. See also the judgment of Sully J at [100].
21The applicant was a mature man. There are 40 prior convictions recorded against him, many of them involving the use of drugs, including inappropriate use of alcohol, and offences of violence. He has served a number of terms of imprisonment. I would not regard his record as justifying any more severe sentence than would otherwise be appropriate, but it disentitles him to leniency. Statistics put before the Court show that only 51 per cent of persons pleading guilty to an offence of this type receive custodial sentences. They also show that the head sentence of 3 years and 6 months, even ignoring the benefit of partial concurrency with the balance of parole of the previous sentence, is within the range. 
22Taking all these matters into account, I think that the resulting sentence is unremarkable and appropriate. In my opinion no lesser sentence is warranted in law.
23I propose the following orders:-
1.Grant leave to appeal;
2.Dismiss the appeal.

2420497,Andrew Iskandar v R [2013] NSWCCA 235,"Judgment
1THE COURT: On 28 November 2011 Andrew Iskandar (""the applicant"") was found guilty by a jury of the murder of Mohd Shah Saemin (""the deceased"").

2The applicant's father, Hazairin Iskandar, was tried separately for the murder of the deceased and was found guilty by a jury on 27 June 2012. 

3On 16 March 2012 Davies J sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of 18 years imprisonment commencing 21 May 2010 and expiring 20 May 2028 with an additional term of 7 years expiring on 20 May 2035 (see R v Andrew Iskandar and R v Nita Iskandar (No 4) [2012] NSWSC 149 at [103]).

4On 7 December 2012 his Honour sentenced Hazairin Iskandar to a minimum term of 17 years imprisonment with an additional term of 6 years (see R v Hazairin Iskandar [2012] NSWSC 1324).
5The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him on the grounds more fully set out below.

THE FACTS
6The sentencing judge found the facts of the applicant's offending to be as follows:

""3 Nita Iskandar and Hazairin Iskandar were born in Indonesia. They were married in 1984 and moved to Australia some three months later. The marriage appears to have been an arranged marriage. There was only one child of the marriage being Andrew Iskandar. Andrew was born in Sydney on 16 May 1990. He was, therefore, 19 at the time of the offence. The family have lived at Croydon since about 1984. 

4 Hazairin worked as a taxi driver and Nita came to work as a clerk in the Malaysian Consulate in Sydney in 2000. The marriage was not a particularly happy one. There is conflicting evidence about whether Hazairin behaved violently towards Nita but, if he did, it seems to have been of a relatively minor nature. Nita told the Clinical Psychologist, Terry Smith, that the marriage was a loveless one on her part because her husband could not communicate nor consider her relationship needs. She said he was very controlling in all aspects of her life. She said, however, that she believed he loved her. 

5 The Deceased Mohd Shah Saemin (known as Shah) commenced employment with the Malaysian Consulate in 2006. He had a second job driving buses to and from the Airport. By early 2008 he and Nita appeared to have commenced having an affair. In the middle of 2009 Nita apparently requested a divorce from Hazairin but he refused because he still loved her. Hazairin was aware of the affair she was having and confronted the Deceased about it. 

6 It appears that the affair became reasonably public within the Indonesian community in Sydney. 

7 The Crown alleged a joint criminal enterprise between Hazairin and Andrew in relation to the killing of the Deceased. There was, undoubtedly, such a joint criminal enterprise and, as I shall make clear, such an enterprise was in existence by no later than the evening leading up to the death of the Deceased. What is more difficult to determine is precisely when, before that evening, the enterprise commenced. The evidence makes clear that Hazairin had set things in train to take some action against the Deceased at least a week before when he hired a rental car, but when Andrew became privy to and involved in what Hazairin seems to have planned is unclear. 

8 On 14 February 2010 Hazairin and Andrew went to the Kings Cross Branch of Budget Car Rentals. Hazairin effected the hiring of a car whilst Andrew sat on one of the chairs in the office. Hazairin was asked by the Budget representative if Andrew was to be an additional driver, but Hazairin said that Andrew was his son and that he was too young. 

9 At some time during the following week Hazairin and Andrew went in the rental car to the vicinity of the Malaysian Consulate in Woollahra. They parked the car in such a position that they could observe people and vehicles leaving the Consulate. Andrew took a photograph on his mobile phone from the front passenger seat of the car. The photograph depicts his father in the driver's seat, and the front of a property with a distinctive object on its front fence, probably only 100 metres from the Malaysian Consulate, can be seen in the background. 

10 Andrew claimed that he took this photograph because his father had taken him for a driving lesson and was showing him how to reverse park. The photograph, he said, was to enable him to see where, as a driver, he should be looking when he was reverse parking. This explanation for Hazairin and Andrew's presence at this location and the photograph must be rejected for a number of reasons. First, when the Iskandars lived at Croydon it is difficult to understand why Hazairin would give Andrew a driving lesson in Woollahra unless they were there for some other reason. Secondly, the car was a rental car and Andrew was not entitled to drive it whether because he was not approved as an additional driver or because he was a learner. Thirdly, contrary to Andrew's evidence, the photograph does not show Hazairin looking in the position Andrew described as demonstrating a reverse park. 

11 I find that the purpose of the presence of Hazairin and Andrew in the vicinity of the Malaysian consulate on that day was to spy upon either the Deceased or Nita or both of them. That finding necessarily carries with it the conclusion (which I also find) that at that time Andrew knew that his mother was having an affair with the Deceased. There is not sufficient evidence to find, however, beyond reasonable doubt that there was a joint criminal enterprise at that time to kill the Deceased or commit grievous bodily harm upon him. 

12 During the late afternoon and evening of 21 February there were a number of telephone calls and/or text messages passing between Andrew and Hazairin including a text message from Andrew to Hazairin which simply said ""?"". The Crown case was that this text concerned the planned murder and an enquiry from Andrew to Hazairin when it was to happen. It is not possible to reach a concluded view about what that message meant. 

13 Andrew and Hazairin left their home at some time late on the night of Sunday, 21 February 2010 in the rental car. They were both wearing similar clothing being dark hooded jackets. In the car was a knife and a hammer, possibly a crowbar and possibly a tool box. Andrew's explanation of how those implements were in the car was that Hazairin's taxi had broken down in Arncliffe on 20 February, Hazairin had rung him to say he needed Andrew to accompany him to help fix the taxi, Hazairin had then travelled to Croydon, put the tools in the rental car, taken Andrew with him in the rental car to the taxi, fixed the taxi with no help from Andrew, and then they had driven home in the taxi leaving the rental car in Arncliffe which Hazairin later retrieved. The explanation was that the tools must have been left in the rental car from that time. Andrew said, however, that he did not know any of the tools were in the car until the altercation with the Deceased began. I do not accept this account of how the weapons came to be in the car. I find that Andrew knew they were in the car before he and his father left home that night because they intended to use them on the Deceased. 

14 They drove over to the vicinity of Cromwell and Marion Sts in Leichhardt to wait for the Deceased to arrive home from his night job as an airport bus driver. When the Deceased arrived in that vicinity he parked his car on the western side of Cromwell St a short distance north of an electricity utility box. 

15 Either immediately before, or at the same time as, the Deceased alighted from his car, Hazairin drove the rental car at the Deceased's car and hit it at the rear. Thereafter both Hazairin and Andrew alighted from the rental car. Hazairin had a knife and Andrew had a hammer. They proceeded to assault the Deceased. The Deceased ran in a south-easterly direction towards Marion St passing close to the eastern corner of Cromwell St where it adjoins Marion St. He then ran across Marion St in a diagonal fashion in a south-easterly direction towards his house at number 2/24 Marion St. Hazairin and Andrew chased him. 

16 At the time the Deceased parked his car he was speaking on his mobile phone to Nita Iskandar. She heard the crash when Hazairin drove into the Deceased's car. She heard the Deceased cry out for help. The phone line remained open during the time the Deceased ran across the road because at one point Nita heard a woman's voice screaming out something about a hammer. That voice must have been the voice of Nada Bailey who came upon the scene where Hazairin and Andrew were attacking the Deceased. 

17 Nada Bailey was walking down Marion St from Norton St on the southern side. As she approached the intersection with Cromwell St she saw three men who were running across Marion St from the direction of Cromwell St. The two men on either side of the man in the middle appeared to be kicking him very hard. The man in the middle was trying to get away. He ran over towards Ms Bailey, and he was calling out ""help, help me"". She said the man tripped over the gutter as he approached her, and he fell to the ground outside number 28 Marion Street. She noticed his shirt was all wet. 

18 She shouted to the other two men to leave him alone but they continued to run after him. When he fell she tried to cover him with her body but one or both (she was not sure) of the two attackers kicked her out of the way into the gutter. One of the men was bashing him with a hammer like bashing a piece of meat. The other man stood to one side holding a small black object like a small bar. I am satisfied from other evidence that this object was the knife used to stab the Deceased. 

19 Whilst this was happening Janine Cahill was walking down the southern side of Marion Street. She saw what she thought at first were two men running across Marion St from Cromwell Street. As she continued walking she saw two men attacking a third man who was on the ground. She also saw Ms Bailey trying to protect the man on the ground. When she was about level with 18 Marion Street she rang 000 and asked for the police. She then yelled at the attackers telling them she had rung the police. She saw one of the men striking the Deceased very hard with a weapon a number of times. Then the two men ran off in the direction of Cromwell Street. 

20 The police were first notified at 11.53pm and arrived at the scene a short time afterwards. In the meantime Ms Cahill was performing CPR on the Deceased but she thought he was dead. Constable Hickey took over performing CPR until the ambulance arrived within minutes. The Deceased was pronounced dead at 12.05 am. 

21 The police had noticed the Deceased's silver Volvo in Cromwell St with the door open. Nita Iskandar later told Constable Hickey that it looked like the car the Deceased drove. Inspection of that car and its surrounds determined that it was the Deceased's car. It was damaged at the back where it had been struck by the rental car driven by Hazairin. A clump of what turned out later to be the Deceased's hair was found, and there was a trail of blood leading from that car across both Cromwell and Marion Sts. The police also located a hammer lying on the ground near the car. That hammer was later found to contain the DNA of Andrew Iskandar. 

22 The Post Mortem report makes it clear that the Deceased was both struck with a weapon consistent with being a hammer, and stabbed with a long-blade knife. The cause of death was a stab wound to the chest area which pierced his Vena Cava, the main vein carrying blood back to the heart. I find that it was Andrew Iskandar that struck the Deceased repeatedly with the hammer but it was Hazairin who stabbed him. 

23 Andrew gave evidence which can be summarised as follows. His father took him out on the night of the killing for a driving lesson in the rental car. After they ate dinner at about 11.00 pm at an Indian restaurant in Marion St, his father drove the car round and round in Leichhardt and then they parked in Cromwell St. When the Deceased arrived and parked his car in Cromwell St a short distance in front, Hazairin drove into it. Hazairin then alighted from the rental car and told the Deceased not to ""walk with my wife again"". The Deceased, after verbally abusing Hazairin, then physically attacked him. Up until this time Andrew had repeatedly asked his father what he was doing driving around, parking and crashing into the Deceased's car, but Hazairin told him to be quiet. Andrew then alighted from the car to go to his father's assistance. At one point his father handed him a hammer from the car and when the Deceased started punching Andrew Hazairin told Andrew to hit the Deceased with the hammer. Andrew did so once, striking him on the forehead, and then he dropped the hammer. 

24 Hazairin then tried to get something from the toolbox in the back of the rental car but the Deceased slammed the door on Hazairin's arm, dislocating it. 

25 The Deceased then ran across towards the flats on the corner of Cromwell and Marion Sts, and thereafter across Marion St. Hazairin chased him with Andrew following 15 metres behind. Then Andrew observed the Deceased lying on the ground. Hazairin was holding a knife in his left hand and a hammer in his right hand. He saw his father stab the Deceased with the knife and hit him with the hammer. Andrew was standing back holding a crow bar. While he was standing there a woman (who must have been Nada Bailey) came onto the road and pushed him. He then ran back to the rental car. 

26 The jury must have rejected this account of the events. I find, beyond reasonable doubt, that it is false. As to the events on the southern side of Marion St, the account is not only inconsistent with the evidence of Nada Bailey and Janine Cahill, but also of other witnesses who saw the events from vantage points in surrounding properties. It is also inconsistent with what Andrew Iskandar said to Victor Lau the following morning when he endeavoured to get him to agree to give a false alibi, and with what he told Esau Maiava in prison. 

27 Although Mr Maiava's evidence must be treated with some care I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Andrew told Mr Maiava that he and his father planned to kill the Deceased, that they had to wait until they knew when the Deceased arrived home from work, that they went to the vicinity of the Deceased's house on the night in question to await his arrival, that when he arrived home Hazairin drove into the Deceased's car, that the Deceased got out of his car to run away, and that both Hazairin and Andrew attacked and killed him, Hazairin with a knife and Andrew with a hammer. I accept that Andrew told Mr Maiava that he did it because his mother was having an affair and he couldn't handle that fact. I accept that Andrew told Mr Maiava he intended to beat the case by blaming it all on his father. 

28 I accept this evidence of Mr Maiava for a few reasons. First, the detail of it is such that it could only have been told to him by Andrew. Secondly, Mr Maiava made a contemporaneous note in his diary of the substance of what he said Andrew told him. Thirdly, some parts of it including Andrew's concern over his mother's affair and that he and his father acted jointly is corroborated by what he said to Mr Lau when trying to get him to provide a false alibi - that is, ""me and my dad killed some guy...we chased him...we crashed his car ... smacked him with a hammer and a knife"". 

29 The concern Andrew expressed to Mr Lau and Mr Maiava about his mother's affair was also consistent with evidence Andrew gave, that it was Andrew's religious belief that someone committing adultery is a big deal for someone from an Islamic perspective, that it was a terribly shameful thing from an Islamic point of view, that the woman involved was doing the wrong thing, and that the man should not be doing it. 

30 I find that by no later than when Andrew and Hazairin left home that night they were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to kill the Deceased. Their motive in doing so was to punish him for being in a relationship with Nita Iskandar. It is clear from the evidence of Mr Lau and Mr Maiava that the planning must have preceded the night of the killing and that there was a joint criminal enterprise from earlier than that night, but the evidence does not allow me to say how much earlier it began. ""

THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL
7The applicant relied upon four grounds of appeal. The Crown conceded the error which was relied upon in support of ground 4 and which will necessitate the intervention of this Court in order to backdate the applicant's sentence to its correct commencement date. We have considered the remaining three grounds in the same order in which they were dealt with on the hearing of the application. 

Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the applicant's depressive illness in assessing either the degree of moral culpability involved or in moderating the weight to be given to general deterrence.

The medical evidence tendered on sentence 
8Two reports were tendered on behalf of the applicant in the sentence proceedings. The first was that of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, of 26 January 2012. In setting out the history provided to him at the time of his examination of the applicant, Dr Nielssen stated (inter alia) as follows (at pages 1-2):

""When asked about his relationship with his father, Mr Iskandar said that his father was very strict, and that his mother usually backed his father up. He said that he was subjected to severe physical punishments from both parents during his childhood, and had sustained a number of injuries in assaults by his father. He said that he was subject to intrusive examination of his genitals by his mother and to inquiries about his bodily functions. He said that he was scared of his father and said ""whenever he screams time stops and my heart beats fast"". He also confirmed witnessing violence between his parents, but said that the police and child welfare agencies were never called.

Mr Iskandar said that he had witnessed his father become angry in other situations, but could not recall any incidents of actual violence or threatening confrontations that might have led to physical violence, for example, incidents of road rage.

When asked about his mental state on the night of Mr Saemin's death, Mr Iskandar said ""it was just a normal week"". He said that day he attended a lecture for orientation before commencing a Business and Commerce degree.

He said that he did not have alcohol at dinner that night and had not taken any kind of drug or medication.""

9Under the heading ""Psychiatric History"" Dr Nielssen stated (inter alia) as follows (at page 2):

""Mr Iskandar said that he had counselling after he left school during year eleven, and a psychologist named Mr Wood came to his house. He said that he was ""burnt out"" and it was ""too much of a burden to finish school"".

Mr Iskandar said that he was not diagnosed with any condition or advised to have any kind of medication or other treatment.

Mr Iskandar said that he was referred to a psychiatrist in prison who initiated treatment with an antidepressant medication, whose name he could not remember. He said that it had helped a little bit.

In response to questions about symptoms of mental illness, Mr Iskandar said that he had felt as though he wanted to die as a teenager between the ages of fourteen and eighteen because of the pressure placed on him by his parents. He said my Dad didn't give me options...he just said ""listen to me"". 

He said he attempted suicide on one occasion by attempting to hang himself in jail, but was stopped from doing so by his cell mate"".

10Having diagnosed a depressive illness which was in partial remission, Dr Nielssen, under the heading ""Opinion"", said (at page 4):

""The diagnosis of a depressive illness is made on the basis of Mr Iskandar's account of symptoms of depression, including suicidal ruminations and a suicide attempt by hanging. The disorder was described as being in partial remission, on the basis of his presentation during the recent interview, when he did not appear especially depressed.

He reported receiving treatment with an antidepressant medication prescribed by a psychiatrist at Parklea Correctional Centre, which has probably contributed to the remission from symptoms.

There was no history of any kind of developmental disorder, learning disorder, any pattern of antisocial conduct, and no history of substance abuse. Mr Iskandar reported feeling depressed during his adolescence because of the pressure applied by his parents and the continued physical abuse, especially by his father. However, he did not report being depressed around the time of the offence or having symptoms of any other psychiatric disorder at that time.

Mr Iskandar reported being frightened of his father as a result of the experience of physical abuse during his upbringing and feeling compelled to obey his father's orders. Based on the account provided by Mr Iskandar, it seems likely that he committed the offence in part because he was obliged to his father and afraid of him.""

11The second report tendered on behalf of the applicant on sentence was that of Sam Borenstein, clinical psychologist. Part of the history recorded by Mr Borenstein was as follows (commencing at page 2):

""I asked Mr Iskandar to describe his childhood. He paused and responded, ""not so good"". I asked him to elaborate, ""a lot of arguments, conflicts, sometimes"". Mr Iskandar states there were rare happy occasions ""mainly bad times"". Mr Iskandar's parents frequently fought, and there were occasions when police were called to the house (as) the result of fighting between his parents. Mr Iskandar states his father was never charged by police with domestic violence offences, 'my mother said she would take an AVO, but she didn't"".
Mr Iskandar confirmed his parents also beat him physically. Mr Iskandar offered examples of the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents through childhood and adolescence. Mr Iskandar recalls falling asleep whilst studying, and his mother hit him with a broomstick leaving bruises on his person. Mr Iskandar says this incident occurred when he was aged about 12, and again when he was hit with a wooden mirror. Mr Iskandar states his mother punched him to the head without explanation on one occasion when he was purchasing fish and chips at Campsie for lunch, as he had not had any breakfast on his way to religious classes.

Of some concern is the allegation that Mr Iskandar's mother repeatedly checked his genitals, ""to see if it was up and hard, to see if it was healthy"". Mr Iskandar says he objected to this behaviour which occurred between the age of 10 and 18. Mr Iskandar says his mother would demand he ask her permission to go to the toilet if she was present. Mr Iskandar was not able to offer an explanation for his mother's behaviour.

Mr Iskandar states his father was equally threatening. Mr Iskandar was fearful of both parents, more so his father. Mr Iskandar says his father threatened to ""smash my head in with a metal pole, and there would be blood all over the floor"". 

Mr Iskandar recalls when aged about 15, his father acting as if he was stabbing Mr Iskandar with a screw driver and laughing. Mr Iskandar states his father was controlling, demanding, and very strict in his demeanour. Mr Iskandar confirmed he has a scar near his right eye from when his father punched him when aged 11. Mr Iskandar states if he disobeyed his father in any way or did not comply with his father's demands, he would be subject to verbal and at times physical abuse. 

...

At the age of 16, Mr Iskandar says he became suicidal. He tied clothing around his neck with the idea of hanging himself, ""I stopped myself"". Mr Iskandar made an attempt at hanging himself in Long Bay Correctional Centre since imprisoned, ""my cellmate stopped me"". Mr Iskandar consulted a psychiatrist in prison and is currently on antidepressant medication, which he named as Lexapro 10 mg per day"".

12Mr Borenstein thought that the applicant's mood was depressed at the time of his examination. However, he could find no suggestion of any serious psychiatric disorder such as a psychosis. He considered that the applicant's thoughts were normal and that there was no evidence of perceptual disturbance.

13Under the heading ""Opinion"" Mr Borenstein acknowledged having read the report of Dr Nielssen before stating (commencing at page 6):
""Mr Iskandar was subject to an abusive, dysfunctional family, where he was frequently subject to verbal and physical abuse, and sexual abuse at the hands of his mother. Such a pattern of abuse extended through childhood and adolescence, impacts significantly on psychological development and underpins Mr Iskandar's depressive disorder and propensity towards anxiety. 

...

Mr Iskandar's account of his relationship with both parents, particularly his father, confirms a pattern of compliance with his father's demands, and it is highly unlikely Mr Iskandar would ever disobey his father.

I concur with Dr Nielssen's observation of page 4 of the report dated 26 January 2012, ""it seems likely that he committed the offence in part because he was obliged to his father and afraid of him.""

The sentence proceedings 
14Counsel who appeared for the applicant on sentence made the following submission in relation to the medical evidence (at T17):

""Your Honour will note from Dr Nielssen's report that the offender has been suffering depression for some time. He is now receiving treatment, he is on medication, but your Honour in my submission may take into account that factor when your Honour is considering general deterrence. For example, a person suffering from a mental health problem such as depression may not be an appropriate vehicle to use to impose a significant general deterrence factor into the sentence. 

Where the Crown says that he was not under any mental health problem at the time of committing the offence it appears that the psychiatrist may well take issue with that based on the history of the offender, Andrew Iskandar.""

15It was not submitted to his Honour that the medical evidence established a causal link between the applicant's depression and his offending, such that his mental state was relevant to an assessment of his moral culpability. 

The findings of the sentencing judge
16Having noted (at [45]-[51]) various inconsistencies in the applicant's accounts to Dr Nielssen and Mr Borenstein, his Honour said:

""52. Despite the inconsistencies in the histories I accept the conclusion of Dr Nielssen and Mr Borenstein that Andrew has suffered from a depressive illness for which he is still being treated. Mr Borenstein attributes this largely to the verbal and physical abuse he was subjected to as a child. 

53 The significant conclusion to which Dr Nielssen came was that, based on the account provided by Andrew: 

'It seems likely that he committed the offence in part because he was obliged to his father and afraid of him.' 

Mr Borenstein said that he concurred with this observation. 

54 The difficulty about this conclusion is that it was not consistent, for the large part, with the evidence that Andrew gave during the trial. Certainly he was in the car with his father at Cromwell Street, Leichhardt, although, on his account of things, that was by a mutual arrangement for a driving lesson, at least up until the time his father commenced driving after dinner. Thereafter the only evidence he gave of doing anything at his father's behest was hitting the Deceased with the hammer after he (Andrew) had voluntarily come to his father's assistance, and ringing Victor Lau to arrange a false alibi. He gave no evidence that his father required him to take part in the killing of the Deceased nor to do other than strike him the one blow with the hammer. He did not suggest in any way to Mr Lau nor Mr Maiava that he had acted at his father's behest when he described to them what had happened. Indeed, what I conclude from their evidence is that he (Andrew) wanted to deal with the Deceased because he could not handle the idea of his mother having an affair with the Deceased. 

55 I can accept, however, that his father is likely to have been the moving influence in what was arranged and perpetrated. On all of the psychiatric and psychological evidence his father was a dominant and controlling man, and Andrew was to some extent scared of him, and certainly scared of incurring his displeasure. On the balance of probabilities I find that Andrew followed his father's lead in what was done by reason of the unequal relationship. Nevertheless, I find beyond reasonable doubt that Andrew's own motive in acting as he did coincided with his father's motive. 

56 Nothing that appears in the reports of Dr Nielssen and Mr Borenstein justifies the conclusion that they reach. The conclusion is contrary to all of the evidence in the case. I find beyond reasonable doubt that Andrew's involvement in the murder was not as a result of any direction, order or pressure from his father or any feeling of obligation to him. ""

17As to general deterrence his Honour said (at [90]-[92]):

""90 In assessing its objective seriousness wholly by reference to the nature of the offending, the murder in the present case must be regarded as a serious and brutal one aggravated by the weapons used, the fact that it was committed in company, and the extended period of the assault. 

91 If one adds into the synthesis the motive for the murder, its overall seriousness is increased. This murder has been described as an honour killing. So to describe it invests with it a degree of legitimacy that it does not, and can never, have. No society or culture that regards itself as civilised can tolerate to any extent, or make any allowance for, the killing of another person for such an amorphous concept as honour. Further, the whole basis and origin of honour killings is the notion that a woman is the chattel or possession of a man, whether her father, her husband, or some other patriarchal figure. Such a notion has no place in this country. 

92 The motive for this murder means that general deterrence assumes some importance in the determination of the sentence."" 

Submissions of the parties
18Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that having accepted that the applicant suffered from a depressive illness, his Honour had erred in failing to take into account that fact on sentence. That error was said to have arisen in one of two ways.

19Firstly, senior counsel submitted that on the evidence which was before his Honour, it had been open to him to find that there was a causal link between the applicant's diagnosed depressive illness and his offending. It was submitted that his Honour's failure to reach such a finding, and the related failure to have regard to the impact of the applicant's depression upon his moral culpability, amounted to error. In advancing that argument senior counsel acknowledged that no submission had been put to the sentencing judge that the evidence supported such causal link. However, it was submitted that the issue of the applicant's mental state had certainly been raised in a general sense, and that his Honour was therefore required to consider all of the evidence and make such findings as were supported by it. 

20It was also acknowledged by senior counsel for the applicant that Dr Nielssen had specifically noted that the applicant did not report being depressed around the time of the offence, and did not report having had symptoms of any other psychiatric disorder at that time. However, senior counsel submitted that those observations were not determinative of the issue of whether there was a causal link between the applicant's depression and his offending. It was submitted that the whole of the medical evidence demonstrated that there was a complex interplay of factors impacting upon the applicant's mental state, and that the reported absence of any symptoms of depression at the time of the offending could be explained by the fact that the applicant had limited (or perhaps no) insight into his condition, or into the factors which gave rise to it. 

21The second submission advanced on behalf of the applicant in support of this ground was that even if a conclusion were reached that the evidence did not establish the causal link to which we have referred, the applicant's depressive condition nevertheless remained relevant to considerations of general deterrence (see R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67). It was submitted that his Honour's failure to take the applicant's mental state into account on that question demonstrated error. 

22The Crown submitted that the evidence was not sufficient to establish any causal link between the applicant's depression and his offending, and that accordingly, the issue of the impact of the applicant's mental state upon his moral culpability simply did not arise. In this respect the Crown emphasised the manner in which the case was conducted by counsel for the applicant on sentence, and particularly emphasised the fact that no submission was made to his Honour, in the context of the medical evidence, about matters which might be relevant to an assessment of the applicant's moral culpability. 

23The Crown accepted that it was not necessary for the applicant to demonstrate a causal link between his depressive condition and his offending in order to have that condition taken into account on the question of general deterrence. The Crown also accepted that his Honour had not taken into account the applicant's depression on that question. However, the Crown submitted that his Honour's failure to do so did not demonstrate error. In this regard, the Crown pointed to paragraphs [90] - [92] of his Honour's judgment and submitted that the reasons why his Honour concluded that general deterrence remained a relevant consideration were clearly set out. 

Consideration and conclusion 
24As was acknowledged by senior counsel for the applicant, it was not submitted by counsel who appeared on sentence that the medical evidence supported the existence of a causal link between the applicant's depression and his offending. Generally speaking, a party will be bound by counsel's conduct of proceedings at first instance (see generally Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [79]-[80] per Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreeing). In Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Hammerschlag J agreeing) said (at [36]):

""The approach reflected in Zreika v R at [80]-[81] has been emphasised and applied by this Court, in circumstances where reliance was sought to be placed on appeal upon aspects of an offender's mental disorder which had been expressly eschewed by counsel at first instance: BT v R [2012] NSWCCA 128 at [20]-[26].""


25In any event, we are not satisfied that the evidence before his Honour did support the finding for which the applicant now contends. Dr Nielssen noted that the applicant did not report being depressed at the time of the offending, and that he did not report having had any symptom of any other psychiatric disorder at that time. Mr Borenstein said nothing to the contrary. There was no other evidence before his Honour which touched upon the issue. The submission which was put to his Honour by counsel then appearing for the applicant was one which was completely consistent with the evidence. 

26It follows that there was no error arising from his Honour's failure to find that there was a causal link between the applicant's depression and his offending which affected the assessment of moral culpability.

27There remains the question of whether his Honour erred in failing to take into account the applicant's depression on the question of general deterrence. In the course of submissions, senior counsel for the applicant took the Court to a passage from the judgment of Allen J in Engert (supra) where his Honour made a number of observations as to the relevance, to general deterrence, of a mental disorder where that mental disorder did not play a causative role in the offending. His Honour said (at 72):

""The Chief Justice has indicated that even in that circumstance the existence of the mental disorder can be relevant to general deterrence. The cases to which the Chief Justice has referred are all cases dealing with mental disorder of some sort, whether it be deficiency in intellect or some psychiatric disorder. However, the general principles of sentencing in relation to taking into account general deterrence are no different, in respect of mental disorder, than they are in respect of any other characteristic of an offender which might make it inappropriate that he receive a full measure of punishment which reflects the need for general deterrence. 

General deterrence is simply the deterrence of others and characteristics personal to an offender might make him an unpersuasive vehicle for the deterrence of others in the sight of those others. It must be emphasised that general deterrence is directed to deterring others. So one must look to the impact upon others. Even in a case where an offender has a mental disability which is unrelated to the commission of the crime the sympathy which his condition must attract in the eyes of others in the community generally may be such that to sentence him with full weight given to general deterrence might have no impact at all upon others"".

28Importantly, in the same case, Gleeson CJ said (at 68):
""A moment's consideration will show that the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex and on occasion even intricate. In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration. For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. That was the particular problem being examined by the Court in the case of Veen (No 2). Again, in a particular case, a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence, might, at the same time increase the importance of deterrence of the offender.

It is therefore erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances. In every case, what is called for is the making of a discretionary decision in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, and in the light of the purposes to be served by the sentencing exercise"".

29The decision in Engert was referred to by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194 where his Honour made the following observations (at 177; [43]):

[177] Where an offender is suffering from a mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems the courts have developed principles to be applied when sentencing: see, eg, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Tsiarias [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40] - [48]; Lauritsen v R [2000] WASCA 203; (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [43] - [51]; R v Harb [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35] - [45]; R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] - [36]; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32]; Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195 at [14]-[18]; and R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28]. They can be summarised in the following manner: 

● Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]; Miller v R [1999] WASCA 66 at [23]; R v Jiminez [1999] WASCA 7 at [23], [25]; Tsiaras at 400; Lauritsen at [51]; Israil at [23]; R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129 at [43]; Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 at [28].● It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed: Engert at 71; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50 - 51; Israil at [22]; Pearson at [42]; Henry at [28].● It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced: Tsiaris at 400; Jiminez at [25]; Israil at [26]; Henry at [28].● It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence: Courtney at [14]; Tsiaras at 400; Israil at [25]; JW at [192].
● Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence: Israil at [24]; Henry at [28]. Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public: R v Lawrence (2005) NSWCCA 91 per Spigelman CJ at [23] - [24].

[178] I should stress that the mental health problems of an offender need not amount to a serious psychiatric illness before they will be relevant to the sentencing process. The circumstances may indicate that when an offender has a mental disorder of modest severity it may nevertheless be appropriate to moderate the need for general or specific deterrence: R v Skura [2004] VSCA 53; R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102; (2007) 16 VR 269 at [5].

30Clearly, an offender's mental illness may be relevant to the question of general deterrence even where that illness was not causally related to the offending. However, for the reasons explained by Gleeson CJ in Engert, it would be erroneous to approach the matter on the basis that once the mental illness of an offender is established, it will automatically follow that general deterrence will assume less importance in determining the appropriate sentence. Whether that is the case will depend upon the entire circumstances of the particular case. 

31In the present case, his Honour explained in some detail (at [91]-[92]) why he considered that principles of general deterrence remained a relevant consideration on sentence. The matters he took into account in coming to that view were specific to the present case. They included the applicant's motive. They also included the background to the deceased's murder, and what his Honour saw as the necessity to make it clear that so called honour killings have no place in the community. Those were clearly relevant factors in his Honour's determination.

32In our view, his Honour's approach in these respects did not reflect error.

33This ground is therefore not made out. 

Ground 3 - There is erroneous disparity between the sentence of the applicant and the sentence subsequently imposed upon the co-offender, his father.

The sentence imposed upon the co-offender 

34The sentence imposed by his Honour upon the applicant's father has been noted at [4] above. 

35In imposing that sentence, his Honour found (at [51] and following) that the applicant's father was genuinely remorseful. When sentencing the applicant, his Honour had found (at [68]) that there was no evidence that the applicant had demonstrated any remorse. 

36Further, when sentencing the applicant's father his Honour (at [60]) applied a discount of 10% to reflect what he viewed as a willingness on the part of the applicant's father to facilitate the course of justice. In this regard his Honour noted that the plea of guilty to manslaughter by the applicant's father, although it was rejected by the Crown, nonetheless had the effect of considerably narrowing the issues at the trial. These considerations were not relevant to the sentence of the applicant. 

37Having made those findings in the case of the applicant's father, his Honour said (commencing g at [63]):

""63 I sentenced Andrew Iskandar on 16 March 2012 for his part in the murder to a non-parole period of 18 years with an additional term of 7 years. I made a small adjustment for special circumstances because of his age, lack of criminal record and prospects of rehabilitation.

64 The differences of significance between the present Offender and Andrew Iskandar are twofold. First, is what I have found to be the genuine remorse of the present Offender. I found that Andrew Iskandar expressed no remorse. Secondly, the present Offender is to be given a discount for his plea.

65 I gave some consideration to Andrew's youth and in the same way I give some consideration to the present Offender's more advanced years. Partly because of the age of the present Offender, his obvious remorse and the victim-specific nature of the crime, rehabilitation is not an important factor here. Those matters also mean that he is unlikely to be a danger to the general public in the way that those who kill randomly or concomitantly with the commission of property or drug offences are such a danger.

66 As at Andrew's trial the evidence at the present trial suggests the present Offender was the moving influence in what was arranged and perpetrated. The evidence also demonstrated, however, that their culpability in the execution of the crime cannot be differentiated. Both employed savage and brutal force with the weapon each wielded.""


Submissions of the parties
38Senior counsel for the applicant emphasised that although there were differentiating subjective features between the two cases, the sentencing judge had nevertheless made a number of important findings, when sentencing the applicant, about the applicant's relationship with his father. Those findings included:

(i)that the applicant's father was likely to have been the moving influence in what was arranged and perpetrated (at [55]); and 

(ii)that the applicant's father was a dominant and controlling man of whom the applicant was, to some extent, scared (at [55]).

39It was submitted that the influence of the applicant's father was reflected in the fact that he had played a more significant role in the deceased's murder. In this regard senior counsel pointed to the fact that the actions of the applicant's father included: 

(i)following his wife and the deceased on a number of occasions;

(ii)organising the rental of the car;

(iii)placing weapons in the vehicle;

(iv)driving to the vicinity of the deceased's home on the night of the murder;

(v)ramming the deceased's car;

(vi)alighting from the car and initiating the altercation with the deceased;

(vii)chasing the deceased and stabbing him in the back and chest (the latter causing the fatal wound).

40It was submitted that these matters demonstrated that the culpability of the applicant's father was greater than that of the applicant, and that this assumed even greater significance when assessed against the background of the relationship between them. 

41For all of these reasons, it was submitted that the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance having regard to the respective sentences which were imposed. 

42In response, the Crown firstly pointed to the fact that the same judge had sentenced both the applicant and his father. The Crown submitted, by reference to various authorities, that it was important to bear in mind that when it came to sentencing the applicant's father, his Honour was obviously fully aware of the facts surrounding the death of the deceased, of the findings he had made in respect of the applicant, and of the sentence which he had imposed upon the applicant. These circumstances, it was submitted, rendered it necessary for this Court to adopt a cautious approach in considering whether the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance. 

43The Crown further submitted that it was evident from his Honour's remarks when sentencing the applicant's father (at [63] - [66]) that he had given close consideration to the issue of parity and had explained why it was that he had chosen to depart from the sentence he had previously imposed upon the applicant. In this regard, the Crown pointed, in particular, to his Honour's specific reference to what he had identified as the two subjective features which served to differentiate the position of the applicant from that of his father. 


44The Crown also relied upon his Honour's finding as to the time at which the joint criminal enterprise between the applicant and his father had commenced, and what had occurred thereafter. It was submitted that although the applicant's father had, prior to that time, followed his wife and the deceased, and had also hired the car which was used to drive to the scene of the murder, there was little to differentiate between the culpability of the applicant's father and the applicant once the joint criminal enterprise had been entered into. 

45The Crown also pointed to the fact that his Honour had in fact adopted a starting point in the case of the applicant's father which was higher than that adopted in the case of the applicant. The ultimate imposition of a lower sentence in the case of the applicant's father was, the Crown submitted, simply a result of the application of the differentiating factors which his Honour had identified. 

46In all of these circumstances, the Crown submitted that no justifiable sense of grievance arose. 



Consideration and conclusion 
47In Green v R; Quinn v R (2011) 244 CLR 462 the plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) observed (at [28], citations omitted):

""Consistency in the punishment of offences against the criminal law is ""a reflection of the notion of equal justice"" and ""is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice"". It finds expression in the ""parity principle"" which requires that like offenders should be treated in a like manner. As with the norm of ""equal justice"", which is its foundation, the parity principle allows for different sentences to be imposed upon like offenders to reflect different degrees of culpability and/or different circumstances.""

48Their Honours (at 474; [31]) then referred to the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610 where the Chief Justice said:

""The reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done.""

49Their Honours went on to observe (at [31] - [32]):

""The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.

A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders. Where there is a marked disparity between sentences giving rise to the appearance of injustice, it is not a necessary condition of a court of criminal appeal's discretion to intervene that the sentence under appeal is otherwise excessive... Unjustifiable disparity is an infringement of the equal justice norm. It is appealable error, although it may not always lead to an appeal being allowed. If an appeal is allowed on the ground of disparity, a court of criminal appeal in re-sentencing is not required to achieve identity of punishment. It must have regard to the sentence imposed on the co-offender and give it appropriate weight.""

50In sentencing the applicant his Honour made a number of important findings which are relevant to this ground.

51Firstly, his Honour found (at [7]) that the applicant's father had set relevant matters in train at least one week prior to the deceased's murder. Consistent with that finding, his Honour also found (at [55]) that the applicant's father was likely to have been the moving influence in what had taken place, and that the applicant had followed him. 

52However, his Honour (at [54]) specifically rejected the proposition that the applicant had committed the offence because he was obliged to his father and was afraid of him. He did so at least partly on the basis that it was not consistent with evidence given by the applicant at his trial. Having heard the entirety of that evidence, his Honour was obviously placed in the best possible position to assess it in the context of the opinions expressed by Dr Nielssen and Mr Borenstein. 

53Importantly, his Honour found when sentencing the applicant (at [30]) that the joint criminal enterprise in which the applicant and his father were engaged had commenced no later than when they left home on the night of the murder. As to what had then occurred in terms of the offending, his Honour found that: 
(i)the applicant and his father each wore a dark hooded jacket (at [13]);

(ii)the applicant knew, before travelling to the murder scene with his father, that there were weapons in the car, at least in the form of a knife and a hammer (although the applicant did not put them there) (at [13]);

(iii)the applicant and his father intended that those weapons would be used on the deceased (at [13]);

(iv)the applicant and his father exited their vehicle after it had rammed that of the deceased (at [15]);

(v)upon exiting the vehicle, the applicant was in possession of a hammer and his father was in possession of a knife (at [15]);

(vi)both the applicant and his father chased the deceased (at [15]);

(vii)having caught up with the deceased, both the applicant and his father kicked him (at [17]);

(viii)the applicant bashed the deceased with a hammer in a manner akin to ""bashing a piece of meat"" whilst his father stood to one side holding a knife which was then used to inflict the fatal wound (at [18]).

54None of those findings were challenged by the applicant on the hearing the present appeal.

55His Honour also accepted the evidence given in the course of the trial by a Mr Maiava, who was called by the Crown to give evidence of a conversation he had with the applicant relating to the deceased's murder. In this regard his Honour said (at [27]):

""I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Andrew told Mr Maiava that he and his father planned to kill the Deceased, that they had to wait until they knew when the Deceased arrived home from work, that they went to the vicinity of the Deceased's house on the night in question to await his arrival, that when he arrived home Hazairin drove into the Deceased's car, that the Deceased got out of his car to run away and that both Hazairin and Andrew attacked and killed him, Hazairin with a knife and Andrew with a hammer. I accept that Andrew told Mr Maiava that he did it because his mother was having an affair and he couldn't handle that fact."" 


56Again, those findings were not challenged by the applicant. 

57All of these considerations led his Honour to reach the following conclusion when sentencing the applicant (at [98]):

""In light of the facts that I have found, including the repeated blows that were struck by Andrew with the hammer, I do not consider that there was less culpability simply because it was Hazairin's action that ultimately killed the Deceased. That may have been serendipitous"".

58There is no doubt that, as his Honour found, the applicant's father had ""set matters in train"" at least a week prior to the deceased's murder. There is equally no doubt that he hired the car which was used to drive to the murder scene. However, bearing in mind his Honour's findings as to what was done by the applicant and his father after the joint criminal enterprise had been entered into, there was little to differentiate their respective culpability. 

59Further, and although it is not possible to determine the precise starting point which his Honour adopted when sentencing the applicant's father, it is evident that it was higher than the sentence which was ultimately imposed upon the applicant. The adoption of a higher starting point was an approach which was consistent with his Honour's conclusion that the applicant's father was the moving influence, and had set things in train. The sentence which was ultimately imposed upon the applicant's father by his Honour reflects the fact that having started at a higher point, his Honour then took into account the two differentiating features which he had identified, namely remorse and a demonstrated willingness to facilitate the course of justice. 

60Moreover, it has been observed that whilst differentiation in culpability amongst co-offenders in a joint criminal enterprise is often appropriate, there are limits to which this can occur. Differences in subjective circumstances will, however, result in differences in the end result. Sometimes those differences will be significant (see R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49 at [166] per Spigelman CJ).

61Finally, it is important to bear in mind that his Honour sentenced both the applicant and his father. This Court has long recognised the importance of that circumstance when dealing with issues of parity. In R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 Barr and Howie JJ said at [71]:

""This was a case where the sentencing of both offenders was by the same judge on the same occasion. Where the same judge sentences two offenders at the same time and gives detailed reasons for imposing the sentences he did by having regard to the differing criminality of each, the differing subjective circumstances and the relevant sentencing principles, in our view this Court should be cautious before determining that one of the offenders has a justifiable sense of grievance just because of the different sentencing outcomes"".


62That passage was cited with approval in Pavicevic v R [2010] ACTCA 25 at [21]. Similar views have been expressed in a number of other cases, both in this Court and elsewhere. Those cases include Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398; R v Spizzerri [2001] VSCA 49; Dwayhi v R; Bechara v R [2011] NSWCCA 67; (2011) 205 A Crim R 274; and Gill v R [2010] NSWCCA 236. In Gill McColl JA (with whom RS Hulme and Latham JJ agreed) said (at [58]): 

""Finally, it should be understood that considerable obstacles are faced by an applicant seeking to invoke the parity principle in circumstances where the sentencing judge was fully aware of sentences imposed upon a co-offender, and the reasons for those sentences, and indicates in the sentencing remarks why the judge is departing from the co-offender's sentences.""

63In all of these circumstances we do not consider that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance. It follows that this ground has not been made out. 





Ground 2 - The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive
Submissions of the parties
64In support of this ground, senior counsel for the applicant placed significant reliance upon the applicant's youth. It was submitted that although the applicant was an adult at the time he committed the offence, his level of maturity (or lack thereof) was required to be assessed in the context of the background to his offending, an important component of which was his relationship with his father. It was submitted that the applicant's relative youth and his father's dominating and controlling influence were factors which deserved more weight in the sentencing process.

65Senior counsel acknowledged the obvious seriousness of the offending, and the fact that it involved planning and a distinct motive. However, it was submitted that it was necessary to balance those matters against the important subjective factors which were relied upon. Counsel also referred the Court to relevant sentencing statistics which, it was submitted, demonstrated that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 

66The Crown submitted that his Honour had properly assessed the objective criminality of the applicant's offending and had given proper consideration to relevant mitigating factors. The Crown also stressed the seriousness of the offence, and pointed to the fact that his Honour had obviously taken into account the relevant legislative guide posts of the maximum penalty of imprisonment for life and the standard non-parole of 20 years. 

67In terms of the applicant's reliance upon statistics, the Crown specifically referred to the observations of the High Court in Hili v R, Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 as to the limitations which are necessarily placed upon the use of such material. In this regard, the Crown pointed out that the statistics relied upon by the applicant included those applicable to offenders who had pleaded guilty, and whose sentences where therefore obviously less. It was submitted that when the statistics in respect of those offenders who had pleaded not guilty were considered, they did not demonstrate manifest excess in the sentence. 

Consideration and conclusion 
68As we have previously noted, although his Honour concluded (at [56]) that the applicant followed his father's lead, he also found that the applicant was not directed, ordered or pressured by his father to become involved. He also found that the applicant's involvement did not come about as a result of a feeling of obligation on his part towards his father, and that the applicant had his own motive in acting as he did. His Honour took that relationship into account (at [97]) to the degree that he considered appropriate, bearing in mind his earlier findings. 

69His Honour made specific reference (at [96] and again at [101]) to the applicant's youth. It is clear from those references that his Honour took that issue into account, along with the applicant's lack of criminal record and his prospects of rehabilitation. 

70The applicant's subjective circumstances were necessarily required to be balanced against the nature of the offending. In this regard, his Honour concluded (at [90]) that the serious and brutal nature of the offending was aggravated by the use of weapons, that the offending was committed in company, and that it involved an extended period of assault. In our view, all of these matters justified his Honour's categorisation of the offending (at [96]) as a grave crime. This is particularly so in circumstances where his Honour found that it had been executed with an intention to kill.

71In order to establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive an applicant must demonstrate that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust (see Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321; [2000] HCA 54 at 325; [6]). Taking into account the seriousness of the offending as his Honour described it, and bearing in mind his Honour's express references to the applicant's subjective circumstances, we do not consider that the applicant has established that the sentence imposed on him is unreasonable or plainly unjust.

72Accordingly, this ground is not made out.

Ground 4 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the time that the applicant spent in custody in Singapore.
The sentencing judge's reasons 
73When sentencing the applicant, and having concluded that the appropriate sentence was a minimum term of 18 years imprisonment with an additional term of 7 years, his Honour said (at [102]:

""He has been in custody since his arrest in Singapore on 21 May 2010. His sentence will commence on that day.""

Submissions of the parties
74It was common ground that the applicant had been taken into custody in Singapore on 24 February 2010, at which time he was detained pending extradition to Australia. He arrived back in Australia on 21 May 2010 and was charged with the deceased's murder upon his arrival. Accordingly, to the extent that his Honour concluded that the applicant had ""been in custody since his arrest in Singapore on 21 May 2010"" he was in error.

Consideration and conclusion 
75It is apparent that his Honour intended to commence the sentence on and from the date on which the applicant was taken into custody in Singapore, namely 24 February 2010. Accordingly, this ground is made out.

76It is appropriate for this Court to intervene and adjust the applicant's sentence to commence on 24 February 2010.

ORDERS
77In view of the forgoing the orders of the court are as follows:

(i)leave to appeal against sentence granted; 

(ii)appeal allowed;

(iii)in lieu of the sentence imposed on 16 March 2012, the applicant is sentenced to a minimum term of 18 years imprisonment commencing on 24 February 2010 and expiring on 23 February 2028 with an additional term of 7 years expiring on 23 February 2035.

2420546,"TIMMIS, Michael Anthony v R [2013] NSWCCA 240","Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: Michael Anthony Timmis (the applicant) was arraigned on 8 February 2010 on the following five counts:

(i) Between 27 February and 30 March 2009 at Campbelltown and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales did conspire with Dean Michael Rose and Ronald Edwin Goulding, to rob the manager of the Campsie RSL Club Limited, of a sum of money, the property of Campsie RSL Club Limited and to do so while armed with a dangerous weapon.

(ii) On 30 March 2009 at Campsie in the State of New South Wales was armed with a weapon, namely, an imitation Colt self loading pistol with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely, robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon.

(iii) On 30 March 2009 at Campsie in the State of New South Wales did possess a prohibited weapon, namely, an imitation Colt self loading pistol without being authorised to do so by a permit.

(iv) On 30 March 2009 at Campsie in the State of New South Wales had in his possession, without lawful excuse, an implement of housebreaking, namely a jemmy bar.

(v) On 30 March 2009 at Campsie in the State of New South Wales had in his possession the means of disguising his face, namely a balaclava, with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely robbery armed with a dangerous weapon.

2Following a trial at which the applicant was represented by counsel, he was convicted by a jury on Counts 1, 2, 3 and 5. He was sentenced on 13 August 2010 to a total effective sentence of seven years with an effective non-parole period of five years and three months.

3The applicant appeals against his conviction.

4As the grounds of appeal involve questions of mixed fact and law, leave of the Court to appeal is required and has not been sought. However, no point is taken by the Crown and in the circumstances leave should be granted.

The trial

5The case presented by the Crown at trial relied on the evidence of an informer, electronic surveillance and ultimately physical surveillance. The Crown filed a summary of trial which summarised the evidence. I have checked the summary against the transcript of evidence in the Court below and the transcripts of the electronic surveillance which were tendered in evidence and I am satisfied that the summary is generally accurate.

6On 2 March 2009 a person identified only as the informer attended Campbelltown Police Station and told police that he wished to speak to detectives about an armed robbery that he was aware was being planned. The informer gave evidence that he socialised and played poker with the applicant and a Mr Ronald Goulding at venues including the Wests Leagues Club in Campbelltown. Mr Goulding had been a sub-manager of the Campsie RSL Club but had lost his job in about late August 2008.

7The informer gave evidence that during a conversation around six months prior to March 2009, Mr Goulding stated that the Campsie RSL Club would be an easy location at which to commit a robbery and that he was a past manager. However, the informer said that the conversation was not taken seriously and no plans were put in place to carry out a robbery at that time. 

8The informer gave evidence that on the last Friday in February 2009 he was contacted by the applicant by phone. The applicant said that he was desperate for money and the informer suggested that he should rob an ATM or the Campsie RSL Club. The applicant replied ""Yeah, that's a great idea"" and within 10 minutes arrived at the informer's house. The informer and the applicant then attended Mr Goulding's house at Bradbury where the proposed robbery was discussed in further detail. 

9The informer gave evidence that Mr Goulding explained that the best time to rob the RSL Club was 5.00am on a Monday. This was because there would be more money as a result of the takings from the weekend. Mr Goulding told them that there would be a minimum of about $120,000 and closer to between $300,000 and $500,000 if there was a public holiday. 

10Later on 2 March 2009 the informer again met with police. The informer gave evidence that following his first meeting with police he had contacted Mr Goulding via SMS text message and had gone to Mr Goulding's house and met with the applicant and Mr Goulding. The informer said that Mr Goulding provided a sketch of the floor plan of the Club. Detective Senior Constable Benjamin Walsh gave evidence that the informer showed him the handwritten sketch during the latter meeting on 2 March 2009. 

11As a consequence police conducted a surveillance operation commencing on 3 March 2009. Detective Senior Constable Walsh gave evidence that he participated in a surveillance operation in which the applicant, Mr Goulding and the informer were covertly followed from the Campbelltown area to the Campsie RSL Club. The informer also gave evidence that he, Mr Goulding and the applicant travelled in a Land Cruiser to view the RSL Club so that Mr Goulding could point out the manager's office. They did a number of laps of the Club in the vehicle and then parked in the car park.

12Later on 3 March 2009 Detective Senior Constable Walsh met the informer at Campbelltown Police Station. A statement was obtained from the informer who also provided Mr Goulding's handwritten sketch of the RSL Club. Detective Senior Constable Walsh gave evidence that the informer had not provided the map during their meeting on the previous day as the informer believed that it might be used when they attended the RSL Club. 

13Detective Senior Constable Walsh gave evidence that on 4 March 2009 a surveillance device warrant was granted authorising police to use a number of listening and surveillance devices. Variations of the warrant were applied for and granted on 19 March and 27 March 2009. In addition, Detective Senior Constable Walsh gave evidence that on 2 and 3 March 2009 he compiled an application for authority to conduct a controlled operation pursuant to s 5 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997. The application was granted on 4 March 2009. 

14On 5 March 2009 the informer travelled with the applicant to the RSL Club where they had lunch and conducted observations of the interior layout. Electronic surveillance captured conversations during which the applicant and the informer discussed the plan to commit the robbery. The listening device recording was admitted at the trial as Exhibit C. Detective Senior Constable Walsh gave evidence that when he met the informer later that day to remove the device, the informer gave him a sign in slip and meal receipt from the RSL Club. These documents were admitted as Exhibit D.

15On 6 March 2009 the informer had a telephone conversation with the applicant in which the applicant said ""I've spoken to one bloke about drive, (sic) um doing a bit of driving for us"". A recording of the conversation was admitted at the trial as Exhibit E. 

16On 9 March 2009 the applicant and the informer met at Mr Goulding's residence where Mr Goulding showed them a further sketch of the RSL Club which was admitted as Exhibit F. The informer gave evidence that later that evening he saw the applicant at the Campbelltown Catholic Club where the applicant told him that he had secured a driver. The informer's memory was refreshed by his statement that the applicant told him that the driver's name was Dean. He later came to know the man as Dean Rose. 

17The informer gave evidence of a meeting at a later date in the backyard of his property with the applicant and Mr Rose. The informer reviewed his statement but was unable to identify the date the meeting occurred. The informer gave evidence that he and the applicant were in his backyard. Mr Rose arrived in his car and the applicant said ""Here's our driver"". The informer said that this was the first occasion on which he met Mr Rose. 

18On 20 March 2009 a further telephone conversation took place between the informer and the applicant. A recording of the conversation was admitted at the trial as part of Exhibit E. In the recording the informer stated that he was ""still down at Melbourne"". During the call the applicant stated ""Nah not this Sunday, it's the following Sunday"". He also stated ""I went there last night"" and shortly after, ""I got there at three thirty"" and ""I sort of sat around that to around four"". In his evidence the informer was unable to identify when he arrived back in Sydney from Melbourne. 

19Detective Senior Constable Walsh gave evidence that at about 2.00am on 25 March 2009 he and a number of other officers attended the Leumeah area and met with the informer. He gave the informer a bag containing two black balaclavas and a listening device was attached to the informer. 

20The informer gave evidence that at about 3.30am on 25 March 2009 the applicant and the informer travelled to the Campsie RSL in the applicant's car where a further reconnaissance of the RSL Club was conducted. The informer gave evidence that he and the applicant parked the vehicle and went to a few bushes to look at the entry to the back door of the RSL Club. Electronic surveillance captured the conversation and the recording was admitted at the trial as Exhibit G. 

21The informer gave evidence that on 26 March 2009 he met with Mr Goulding and the applicant at the Leumeah Hotel. Earlier that day he had met with police who fitted another listening device. They travelled to a property belonging to a friend of the applicant and then the applicant dropped Mr Goulding and the informer back at the Leumeah Hotel. Mr Goulding and the informer then returned to the informer's residence. 

22Shortly after the informer returned home, the applicant arrived and parked his truck in the driveway. The informer gave evidence that the passenger side of his truck was opened and a gun was on the floor in a plastic bag. The informer stated that it was black and ""just looked like a police gun"". An electronic recording of events was admitted at the trial as Exhibit H. 

23The informer gave evidence that on 28 March 2009 at the request of the applicant he drove to the applicant's son's workshop in Minto. The applicant was cleaning what appeared to be the same gun that he had seen the previous day. The informer could not recall the nature of their conversation and his memory was refreshed by his statement. The informer stated that 30 per cent of the total was to go to Mr Goulding but there was a suggestion about telling him that there was only $80,000. 

24Detective Senior Constable Walsh gave evidence that he and another officer obtained a Holden Commodore Sedan from a police complex located in Zetland. The vehicle was equipped with a listening device and electronic surveillance equipment. On 29 March 2009 Detective Senior Constable Walsh drove the vehicle to the Whitlam Leisure Centre in Liverpool. He parked the vehicle as he had arranged with the informer.

25On the evening of 29 March 2009 Mr Rose attended the informer's home. Discussions between Mr Rose and the informer were captured by electronic surveillance. They travelled to Liverpool in the informer's car where Mr Rose and the informer collected the white Holden Commodore. Mr Rose drove the Commodore back to the informer's house where they parted company. 

26At 3.30am on 30 March 2009 the applicant met the informer and they drove in the applicant's truck. At some stage they parked on the side of the motorway and transferred materials from the applicant's vehicle into the Holden Commodore. The applicant returned to his vehicle and Mr Rose and the informer travelled in the Commodore. At a point closer to the RSL Club the applicant parked his vehicle and joined the Commodore. The informer gave evidence that Mr Rose was in the driver's seat, the applicant the passenger's seat, while the informer was in the back. They travelled to the rear of the Campsie RSL Club. The informer was fitted with a listening device the recording of which was admitted as Exhibit J. 

27Members of the Tactical Operations Unit arrived while the applicant, Mr Rose and the informer were in the Holden Commodore. Detective Senior Constable Walsh gave evidence that he was in an adjacent street and listened to the arrests as they occurred. When he arrived at the scene the informer, the applicant and Mr Rose were handcuffed outside the vehicle. 

28A Detective Sergeant Andrew Forster was involved in the search of the Holden Commodore and gave evidence at the trial. He gave evidence that he took photographs of items including balaclavas, gloves, a black coloured pistol, cable ties and a jemmy bar. A cable tie was also found in the front passenger seat of the applicant's Land Cruiser. 

29A Mr Clinton Cochrane, senior forensic biologist at the Department of Analytical Laboratories, gave evidence regarding DNA testing conducted in relation to the pistol. He stated that DNA on the pistol grip originated from an unknown male and could not have originated from either Mr Rose or the applicant. The remaining tests on the pistol were unsuccessful. 

30The applicant participated in an electronically recorded interview on 30 March 2009. During the course of this interview the applicant was asked this question and gave this answer:

""Q Are you prepared to tell us what yourself and Dean were doing in the vicinity of the RSL?

A Well, it was Mick organised and um, you know, you know what, so I'm not going to explain anything. I don't need to because you already know it. If you got your informants going around setting people up why do I have to say anything? You know what's, you know what went down.""

31It should be noted that at a later point in the interview the applicant suggested it was a case of entrapment and that he was approached by the informer.

32The Crown's submissions state that Mr Goulding entered a guilty plea on 2 September 2009 to conspiracy to commit armed robbery. Mr Rose was arraigned on the same day as the applicant and entered a plea of guilty to the charge that between 27 February and 30 March 2009 at Campbelltown and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales he did conspire with Dean Michael Rose and Ronald Edwin Goulding, to rob the manager of the Campsie RSL Club Limited, of a sum of money, the property of Campsie RSL Club Limited and to do so while armed with a dangerous weapon. 

33The applicant filed a Notice of Appeal on 28 September 2011. Grounds of appeal were filed on 24 February 2012 and further grounds of appeal were filed on 11 February 2013. It is convenient to deal with the matters raised in the grounds of appeal filed on 24 February 2012 before addressing the matters raised in the further grounds of appeal filed 11 February 2013. 

Ground 1 - The Crown failed to call Ron Goulding because it was aware of his statement dated 30 March 2009

34Mr Goulding did not make a statement on 30 March 2009. However, he participated in a record of interview on that date. He stated in that interview that the applicant and the informer approached him to obtain information about the Campsie RSL Club in late February 2009. He said he became involved because of his financial problems. He claimed he told the applicant and the informer that he did not want to be involved in the robbery itself. He said he knew a firearm was to be used but that the applicant and the informer had promised him no one would be hurt. 

35That evidence would have been of no assistance to the applicant. At the time of the trial of the applicant Mr Goulding had entered a plea of guilty to a charge of conspiracy and was awaiting sentence. Unsurprisingly, the applicant's counsel at the trial did not request Mr Goulding to be called. There was in those circumstances no miscarriage of justice: see R v Kneebone [1999] NSWCCA 279; (1999) 47 NSWLR 450 at [39]-[40].

36The ground of appeal is not made out.

Ground 2 - Improper conduct and abuse of power

37This ground asserts that the evidence of the informer was false and misleading. The informer was called and was cross-examined. The jury was entitled to accept his evidence supported as it was by the surveillance evidence to which I have referred above. 

38This ground of appeal is not made out.

Ground 3 - ""Abuse of power to aid and abet""

39The informer was registered after he supplied the information to the police on 2 March 2009 and a Certificate was subsequently obtained under the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997. However, it was submitted that the Certificate did not extend to the supply of the balaclavas or the motor vehicle to the informer. In those circumstances it was submitted that the evidence of discussions about the vehicle, conversations recorded whilst the applicant and the informer were in the vehicle and the existence of items found in the vehicle should have been excluded as illegally obtained. It was argued at the trial that Detective Senior Constable Walsh had aided and abetted the commission of the offences the subject of Count 1 and Count 5 on the indictment. 

40Whilst doubting whether it was possible to aid and abet a conspiracy, R v Lanteri (1985) 4 NSWLR 359 at 360, the trial judge exercised his discretion under s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 to admit the evidence. This ground does not challenge that decision.

41However, Detective Senior Constable Walsh declined to give evidence unless he was granted a Certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act to protect himself from the consequences of giving evidence which might have incriminated him. No objection was taken to Detective Senior Constable Walsh being given such a Certificate.

42The applicant submitted that there was no power to grant such a Certificate as Detective Senior Constable Walsh was a defendant in the proceedings and by virtue of s 128(10) of the Evidence Act there was no power to grant the Certificate. The basis for this submission apparently was that Detective Senior Constable Walsh was a party to the offences. However, whether or not his conduct involved a criminal offence, he was not a defendant in the proceedings and thus s 128(10) had no application.

43The applicant made the same submission in relation to the Certificate granted to the informer. The informer was not a defendant in the proceedings and the submission is misconceived for the same reason.

44It follows that this ground of appeal is not made out.

Ground 4 - ""Misleading statement""

45The applicant claimed that the jury was misled in that a recording of a conversation between him and the informer of 20 March 2009 was not played in full and, consequently, the jury would have been left with the impression that he rather than the informer had initiated the call.

46The transcript of the conversation was tendered in full. It was described as an incoming call with V1 being the applicant and V2 the informer. The tape of the conversation was also tendered without objection and, as set out above, became Exhibit E in the proceedings. 

47In these circumstances there was no misleading conduct by the Crown at the trial. Further, there was in any event no significance in the question of who instigated the call. The applicant did not identify any such significance.

48It follows that this ground of appeal also is not made out.

The amended Grounds of Appeal

49Before dealing with these grounds it is convenient to provide some additional background.

50The applicant was sentenced on 13 August 2010. He lodged a Notice of Intention to Appeal which was extended on a number of occasions ultimately expiring on 15 October 2011. As set out above, the Notice of Appeal in fact was lodged on 28 September 2011.

51On 26 April 2012 R S Hulme J made orders for the production of various documents to the applicant. On 3 May 2012 a bundle of documents were forwarded to the applicant by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. They included documents described as ""Police Statements in our possession"", ""Intercept transcripts in our possession"" and ""Listening Device transcripts in our possession"". Subsequently a letter was sent on 31 October 2012 enclosing transcripts of 40 SMS text messages intercepted between 7 March 2009 and 30 March 2009.

52The Crown in its submissions acknowledged that a number of documents were destroyed in December 2010. The Crown asserted that the material included additional telephone calls captured under the warrants but whose contents had no relevance to the trial.

53It is these matters which form the subject matter of Grounds 1 and 3 of the Amended Notice of Appeal. It is convenient to deal with them together.

Ground 1 - Non-disclosure of material evidence
Ground 3 - Destruction of evidence in an attempt to pervert the course of justice

54The applicant referred to the fact that there were some 761 telephone calls for the telephone services the subject of intercepts. He complained that he was provided with copies of 28 calls prior to the trial and none after it. He also complained that although there were 12 listening device recordings, he was only provided with five of the recordings prior to the trial. Further, the applicant asserted that the records in his possession show that in the period that telephone intercepts were taking place there were 423 SMS messages for the telephones in question. He stated that he was only provided with one SMS message prior to the trial and 40 thereafter.

55The applicant asserted that in these circumstances the destruction of telephone intercepts and listening device recordings was a destruction of material evidence. The applicant stated that all of the material evidence was not provided to him prior to his trial.

56The difficulty with this submission is that there was nothing to suggest that the destroyed material had any relevance to the proceedings. It was not suggested by the applicant that the 40 SMS messages with which he was supplied after the trial would have affected its course or outcome and absent any evidence that the other material would be relevant, there is nothing to support the allegation of non-disclosure or an attempt to pervert the course of justice by the prosecution authorities.

57In these circumstances these grounds of appeal are not made out.

Ground 2 - Miscarriage of justice by false, misleading and tampered evidence being presented to the jury
Ground 5 - Error in allowing altered material to go to the jury
Ground 6 - The conviction was obtained by fraud

58These grounds relate to the editing of tape recordings obtained as a result of the electronic surveillance prior to the tapes being played to the jury. The applicant claimed that the tapes were not only edited to omit possibly prejudicial material but also cut and spliced.

59The difficulty with this submission is that unedited versions of the electronic material were presented to representatives of the applicant at the trial and a direction made on 3 December 2009 that the applicant's representatives supply all edits of electronic material by 15 January 2010. Although there was non-compliance with this direction, the transcript of the trial of 4 February 2010 reveals that the editing was completed on that day.

60Thus it appears that editing was carried out at the request of the applicant's counsel and there seems no basis for the present complaint.

61Further objection not having been taken at the trial, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies and there has not been shown to be any miscarriage of justice.

62It follows that this ground of appeal has not been established.

Ground 4 - The judge erred in allowing evidence to the jury from the police and informer as a consequence of the Controlled Operations Certificate being invalid

63I have set out the background to this ground in dealing with Ground 3 of the original Notice of Appeal. In this ground, however, complaint is made in relation to the admission of the evidence. However, apart from asserting that the evidence in question was inadmissible, the applicant does not make any submission as to whether and in what manner the exercise by the trial judge of his discretion to admit the evidence under s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 miscarried. 

64The trial judge delivered a judgment on the admissibility of the material on 5 February 2010. In concluding that the evidence should be admitted his Honour took into account all matters required by s 138 and having done so his conclusion, in my opinion, that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting it does not demonstrate any error.

65It follows that this ground of appeal also is not made out.

Ground 7 - Unreliable and perjured evidence of the informer

66This ground is repetitive of Ground 2 in the original Notice of Appeal and should be dismissed for the same reasons.

67The applicant suggested there was a failure by his counsel to follow instructions in cross-examination of the informant. However, somewhat inconsistently, he also submitted that the claimed inconsistencies in the evidence of the informer only came to light after the trial. The applicant declined to waive privilege to allow a statement to be obtained from his counsel and did not seek to give evidence to support the assertions made in this submission.

68I have reviewed the transcript and in my opinion the applicant was competently represented in what, having regard to the surveillance evidence, was a compelling case.

69This ground of appeal is not made out.

Conclusion

70In the result, leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal dismissed.

71FULLERTON J: I agree with the Chief Justice.

72CAMPBELL J: I agree with the Chief Justice.

2420567,Belghar v R [2013] NSWCCA 245,"Judgment
1GLEESON JA:  Ismail Belghar (the applicant) applies for leave to appeal against one of the sentences imposed on him by his Honour Judge Zahra in the District Court at Sydney on 19 October 2012. 
2The applicant had pleaded guilty to two offences when the matter was listed for trial on 8 May 2012, namely:
(1)that the applicant did detain the complainant without her consent and with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely to intimidate the complainant contrary to s 86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (Count 2) - for which the maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 14 years; and 
(2)on the same day, the applicant did assault the complainant contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act (Count 3) - for which the maximum penalty prescribed is 2 years imprisonment. 
3The applicant had pleaded not guilty to an offence of attempted murder by other means (Count 1).  The Crown accepted the applicant's pleas of guilty on the kidnapping and assault counts in full satisfaction of the indictment.
4The individual sentences imposed on the applicant were a term of 4 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months for detaining for advantage and a sentence of 3 months imprisonment for common assault, to be served concurrently.
Ground of appeal
5The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence imposed on the kidnapping count is manifestly excessive.  No complaint is made in respect of the sentence imposed on the assault count. 
Circumstances of the offence
6The sentencing judge proceeded on the basis of a statement of agreed facts. 
7The uncontested facts were that the victim is the sister in law of the applicant, who is married to the victim's older sister.  It was noted in the statement of facts that the applicant and the victim had a somewhat strained relationship, but that there had been no prior confrontations. 
8Approximately two months before the offending, the victim, then aged 22 years, a girlfriend and the applicant's wife (who was 7 years older than the victim) went to the beach together, without the knowledge of the applicant.  When the applicant's wife returned home and told him where she had been, the applicant called the victim and abused her for taking his wife to the beach.  The applicant said words to the effect: 
""You slut ... I'm going to fuck you up ... You fucking slut, how dare you take my wife to the beach"".  
9The applicant's wife, in a statement to police, described the applicant as yelling into the phone and being very angry.  He said to the victim ""Why did you take my wife to the beach you bitch"".  The applicant's wife said that the applicant believed she had worn a bikini to the beach when she in fact had not done so.  She told the police that the applicant did not like her sister.  The statement of facts records that from this time the victim avoided the applicant so as to avoid confrontation.  There was no contact between the applicant and the victim before the date of the offending.
10At around 8.45pm on 22 December 2009, the victim drove to Broadway Shopping Centre in Glebe with her brother and his two daughters.  Upon entering the shopping centre the victim saw the applicant and her sister looking at a store display.  In order to avoid the applicant the victim walked outside the shopping centre to the walkways that led to the car park levels.  The victim's brother and his children went and spoke with the applicant and his wife.  The victim sat on the internal handrail of the walkway facing the entrance of the shopping centre while she waited for the conversation between her brother, the applicant and his wife to end.
11The internal handrail had an additional rail below it that the victim had placed her feet on.  The victim described her position as being similar to sitting on a bar stool but with her knees raised higher.  This internal handrail was approximately 1.5 metres from the external boundary railing of the car park.  The external railing was about 12 metres above the ground.
12While the victim waited she saw the applicant walk away from the group and then suddenly turn to walk quickly towards her.  The applicant had a key in his hand and stood in front of the victim, put his face up to hers and said:
""I'm going to kill you. I'm going to fucking kill you.""  
He then slapped the victim across the left side of her face causing pain and stinging.  This assault was the subject of Count 3.
13The applicant then picked up the victim by putting his hands around the victim's knees and waist, which meant that she was unable to free herself.  The offender carried the victim approximately 1.5 metres to the external boundary railing and held her horizontally over the railing.  The victim's mid-chest upwards was over the railing and she was facing the ground some twelve metres below.  The victim was not sure how long she was held in that position, but in her statement she indicated that it did not feel like it was very long.  This detaining of the victim was the subject of Count 2. 
14While being held over the rail the victim, fearing that the applicant intended to throw her over the railing and that she may die, began screaming and crying uncontrollably.  She then felt her legs become free and she fell to the ground inside the external railing on the walkway.  The victim saw that her brother was now restraining the applicant.  The victim ran into the shopping centre and attempted to get the attention of security guards.  She saw that her brother continued to have a hold on the applicant and was trying to calm him down.  Eventually the applicant was freed and he left the car park. 
15The victim's sunglasses were later found, by police examining the area, on the roadway below the railing where the detention occurred.  An arm of the sunglasses was located on the ground of the walkway within the car park, approximately 30 cm from the exterior boundary railing.
16The statement of facts notes the account of the incident given by the victim's brother.  He observed the applicant approach the victim pointing his keys at the victim and then lifting her from the internal handrail in a ""scooping motion"".  He saw the applicant had the victim in a ""bear hug-type hold"" and while holding the victim in this manner leant his body over the external boundary railing.
17The victim's brother rushed towards the applicant, tackling the applicant to the ground and breaking his hold of the victim.  The applicant was then restrained by the victim's brother.  When the applicant was released, he appeared to attempt to walk towards the victim.  The victim's brother told the applicant he was not to approach the victim and the applicant was seen to leave the walkway area. 
18The statement of facts notes that when the applicant returned home after assaulting and detaining the victim, he told his wife:
""I went and said to her stay off my back please and she gave me that attitude and it made me angry.""
19After his arrest on the following day, the applicant engaged in a recorded interview with police during which he admitted confronting the victim regarding what he said were issues of respect.  The applicant agreed that he had approached the victim in an angry state, but denied any intention to physically injure her.
The judge's findings
20The sentencing judge noted that the objective gravity of the offending is reflected by the maximum penalty set by Parliament of 14 years imprisonment.  He observed that the sentences to be imposed must reflect the need for general deterrence and must be sufficient to deter the offender from repeating the offence.
21The judge then identified the recognised relevant factors to the assessment of the seriousness of the offence under s 86 of the Crimes Act.  These included the period, the circumstances of the detention, the extent to which fear or terror may be occasioned in the victim, the person being detained and the purpose of the detention: see R v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183 at [32].  
22The judge found that, objectively, the offence was of ""a most serious kind"".  The applicant intended to place the victim in fear that she was going to be killed, with a view to ensuring that the victim ceased contact with his wife.  The advantage sought by the applicant was a psychological one; namely, to assert his authority over the victim.  The victim believed that she was going to fall to her death and the applicant's threat that he was going to kill her caused the victim extreme terror.
23Although the duration of the detention was not lengthy, the judge found that it was marked by an intense period of aggression.  The judge accepted that there was no planning involved in the offence and the act was impulsive.  Nonetheless, he considered that the conduct needed to be viewed against an earlier threat made by the applicant some two months prior.  
24The judge observed that offences under s 86 are committed in a wide range of circumstances.  He considered the background to the offence, and the relationship between the applicant and the victim and made a finding that:
""The offender sought to exercise violence with the intention of controlling familial relationships.  He sought to do that in a public setting.  The victim was entitled to move about in the community without interference with her liberty.  The offender sought to intimidate the victim and placed her in substantial fear as she went about her life.  The nature of the offending here creates a greater need for specific deterrence and the need for denunciation.""
25The judge found that the victim believed that she was going to fall to her death and that the offender intended to place the victim in that state of mind by placing part of her body, from her mid-chest upwards, over the railing facing a significant drop of some four storeys.
26As to the objective of the detention, the judge found:
""The words used by the offender, that he was going to kill her at this time would have placed the victim in extreme terror.""
27The judge noted that the offence occurred in the presence of the victim's nieces aged 11 years and 9 years, and within view of members of the public at a shopping centre with complete disregard to the impact of such conduct.  
28The judge noted the victim impact statement which described the way in which the applicant's conduct had affected the victim socially, emotionally and mentally.  This included the horror, fear and sadness she experiences when she recalls the assault; losing sleep, waking in the middle of the night, experiencing flashbacks and nightmares, and being fearful and wary when leaving the house.  
Subjective features of the applicant
29Subjective matters taken into account by the sentencing judge included the age of the applicant, 37 years at the time of sentencing; his background, having been born in Morocco and the youngest of six children; his travel to Australia on holiday in 1995 and obtaining a visa; his marriage in 1999; his employment history and the subsequent grant of a disability support pension in 2008 as a result of his anxiety and depression.
30A psychological report from Mr T Smith noted that the applicant suffered a longstanding anxiety condition.  The applicant gave a history that he had developed social phobia and depression approximately 12 years prior to the sentencing date.  There had been no apparent trigger to the onset of these conditions.  The applicant's symptoms had gradually increased to the point where he was unable to be in public places where there were many people, such as shopping centres.  
31The psychologist expressed the opinion that by 2008, the applicant's reported symptoms were severe resulting in the loss of employment, loss of independence and continuing avoidance of crowds.  The psychologist diagnosed the applicant as suffering, at the time of the offending, an anxiety disorder - social phobia with panic attacks and depressive disorder secondary to an anxiety disorder.  
32Importantly however, the psychologist expressed the further opinion that while the applicant's agitation about family relations could have been exacerbated by his anxiety symptoms, his symptoms were not a factor underlying his offending.  The judge found that the applicant was not cognitively impaired at the time of the offence.  
33The applicant did not give evidence.  He told the psychologist that his social phobia would prevent him doing so, but he wanted to convey his remorse.  The judge noted however, that comments made by the applicant recorded in the pre-sentence report and the account given in his recorded interview with the police, indicated that he sought to minimise the gravity of his conduct.  Similarly, the applicant provided a history to the psychologist which suggested that the victim was engaged in significant acts in order to corrupt his wife and cause the breakdown of his relationship with her.
34The judge found that the applicant's attempt to minimise his conduct suggested that he did not appreciate the gravity of his conduct and evidenced that he was lacking in insight as to the impact of his actions upon the victim.
35The judge concluded that little weight could be given to the applicant's expressions of remorse, having regard to the explanation of his conduct provided to the psychologist and the probation officer.  His Honour did take into account the applicant's expressions of remorse to others, as evidenced in the testimonials, in a limited way.
36The judge took into account that the applicant's underlying mental health condition, including his social phobia, was likely to cause hardship in custody.  He took this hardship into account as part of the mix of subjective factors.  He also took into account the delay of about 3 years between the offending and the time of sentence, the 3 days spent in custody at the time of his arrest and his reporting obligations whilst on bail.
37A 10 per cent discount was allowed for the utilitarian value of the plea.  No complaint is made in this regard on appeal. 
38The judge was unable to make a finding as to the prospects of the applicant's rehabilitation.  He considered that continuing treatment would significantly enhance those prospects.  
39The judge found special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, in that the applicant required continuing mental health treatment, including psychological counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy.  He accepted that due to the applicant's underlying mental health condition he was not an appropriate vehicle for the full weight of general deterrence.
Submissions on appeal
40The applicant's written submissions accepted that no error attached to the judge's findings of fact or application of enunciated principle.  
41Nonetheless the applicant contended that in weighing the balance between the objective severity of the offending and the applicant's personal circumstances, the judge erred resulting in a sentence which is manifestly excessive.  This submission relied upon a number of comparator cases as suggesting a manifestly excessive sentence in this case.  
42These cases are considered below.  It should be observed, however, that the applicant's reliance on appeal on comparator cases is inconsistent with the position which was adopted before the sentencing judge.  On that occasion, counsel for the applicant submitted that the circumstances in which the kidnapping-type of offence can be committed are so divergent as to make statistics and comparable cases of very little assistance (AB 176, Tcpt lines 1-3).
43In oral argument the applicant contended that the sentencing judge was required to express a conclusion as to the ""objective seriousness"" of the offence, that is, where in the objective range the offending fell by reference to the maximum penalty for kidnapping.
44The applicant argued that this requirement was supported by authorities which hold that a bare recitation of the facts constituting the offence and a reference to the objective features of the offence does not satisfy the requirements of sentencing: R v Cage [2006] NSWCCA 304 at [15]-[19] per Latham J (Hunt AJA and Johnson J agreeing).  The applicant also referred to authorities emphasising that some assessment of the objective seriousness of any offending is an element of the sentencing process: Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146 at [49] per Johnson J; R v Gebrail (Unreported, NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, Mahoney JA, 18 November 1994) Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; 163 CLR 447 at 452.
45The applicant complained that the sentencing judge had failed to conduct any assessment of the criminal culpability of the applicant as against the maximum penalty for the kidnapping offence, taking into account the different elements of the offence and the varying degrees of criminality which attached to those elements.  
46The applicant also contended that the objective criminality of the applicant's offending, being that of intimidation, was at the lower end of the spectrum of kidnapping offences.
Manifest excess
47A submission that a sentence is excessive (or inadequate) derives from the last kind of error identified in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505.  As explained in Sheen v R [2011] NSWCCA 259 at [162] per Johnson J (Hall and Price JJ agreeing):
""To establish a ground claiming manifest excess, it is necessary for the Appellant to demonstrate that the sentence under challenge is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [27]. Absent error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing Judge merely because (if it be the case) the Court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing Judge exercised his discretion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672 [15]. Nor is appellate intervention on the ground of manifest excess justified simply because (if it be the case) the result arrived at in the District Court is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases. Intervention is warranted only where error is established in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58].""
48In the present case, the applicant's argument that the sentencing is manifestly excessive may be approached in one of two ways.  The first is that, making due allowance for the seriousness of the kidnapping offence and the personal circumstances of the applicant, including his anxiety condition, the sentence should have been at the lower end of the scale.  The second approach is that the sentence might be regarded as excessive because if his Honour had engaged in the exercise of more precisely identifying the level of objective seriousness, and properly analysed the relevant facts in the way the applicant contends he should have, the result would have been that he would have found the objective seriousness of the offending at the low level.  
49The problem with the first approach, in my view, is that it does not give sufficient weight to the regard the sentencing judge was entitled to, and did take to the facts as found by him, as to which no complaint is made.  
50Those findings included that the detention was marked by an intense period of aggression upon the victim; the applicant intended to place the victim in fear that she was going to be killed; the applicant sought to exercise violence with the intention of controlling familial relationships; the objective of the detention would have placed the victim in extreme terror; and that the victim believed that she was going to fall to her death.  
51The applicant's complaint that the judge should have given more weight to the applicant's personal circumstances does not establish error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, let alone that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust.
52The problem with the second approach, in my view, is that contrary to the applicant's contention, the sentencing judge did assess the objective seriousness of the offending.  The judge found that the offending was of ""a most serious kind"".  The applicant did not dispute this finding.  Indeed during the course of oral argument, counsel for the applicant acknowledged that the offence was clearly very serious: (AT 5.50).
53The judge's assessment of the gravity of the offending was undoubtedly open to him on the facts as found.  His Honour after clearly identifying the salient features of the offence, gave careful and thorough reasons for this finding.  These are referred to in summary terms at [20]-[26] above.
54Contrary to the applicant's submissions, the judge had regard to the separate elements of the kidnapping offence under s 86(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.  No complaint is made by the applicant with his Honour's identification of the gravamen of the offence for the purpose of sentencing, being the unlawful detaining of a person.  Nor is there any complaint made with his Honour's observation that the nature of the advantage that the offender sought to obtain is not the determinative factor, or considered to be conclusive, as to the seriousness of the offence.
55The applicant's contention that the nature of the intimidation in the present case is at the lower end of the criminal spectrum must be rejected.  The nature of the intimidation, as found by the sentencing judge, was extreme.  The victim was put in fear of her life.  She was placed from her mid-chest upwards over the railing facing a drop of some four storeys; she thought she was going to fall to her death.  The applicant's characterisation of the nature of the intimidation is contrary to the sentencing judge's findings, which are not challenged.  This is fatal to the applicant's submissions.
56More generally it may be accepted that an assessment of the objective gravity of any offence has traditionally been an essential element of the sentencing process: R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349.
57However, the applicant's submission that the sentencing judge failed to state precisely where in the range of ""objective seriousness"" the offending fell, paid no attention to the fact that the s 86 offence did not carry a standard non-parole period.  Nor did the applicant address the authorities in this Court, both pre and post Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, which have considered the question of the extent to which the sentencing judge need make a detailed finding as to where the offending fell in relation to the range of objective seriousness, for offences which do not carry a standard non-parole period.
58In this regard, there are a number of statements in this Court pre Muldrock, that in the case of an offence which does not carry a standard non-parole period, it is unnecessary for the sentencing judge to embark upon a detailed finding as to where the offence lay in relation to the range of objective seriousness for such an offence: Sivell v R [2009] NSWCCA 286 at [2]-[5] per McClellan CJ at CL; Georgopolous v R [2010] NSWCCA 246 at [3] per Allsop P, at [30] per Howie AJ; Nguyen v R [2011] NSWCCA 127 per Hoeben J at [38]-41] (McClellan CJ at CL and Grove AJ agreeing); Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118; 209 A Crim R 509 at [71]-[77] per Simpson J (Davies J and Grove AJ agreeing); Turner v R [2011] NSWCCA 189 at [53] per Simpson J (Basten JA and Garling J agreeing); Charbaji v R [2011] NSWCA 181 at [15], per Buddin J (Whealy JA and Harrison J agreeing).  
59As explained by McClellan CJ at CL in Sivell v R at [5], a distinction is to be drawn between the two modes of expression whereby a sentencing judge may indicate the seriousness of an offence under consideration:
""The 'objective seriousness' of an offence is a different concept to the 'seriousness of the offence', the latter expression being commonly used when determining the sentence, both total term and non-parole period (if appropriate) for that offence. Where a standard non-parole period is not provided for an offence, the objective seriousness of the offence does not, of itself, direct attention to any particular type of punishment or term of imprisonment which must both be determined after all of the relevant matters, both objective and subjective, which inform the seriousness of the offence have been considered.""
60These authorities should not be taken as doubting that any sentencing decision calls for attention to be paid to the objective gravity of the offending: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357; Khoury v R at [71] per Simpson J.  Rather, where the offence in question does not carry a standard non-parole period, it is not necessary for the sentencing judge to have made a finding as to where precisely it lay in of the spectrum of offending: Charbaji v R at [15] citing Simpson J in Khoury v R at [74].
61It has been observed in this Court post Muldrock, that the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock has left somewhat opaque the meaning of the term ""objective seriousness"": R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCAA 288 at [19]-[21].  Nevertheless, as subsequent decisions of this Court have stated, it remains part of a sentencing judge's function to consider the objective gravity of the subject crime and the moral culpability of the offender: Ayshow v R [2011] NSWCCA 240 at [39]; Sheen v R at [169]; Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [47].
62In the present case, his Honour's remarks on sentence perform this function.
63Taking into account the wide range of circumstances that offences under s 86 are committed, in my view, it was unnecessary for his Honour to express a more detailed view as to where the offending fell within the range of objective seriousness.
Relevance of comparator cases?
64The applicant relies upon six cases as suggesting a manifestly excessive sentence in this case.  However, this submission wrongly assumes that the wide variety of circumstances in which the offending can occur readily yields a range.
65An examination of the facts in each case relied upon by the applicant confirms the limited utility of comparing outcomes of the exercise of the sentencing discretion, especially as between cases which involve very different circumstances of detention, and the extent to which the offender's mental state at the time of the offending was significant in some of those cases, and those in which it was not.
66In Williams v R; Saunders v R [2006] NSWCCA 33, the appeal was allowed for Williams on the basis of parity in respect of a sentence of 4 years imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years for an offence contrary to s 86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years.  Williams was resentenced to 2 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months.  
67There were a number of distinguishing features in relation to Williams compared to his co-offender, Saunders, who was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years.  These included that a discount of 10 per cent ought to have been allowed in respect of Williams' offer to enter a plea; there were significant differences between both the objective and subjective factors concerning Williams' offending in contrast to his co-offender Saunders, in particular Williams was not the instigator of the offence and the unlawful detention was already on foot at the time he was contacted by his co-offender; Williams' involvement in the detention was only for a period of two hours compared to six hours in respect of Saunders; the purpose of the detention was to find out who were the victim's accomplices in a break-in at Saunders' premises when a motorcycle had been stolen; the nature of the detention involved driving the victim to a picnic area in a State Forest and forcing him to dig a hole and Saunders had said to the victim during the incident that it would be his ""bed for the night"".  Significantly, at [45], Hall J (with whom Basten JA and Howie J agreed), accepted the sentencing judge's finding that personal deterrence was not as important as it may be in other cases.
68Next, the applicant referred to Heine v R [2008] NSWCCA 61 and the cases referred to therein.  The Crown correctly pointed out that Heine was specifically referred to in the Crown's written submissions below.  
69In Heine, after a 15 per cent discount for a guilty plea, the offender was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with 2 years non-parole for the offence of detain for advantage contrary to s 86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act.  The victim was Heine's wife.  He had tied her hands together and her legs together whilst she was sleeping, produced two large kitchen knives, saying that one was for her and the other was for him, that he would kill her first and then kill himself.  The purpose of the detention was to interrogate his wife to identify the man with whom Heine believed she was having an affair.  Heine videotaped his interrogation.  His wife believed that she was going to die.  The detention lasted for several hours before Heine telephoned his brother and reported what he had done.  His brother told him to free his wife, which he did.  
70The sentencing judge took into account a number of subjective features including that Heine suffered from a depressive illness, was psychotic and had an alcohol dependence. 
71In R v DRR [2004] NSWCCA 126, this Court dismissed an appeal against a sentence of 4 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months imposed for an offence contrary to s 86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act.  This sentence was imposed on an offender who was suffering from a drug-induced psychosis at the time of the offence.  The offender persuaded his victim to give him a lift in her car.  His behaviour became increasingly bizarre during the course of the drive.  He threatened to rape and kill her.  The detention was for about four hours.  The offender had previous convictions for dishonesty, drug and driving offences and one conviction for assault.  
72The sentencing judge took into account a number of subjective features including that the offender had a background of considerable hardship; he expressed remorse; he felt devastated for the victim and recognised the seriousness of the offence; there was moderation of both general and specific deterrence; he was being held in protective custody; and the discount for his guilty plea was 20 per cent.
73In R v Lee [2003] NSWCCA 391, the offender was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months for the offence contrary to s 86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act.  The offender had entered a school to steal money from a classroom but was disrupted by students and teachers.  He locked a teacher and a group of students in a storeroom and said that he had a bomb.  He was armed with a knife and had threatened children.  The detention lasted for 20 minutes before police arrived.  
74The sentencing judge took into account the offender's subjective features which included that he had been consistently seeking treatment for his mental illness and was discharged from a number of facilities in the weeks prior to the offence.  His conduct in committing the offence was characterised as ""bizarre"" and his mental condition impacted his capacity to make rational judgments.  Furthermore, the offender was remorseful and his sentence was to be served on protection.  The discount for the guilty plea was 25 per cent.
75In R v Pearson [2004] NSWCCA 129, this Court imposed a sentence following appeal of 5 years imprisonment with 3 years non-parole for three offences contrary to s 85A(1) (as s 86(1) of the Crimes Act was originally numbered).  The offender entered the classroom of a school demanding to see his daughter, to whom he had been denied access over the Christmas period.  He placed a can of petrol on the floor of the classroom and detained a group of school children and their teacher in an attempt to force the authority to produce his daughter.  He had one prior conviction for assault.  He was suffering from a major depressive illness.  Fresh evidence was led on appeal to show that he had been advised to cease his medication six weeks prior to the incident.  His sentence was discounted by 22.5 per cent to reflect the value of his plea of guilty.  
76The significant subjective features of the offender's conduct included that he had ceased taking his medication on medical advice; and the impact of the mental illness was significant in moderating of general deterrence, denunciation and punishment.
77In Ha v R [2010] NSWCCA 83, the offender was sentenced to 3 years and 4 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months for an offence contrary to s 86(2) of the Crimes Act.  He had been convicted after a trial.  His appeal against sentence was dismissed.  The victim was known to the co-offender.  The offenders had coordinated the luring of the victim to the offender's apartment at a time when both the offenders and another ""large"" person would be present, so as to intimidate the victim into providing the sum of $50,000.  The sentencing judge regarded the physical assault on the victim by the co-offender as being relatively minor, but of sufficient severity to cause the victim to capitulate and thus render further violence unnecessary. The detention was for a relatively short period.  
78The sentencing judge agreed with the offender's submission that the objective seriousness of the offence was not at mid-range, however he considered the sentence imposed was appropriate having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the offender.
79As already noted at [66] above, the comparator cases are of limited utility.  Furthermore, it may be observed that there are significant distinguishing features between the comparator cases and the present case.  
80First, there are differences between the discount for the plea of guilty allowed in some of the comparator cases and the discount allowed in the present.  This affects the notional head sentence in those cases, and the present case.
81Secondly, in each of Heine, DRR, Lee and Pearson, the sentencing decision reflected the weight given by the sentencing judge to the mental health condition of the offender at the time of the offence.  By contrast, in the present case, the sentencing judge was satisfied that the applicant was not cognitively impaired at the time of the offence, although he did take into account his social phobia and anxiety condition as a relevant subjective feature.  
82Thirdly, in Williams v R, the case most strongly relied upon by the applicant, the lesser sentence imposed on Williams on appeal was on the basis of parity, and reflected his lesser role as co-offender and, the sentencing judge's finding that personal deterrence was not as important (in that case) as it may be in other cases.
83In my view, these cases do not assist the applicant.  The sentence imposed by his Honour lay within the range of proper exercise of sentencing discretion in the circumstances of this case.

2420645,Azzi v R [2013] NSWCCA 249,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2HIDDEN J:  I agree with Fullerton J.
3FULLERTON J:  John Azzi appeals his conviction for supply of a prohibited drug, namely 16.4 grams of heroin, following a jury trial in the District Court.  The Crown relied upon the deeming provisions in s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 to make out the supply charge laid contrary to s 25(1) of the Act.  
4The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years and 6 months to commence on 18 February 2012 with a non-parole period of 3 years.  There is no appeal against sentence. 
5The appellant relies upon two grounds of appeal, each of which concerns a conversation he had with police during the execution of a search warrant at his home in the course of which the heroin was located in a wardrobe in his bedroom.  The conversation under challenge related to 0.38 grams of methylamphetamine which was also found by police in the wardrobe.  As to that drug, the appellant did not deny knowing the powder was where the police found it, but said that he did not know what it was and that he thought it was ""sugar or probably sugar"".  The appellant later pleaded guilty in the Local Court to being in possession of the methylamphetamine.  The earlier claim that he believed the powder was sugar or probably sugar was referred to on the appeal as ""the sugar lie"".
6The first ground of appeal (the only ground the subject of the filed notice of appeal) alleges error in the trial judge permitting the jury to use ""the sugar lie"" as credibility evidence contrary to s 108 of the Evidence Act 1995.  In written submissions the Crown emphasised that credibility evidence is defined in s 101A of the Evidence Act as evidence relevant to the credibility of a witness or other person only because it affects the assessment of that person's credibility.  In the Crown's submission, because the sugar lie was admitted in the trial as coincidence evidence under s 98 of the Evidence Act it was not admitted only as credibility evidence and, for that reason, the appellant's reliance on the operation of s 108A and s 108B in support of the error contended for in the first ground of appeal had no application.  The Crown also submitted that the prosecutor's duty of fairness required the sugar lie to be led and this also displaced the operation of s 108A and s 108B of the Evidence Act.
7Following receipt of the Crown submissions, the appellant filed an amended notice of appeal alleging error in the admission of the sugar lie as coincidence evidence.  Counsel for the appellant acknowledged that the second ground of appeal was drawn to meet the Crown's filed submissions addressing the first and (at that time) only ground of appeal.  The appellant also conceded that Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applied to the proposed second ground of appeal.  
8The Court heard argument directed to the second ground of appeal reserving the question whether to grant leave to file the additional ground of appeal until determination of the appeal.  For the reasons that follow, I propose that leave be granted to allow consideration of the second ground of appeal.   
The Crown case at trial 
9On 12 August 2010 police executed a search warrant at the appellant's family home where he resided with his parents and two younger brothers.  
10In the wardrobe in the appellant's bedroom police located 16.4 grams of heroin within a knotted freezer bag on a narrow shelf above the sliding door track to the wardrobe.  A mixed DNA profile was identified on the freezer bag, the major component of which was a match with the DNA profile of the appellant which was expected to occur in approximately one in six million in the general population. 
11Police also located in the wardrobe five blue heart-shaped tablets inside a sunglasses case which was later analysed to contain 10mg of the steroid methandienone; three white tablets of the prescription drug Xanax which contained 2mg of alprazolam under some clothing; a glass vial of testosterone amongst some paperwork; and a white crystalline substance, later analysed to contain 0.38 grams of methylamphetamine, in a plastic bag inside a locked safe on a shelf in the wardrobe.  The safe was opened with a key in the appellant's possession.  Police also located a set of digital scales capable of weighing a maximum of 50 grams in a drawer in the wardrobe; a roll of aluminium foil; and $1,030 in cash inside a jacket hanging in the wardrobe.  A certificate was tendered at trial (without objection) which identified heroin and cocaine on a swab that was applied to the scales.
12In the course of a conversation recorded by police during the search the appellant said the white tablets (the Xanax tablets) were sleeping tablets he had been given by a friend and the five heart-shaped tablets were steroids he had also received from a friend.  He said he believed the glass vial of clear liquid to be steroids, but could not say whether it was in fact a steroid.  He said he needed the scales because he had used drugs and he wanted to be sure that ""nobody ripped him off"".  He said that the money was his savings earned while working.  He denied any knowledge of the heroin.  
13When asked about the white crystal substance (the methylamphetamine) the appellant said:Q. And also we found inside your safe, we opened it with your keys, we found this resealable plastic bag with white powder in it, what can you tell us about that? A. I don't know, probably sugar.
Q. Sugar?A. Probably yeah. 
Q. Do you know where it was?A. No, I wouldn't have a clue.
Q. So who would have put it in there if it wasn't you?A. I didn't say I didn't put it in there.  I said I don't know what it is. 
14On 5 December 2011 the appellant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to possessing the methylamphetamine and the other restricted substances.  Fines were imposed.
15In advance of trial the Crown served a notice under s 98 of the Evidence Act of its intention to adduce coincidence evidence.  
16The notice served by the Crown specified the appellant's possession of the methylamphetamine, the other restricted substances and the scales that contained traces of heroin and cocaine as the events relied upon by the Crown to prove the improbability that the appellant was not also in possession of the heroin.  The notice did not specify that the Crown also relied upon what the appellant said to police in the course of the search as part of the events or occurrences relied upon as coincidence evidence.  The material identified in the notice as the source of the coincidence evidence did however nominate a paragraph of the statement of a police officer where the sugar lie was set out, together with the appellant's admission that he was in possession of the other items.  The notice also identified the video recording of the search when those conversations were recorded.  The statements and a transcript of the conversations recorded on the video were tendered in support of the Crown's application for the admission of the coincidence evidence.  
17Section 98 provides as follows: (1)  Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless: (a)  the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and
(b)  the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.
(2)  ...
18Defence counsel objected to the admission of the coincidence evidence because it failed to meet the test for admissibility in s 98(1)(b) and s 101 of the Evidence Act.  No separate objection was taken to the sugar lie being admitted as coincidence evidence.  In particular, no submission was advanced that the sugar lie was not an ""event"" or ""occurrence"" capable of meeting the test for admission as coincidence evidence in the circumstances of the trial.  This was the submission advanced by counsel under the proposed second ground of appeal.  Although this evidence was objected to, no submission was directed to whether the admission of the sugar lie would be in breach of s 108 of the Evidence Act, the error contended for in the first ground of appeal.
19The Crown submitted that the appellant should be refused leave under Rule 4 to argue the proposed second ground of appeal in circumstances where defence counsel could have been under no misapprehension that the coincidence evidence, the subject of the notice, was not limited to the bare fact that other prohibited items were found in the accused's wardrobe, but that it also included the accused's admissions that he was in possession of some of those items and his effective denial that he was in possession of the methylamphetamine.
20The trial judge did not refer to the conversations the accused had with police at the time the scales and the other restricted substances were found in his reasons for admitting the coincidence evidence, as to which his Honour said:  In respect of the methamphetamine and the restricted substances the accused has already entered pleas of guilty and been sentenced in the local court, hence acknowledging his possession, without authority, of those items.
21In his reasons for admitting the evidence, his Honour said:The question for the Court is whether the Court thinks the evidence intended to be adduced by the Crown as to the substances other than the heroin, will either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the Crown, have significant probative value.
Considering the location of all the items, to a greater or lesser degree secreted within the wardrobe, it is the view of the Court that there is indeed significant probative value justifying the admission of the evidence as being relevant to the question or fact in issue, that is did Mr Azzi also possess the 16.4 grams of heroin.  Indeed, in the Court's view the evidence has not merely significant probative value but is highly probative of the fact in issue, although that is a matter for the ultimate determination of a jury.
The connection between the scales, acknowledged at the time of their location as being the accused's scales, having on them heroin traces, provides an inferential link to the 16.4 grams of heroin located also in the wardrobe, that is, in close proximity.
Section 101(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 provides coincidence evidence about an accused that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the accused unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused.
In the Court's view the probative value of the evidence is very high and does substantially outweigh any possible prejudicial effect that it may have on the accused.  It is particularly relevant in the circumstances where the defence is an assertion that the accused was not in possession of the 16.4 grams of heroin.  The revelation to the jury that the accused also possessed small quantities of methylamphetamine, Danabol, Xanax and Testosterone is certainly capable of having some prejudicial effect in the sense that it discloses him to be a person possessed of one other prohibited drug and a number of restricted drugs that he was not authorised to possess.
However, in the Court's view it is not unfair to the accused to admit the evidence.  To the extent that a jury might inappropriately reason from his possession of those items the Court is confident that appropriate directions as to the use to be made of the evidence will protect the accused's interest.
22Immediately following the ruling on the admission of the coincidence evidence, the Crown opened to the jury on the basis that he did not expect there would be any dispute that the methylamphetamine and other restricted substances were found by police at the time the heroin was found, or that these items were in the accused's possession.  The Crown also alerted the jury to the fact that the accused was asked questions by police about the things that were found in his wardrobe at the time of the search and that a video recording of the search would be tendered in evidence. 
23When defence counsel opened the accused's case he confirmed that the accused's possession of the methylamphetamine and the restricted substances would not be in issue.  He submitted that this was in contrast to his client's repeated and sustained denials in respect of the heroin.  
24The Crown called Senior Constable Sarosi as the first witness.  The video recording of the search was tendered through him without objection, including, so far as is relevant to the appeal, the sugar lie set out in [13] above.  Cross-examination of the officer commenced but did not conclude that day. 
25In the absence of the jury, on the next hearing day, there was discussion as to how the jury were to be informed that the accused had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to possession of the methylamphetamine and the other restricted substances.  The Crown informed his Honour that he was content to rely upon the accused's admissions to police during the search that he was in possession of the restricted substances already in evidence but there was an issue as to what the Crown would be permitted to lead to prove his possession of the methylamphetamine.  
26Defence counsel accepted that the plea of guilty constituted an admission that the drug was knowingly in the accused's custody and control at the time of the search (being the essential elements of a charge of possession) and that it was admissible on that basis, but objected to the Crown's reliance on the sugar lie to attack the accused's credit because it lacked sufficient probative value to justify its admission.  Neither counsel referred his Honour to Part 3.7 of the Evidence Act or to the operation of ss 101A or 108A or 108B.  
27In the course of ruling that the Crown could use the sugar lie for credit purposes, his Honour also expressly extended his ruling on the coincidence evidence the previous day to include both the sugar lie and the accused's plea of guilty as an admission that he knew the powder was methylamphetamine and not sugar when he spoke to police.  His Honour did so, however, without addressing the question whether the sugar lie and the plea of guilty were ""events"" or ""circumstances"" of a kind with which s 98 of the Evidence Act is concerned.  There were no submissions directed to that question by either trial counsel.  His Honour ruled as follows:The purpose of the coincidence evidence was not simply to show the context within which the heroin was found, ie a wardrobe in which other restricted or prohibited substances were found, but that the accused was in fact aware of the identity of the restricted substances and particularly, the methylamphetamine.  The pleas of guilty to the two charges in the Local Court constitute admissions as to the elements of those two offences, in particular, as to him being not only in possession of them, but knowing their identity.
The Crown seeks to draw, as coincidence evidence, on the fact that the accused has pleaded guilty to knowing the identity of the prohibited substance methylamphetamine and the restricted substances for the purpose of arguing that there is an improbability of coincidence that he was not also the person who had secreted the heroin in his wardrobe, and that he, in the circumstances, must have been aware of its nature.
Evidence of the accused's possession and knowledge of those substances may well have been capable of being dealt with by appropriate admissions.  As it stands at the moment, the other substances to some extent being covered by admissions in the course of the conversation with police officers, with respect to the methylamphetamine, the position is that the conversation indicates that although the accused admitted to putting the bag of white crystalline substance in his safe, that he thought that it might be sugar.  I should say, his actual words were, ""I don't know, probably sugar"".  
That conversation is now before the jury without objection.  The Crown is entitled to lead evidence of the plea of guilty, particularly in respect of the methylamphetamine, on the basis that [it] is an admission that at the time of the location of the substances, the accused not only knew he possessed it, but that he also knew that it was methylamphetamine.  Relevant to that is, of course, the conversation in which he said it was probably sugar.  The Crown seeks to use, in the absence of any admission otherwise, the plea as demonstrating that the answer ""probably sugar"" was for the purpose of allowing the jury to assess his credibility in relation to the answers that he gave during the course of the conversation already before the jury.
28In his closing address the Crown invited the jury to use the sugar lie to assess the truthfulness of the accused's claim that he did not know the heroin was hidden in his wardrobe.  He said: ... You've heard, members of the jury, that [the appellant] has pleaded guilty to the fact that on that day he was in possession of a drug. His Honour I expect will explain to you the legal definition of possession, but he must have known at that time as he said from his mouth, ""I don't know what it is,"" that it was a drug.
So he told the police, ""Don't know what it is""; he later stands up and pleads guilty, accepting he knew it was a drug. Members of the jury, he lied to the police about that, and I submit to you that you can and you should consider that carefully when you consider whether you should believe him when he said to the police that he knew nothing about the heroin.
29In his summing up the trial judge said: The Crown suggested to you in the course of the submissions that Mr. Azzi, when he said that he did not know what it was, that is, the white substance in the bag in the safe in the Tag Heuer instruction booklet, that it was a lie that the Crown asked you to use as a matter of credibility in assessing what he said in relation to the heroin when he denied knowing anything about it.
30He then continued:On the basis of that, you know that he entered a plea of guilty to the possession of methylamphetamine charge in the Local Court. That plea in itself was an acknowledgement as to knowing or to actually knowing or believing that what he had custody or control of was a prohibited drug, or being aware that there was a significant or real chance that it was. That is, that he was being less than frank when he suggested that it was probably or possibly sugar, because he in fact knew that it was either methylamphetamine or at least there was a significant or real chance that it was in fact a prohibited drug.
31His Honour had earlier given the jury directions about the co-incidence evidence, during which he did not refer to the sugar lie.
Was the sugar lie credibility evidence as defined in s 101A of the Evidence Act?
32In order to consider the challenge to the use of the sugar lie as credibility evidence under the first ground of appeal, it is necessary to consider Part 3.7 of the Evidence Act which operates to limit the manner in which evidence relevant to the credibility of a witness or person may be admitted.
33Section 101A (within Division 1 of Part 3.7) defines credibility evidence as follows:
Credibility evidence, in relation to a witness or other person, is evidence relevant to the credibility of the witness or person that:
(a) is relevant only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, or
(b) is relevant:(i) because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, and
(ii) for some other purpose for which it is not admissible, or cannot be used, because of a provision of Parts 3.2 to 3.6.
34It was the Crown's primary submission that because the sugar lie was properly admitted as part of the coincidence evidence, it was not credibility evidence as defined in s 101A, and the limits on the admissibility of such evidence in s 108A and s 108B in Division 3 of Part 3.7 had no application.  
35Before considering that submission, it is necessary to address what the Crown relied upon as an additional basis for eschewing the operation of s 108A and s 108B in this case, namely that the Crown was obliged to lead evidence of all that the accused said to police during the search in discharge of its duty of fairness, and that leading evidence of the sugar lie was justified for that reason.
36Reliance was placed upon R v Soma [2003] HCA 13; 212 CLR 299; 140 A Crim R 152 where the majority (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) noted at [31] that to put the prosecution case fully and fairly, the Crown must adduce any admissible evidence of what an accused person tells police when interviewed, requiring the Crown to take ""the good with the bad and put it all before the jury"".  The question that survives that unassailable statement of principle is whether, on the appeal, it is open to the Crown to invoke the principle to avoid the limitations on admissibility that would otherwise apply on the admission of credibility evidence, assuming that s 108A and s 108B are called into operation, when the purpose in leading that evidence at trial, and its ultimate use in submissions to the jury, was to attack the appellant's credit.  For my part, I do not see that the obligation on the Crown to present its case fully and fairly extends that distance.  Indeed, on one view, it is in conflict with it.   
37Reliance was also placed upon the judgment of this court in R v Chen [2002] NSWCCA 174; 130 A Crim R 300 at [28] (and its citation with approval by Simpson J in Peacock v R [2008] NSWCCA 264; 190 A Crim R 454 at [43]) and R v Rymer [2005] NSWCCA 310; 156 A Crim R 84 as authority for the same proposition.  (I note that although the current formulation of credibility evidence in s 101A was inserted by an amending Act that was operational as at 1 January 2009, it is analogous to s 102, the section with which the Court in Chen was concerned, despite the fact that s 102 was confined to the evidence concerning the credibility of a witness whereas s 101A was extended to include the credibility of a person not called as a witness.) 
38The consideration given to the operation of s 102 of the Evidence Act in Chen arose in circumstances where it was argued that in leading evidence that the principal Crown witness (a conspirator in a commercial drug importation) had provided a written undertaking to cooperate with law enforcement authorities, and that an undertaking to that effect was tendered, s 102 of the Evidence Act was breached because that evidence could only have been relevant to bolster the witness' credit.  The Court rejected that submission.  The Crown in the present appeal relies upon the following passage as obliging the Crown at trial to have led evidence of the sugar lie: [28] Section 102 of the Evidence Act provides simply that ""[e]vidence that is relevant only to a witness's credibility is not admissible"". The first question now to be decided is, therefore, whether the evidence led by the Crown of the witness Chan's having undertaken in writing to cooperate with law enforcement authorities breached the rule established by section 102. In that connection we observe:
[1] The appellant's present contention that there was such breach, seems to us to be weakened by the concession, which we understand to be carried by the written submissions previously quoted, that it did not breach the section 102 rule to lead in chief from Chan the fact that he was himself complicit in the relevant importation; and that he had pleaded guilty to the offence constituted by his complicity, receiving in that behalf a sentence discounted in consideration of his agreeing to give evidence at the trial of, relevantly, the present appellant and his co-appellants. If it does not breach the section 102 rule to disclose at least so much of the true status of such a witness as Chan, then we do not see the logic in holding that the frank and truthful disclosure of the additional circumstance that he, Chan, was prepared to protect his own interests as he saw them by giving a written undertaking, should constitute such a breach of section 102.
[2] There is authority of long standing in this Court for the proposition that the true status of such a witness as the witness Chan in the present case is relevant in a sense that extends beyond credibility alone: Reg v Booth (1982) 8 A Crim R 81; followed in Reg v Gonzalez-Betes [2001] NSWCCA 226. 
[3] In Booth each member of the Court, (Street CJ, O'Brien CJ of Cr D and Lee J) gave concurring but separate judgments. It will suffice for present purposes to quote the following passages from the judgment of Lee J:""The direction which practice requires a judge to give when an accomplice gives evidence for the Crown is intended to achieve a particular purpose: namely to bring to the attention of the jury that the evidence of such a witness may be in a different position from the point of view of reliability from that of other witnesses. The trial judge is expected to bring home to the jury that it is dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of such a witness; and this direction has the consequence that the witness is, in a real sense, held up as a witness whose testimony is suspect. It is left to the jury to appraise the evidence of the witness in the light of the warning given. In my opinion the requirement that the judge give the direction and that the jury then assesses the witness' evidence in the light of that warning provides the justification for the admissibility into evidence of evidence showing the position of the accomplice vis-à-vis the Crown which is the party calling him. In order for the jury to assess the degree of danger involved in evaluating his uncorroborated testimony, it is necessary for the Crown to disclose whether the witness has for instance been offered or granted a pardon, or whether it is not intended to proceed against him, or whether in fact he has been charged with an offence arising out of or related to the matter with which the accused is charged. Such evidence, in my opinion, goes to the witness' status as an accomplice, and that is a relevant matter for the jury to consider. It is particularly relevant in regard to the extent to which the evidence of that accomplice can be called upon to found a conviction of the accused."" [8 A Crim R, 86,87]
[4] We agree, with respect, with that analysis of Lee J. We are not persuaded that those responsible for the drafting of section 102 of the Evidence Act intended simply to abrogate the principles thus explained. The evidence is not tendered as evidence relevant only to a witness's credibility because it is tendered pursuant to the Crown's duty of fairness to the accused to lay out before the jury the status of the witness without that status being dragged out in cross-examination in a manner which might not be favourable to the interests of the accused. Section 9(1) provides that the Act does not affect the operation of a principle or rule of common law in relation to evidence except in so far as the Act provides otherwise expressly or by necessary implication. Section 102 does not provide otherwise. There are other forms of evidence in chief which might, on one approach, be said to relate to credibility, while not being excluded by s 102. It is customary to obtain the address and occupation of witnesses at the start of the examination in chief. Strictly speaking the address and occupation of a particular witness at the time of the trial is irrelevant to any issue, though either an address or an occupation at the time of the events in issue can be. The evidence is received simply in order to locate the witness in society. Similarly, the qualifications of an expert do not go to an issue, and, if there is no objection to the witness's expertise, can only be relevant to the reliability of the opinions or other evidence to which the witness testifies. Yet s 102 cannot be construed to render that kind of evidence inadmissible when for centuries it has been admissible. We reject, therefore, the proposition basal to paragraph (a), as did this Court in R v Gonzales-Betes [2001] NSWCCA 226. 
...
39I am not persuaded that the decision in Chen is authority for the approach to the construction of s 101A in the way contended for by the Crown on the appeal, or that the Crown was obliged to lead evidence of the sugar lie in discharge of any duty of fairness over the objection of defence counsel.  
Was the sugar lie properly admitted as part of the coincidence evidence led by the Crown?  
40Counsel for the appellant conceded that there was no error in the admission of the appellant's possession of the various restricted substances, the methylamphetamine and the scales with traces of heroin and cocaine, as coincidence evidence.  He accepted that those separate acts of possession were properly considered by the trial judge to be a series of related events under s 98(1) and that the tests for admissibility in s 98(1)(b) and s 101 were satisfied for the reasons set out in [21] above.  He also conceded that there was no error in the appellant's plea of guilty in the Local Court being admitted to prove that he was in knowing possession of the methylamphetamine at that time, contrary to the appellant's assertion to police at the time of the search that he believed the powder was ""probably sugar"".  Counsel's challenge in the proposed second ground of appeal was limited to the sugar lie being relied upon by the Crown on the appeal as part of the coincidence evidence admitted at trial in order to meet the error contended for in the first ground of appeal.  
41I do not understand it to be submitted that a statement or verbal utterance cannot, in appropriate circumstances, be an ""event"" or ""occurrence"" for the purposes of the application of s 98 of the Evidence Act.  Rather, it was submitted that the telling of the sugar lie in this case was not an event the occurrence of which was relevant to whether the appellant was in possession of the heroin (the purpose for which his possession of the other items was admitted as coincidence evidence) because, what he said about the methylamphetamine (that it was sugar or probably sugar) was not relevantly similar to what he said about the other items in his possession (in fact it was markedly dissimilar from those statements since they constituted admissions that he was in possession of those items) and, for that reason, the sugar lie could not bear upon the probability that he was in possession of the heroin and, for that reason, should not have been admitted as coincidence evidence under s 98.
42Even if that were not the precise analysis of the operation of s 98 contended for by the appellant's counsel as it applied to the sugar lie, in my view it is the correct analysis and in admitting the sugar lie as part of the coincidence evidence his Honour was in error.  That being the case, the Crown submission that s 108A and s 108B have no operation because the sugar lie was part of the coincidence evidence and not relevant only to the appellant's credibility is rejected.  That said, it appears from the Crown's closing submissions, and his Honour's summing up, that the evidence was treated as going only to the accused's credit in any event although, as I have noted, no consideration was given to s 101A of the Evidence Act in that connection.  
43In the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, I would grant leave to the appellant to file the additional ground of appeal.  I would also grant leave under Rule 4.  Although I am persuaded that the error contended for in the second ground of appeal is made out, for the reasons which follow, because the evidence was properly treated (or admitted) as credibility evidence, no miscarriage of justice has resulted and the appeal should be dismissed. 
Was the evidence properly admitted in compliance with s 108 of the Evidence Act?
44Division 2 of Part 3.7 concerns credibility evidence adduced in relation to witnesses in the proceedings.  As the appellant did not give evidence, Division 2 has no application to the appeal.
45Division 3 of Part 3.7 concerns credibility evidence of persons who are not witnesses but who have made out of court representations that have been admitted into evidence. 
46Section 108A provides that ""credibility evidence"" about such persons is not admissible unless the evidence could ""substantially affect the assessment of the person's credibility"".  Section 108B imposes further restrictions where person who made the representation is the accused. 
108A   Admissibility of evidence of credibility of person who has made a previous representation
(1)  If: 
(a)  evidence of a previous representation has been admitted in a proceeding, and
(b)  the person who made the representation has not been called, and will not be called, to give evidence in the proceeding,
credibility evidence about the person who made the representation is not admissible unless the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the person's credibility.
(2)  Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purposes of subsection (1), it is to have regard to: 
(a)  whether the evidence tends to prove that the person who made the representation knowingly or recklessly made a false representation when the person was under an obligation to tell the truth, and
(b)  the period that elapsed between the doing of the acts or the occurrence of the events to which the representation related and the making of the representation.
108B   Further protections: previous representations of an accused who is not a witness
(1)  This section applies only in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to section 108A.
(2)  If the person referred to in that section is a defendant, the credibility evidence is not admissible unless the court gives leave.
(3)  Despite subsection (2), leave is not required if the evidence is about whether the defendant: (a)  is biased or has a motive to be untruthful, or
(b)  is, or was, unable to be aware of or recall matters to which his or her previous representation relates, or
(c)  has made a prior inconsistent statement.
(4)  The prosecution must not be given leave under subsection (2) unless evidence adduced by the defendant has been admitted that: (a)  tends to prove that a witness called by the prosecution has a tendency to be untruthful, and
(b)  is relevant solely or mainly to the witness's credibility.(5)  A reference in subsection (4) to evidence does not include a reference to evidence of conduct in relation to: 
(a)  the events in relation to which the defendant is being prosecuted, or
(b)  the investigation of the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted.
(6)  Another defendant must not be given leave under subsection (2) unless the previous representation of the defendant that has been admitted includes evidence adverse to the defendant seeking leave.
47The appellant's counsel analysed the operation of s 108A as it concerns the sugar lie in the following way.  He submitted that the previous representation with which the operation of the section is concerned in this case, is the appellant's denial that he was in possession of the heroin, led through the police officer.  Counsel submitted that credibility evidence about the appellant was not admissible unless it was capable of substantially effecting the jury's assessment of his credibility.  Although not openly conceding that the sugar lie satisfied that test (but proceeding on the assumption that the Court would take the view that it was), counsel submitted that it did not satisfy the further exclusionary provision in s 108B and, for that reason, the Crown should not have been permitted to use the evidence to attack the accused's credit.  For my part, I am satisfied the sugar lie was capable of substantially affecting the jury's assessment of the appellant's credibility generally and, in particular, the weight which might be given to his denial that he was in possession of the heroin.  
48Counsel then submitted that none of the exceptions in s 108B(3) applied and, accordingly, it was necessary for the Crown to be granted leave to adduce the credibility evidence.  He further submitted that since leave was not sought (and if sought would not have been granted under s 108B(4)) the evidence should not have been admitted.  He submitted that the accused's lie about the methylamphetamine being sugar, or probably sugar, is not inconsistent with his denying any knowledge of the heroin and for that reason the exception in s 108B(3)(c) is not engaged.  
49The Crown submitted that it was the sugar lie, proved to be such by the appellant's admission that he was in possession of the methylamphetamine implicit in his plea of guilty in the Local Court, that is the evidence about which the accused made a prior inconsistent statement as provided for in s 108(3)(c), and leave was not required for the admission of the sugar lie for that reason.  
50In my view, the sugar lie is the evidence ""about whether the accused made a prior inconsistent statement"" (namely his denial that he was in possession of the heroin) as provided for in s 108B(3)(c) and for that reason leave was not required for the admission of the evidence.   
51In the result, I am satisfied that the sugar lie was properly admitted as credibility evidence and available to be used by the jury to assess the credibility of the appellant's denials to police that he was in knowing possession of the heroin.  I would reject the first ground of appeal.
52The orders I propose are as follow:1.  Leave be granted to permit the appellant to file an amended notice of appeal.2.  The appeal against conviction is dismissed.

		08 November 2013",2013-11-07 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2420721,R v Shiell [2013] NSWDC 279,"Sentence

1HIS HONOUR: What I am about to describe can accurately be categorised, as the offender Nathan Shiell himself recognises, as a home invasion. He, while drunk, together with another man, forced his way into premises where he knew people, including his young son, were inside and whilst in there assaulted someone, causing actual bodily harm, only desisting when he saw his young son crying.

2The maximum penalty for an offence of this type is 20 years and there is a standard non parole period of five years. Those of course indicate the seriousness with which the legislature believes offences of this type should be treated. I have taken into account both the maximum penalty and the standard non parole period in determining the appropriate sentence in this case. My reasons for not imposing the standard non parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.

3It is Mr Booth's submission that ultimately I should impose upon his client a suspended sentence of imprisonment. The Crown does not speak in opposition to that, but that does not mean that I should accept the joint position of the parties made to me today. This was a serious offence and considerations of general deterrence and punishment need to be given full weight.

4The offender was previously in a relationship with a woman called Lauren Barr. They had a child. The relationship broke down and Ms Barr formed a new relationship with a man by the name of Reece Wilkins. One evening the offender received a photograph on his phone from Ms Barr's mother. It showed his son with some bruising. The offender formed the opinion that that bruising was not accidental. He believed his son to be in danger. 

5He had been drinking and so, with a mate of his who drove him, he went to the premises where Ms Barr, Mr Wilkins and the young boy were living. They first banged on the front door. The offender yelled for the door to be opened but, not surprisingly, those inside refused. The offender then removed the flyscreen from the kitchen window and he and his mate climbed in. 

6An altercation then developed. There was wrestling and punching between Mr Wilkins and the offender, with the offender's mate trying to hit Mr Wilkins with a glass bottle. So violent was the fight that two rear windows of the house were smashed. Eventually Ms Barr managed to get between Mr Wilkins and the offender. Notwithstanding that Ms Barr was holding the offender's son in her arms, the offender did not desist. Instead he continued to try and push past Ms Barr, who I repeat was holding their son, to get to Mr Wilkins. Eventually he stopped and left. He was eventually arrested and declined to answer any questions put to him by police. 

7It is remarkable that the offender, who suggests that his primary purpose in committing this offence was to somehow protect his son, would terrify him in the way he did and would not stop to pause at all to think about the consequences for his son of seeing his father break into a home, assault another person and carry on as he did.

8Mr Shiell is now 23. He was 22 when he committed this offence. His upbringing was not terribly remarkable in context of people who appear before the court. That is not to say that it was ideal. His parents separated when he was about 11. At first he lived with his mother in Sydney but when she moved to South Australia, taking the offender with her, he did not settle in. He only lasted two weeks there before returning to Sydney where he was effectively homeless for some time. Eventually, with the assistance of the authorities, he went to live with his older brother and his partner. He commenced to work and seemed to be doing well. He has largely worked in the building industry. After living with his brother for a while he moved to Sydney to live with his father. He then met Ms Barr, formed a relationship with her and they moved to Newcastle before eventually settling on the Central Coast.

9He was working at Hornsby Council but gave up that work in the context of the relationship with Ms Barr breaking up. Clearly that affected him to the extent that he did not value working as much as he had in the past. 

10He pleaded guilty in the Local Court to an offence of breaking and entering and whilst in the home assaulting Mr Wilkins, occasioning to him actual bodily harm in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he knew that there were people inside. When looking at that actual charge it is important to notice that there is a risk of double counting. He could not have assaulted someone inside unless there were people there. But it is also to be noted that he was in company at the time, which was a further aggravating feature. 

11The actual bodily harm occasioned to Mr Wilkins in physical terms appears to have been relatively minor. He suffered a bit of soreness and slightly swollen bottom lip with a small abrasion on it. But of course I am sure that Mr Wilkins, Ms Barr and the offender's son were less concerned about the physical injuries to Mr Wilkins than they were about the terribly frightening experience they had undergone.

12The offender has a relatively minor criminal history. Apart from one matter involving possession of a knife committed after this offence, his other offences were only driving offences, and there are not too many of them, but it is important to point out that this is his first offence of violence. 

13He has expressed his remorse and now accepts that he was wrong to think that the child was being harmed. He accepts, I guess, that he flew off the handle and over-reacted. 

14This was not some spur of the moment decision to actually commit the offence. He had plenty of time, between receiving the photographs and arriving at the home, to reflect on what he was going to do. He had plenty of time to contemplate other, more appropriate, ways of dealing with this matter. 

15As I say he now expresses his remorse for what he has done. Consistent with that expression of remorse is the early plea of guilty. That plea of guilty has a utilitarian benefit which will mean that the sentence I impose upon him is 25 percent less than it would otherwise have been and is one of a number of factors that have caused me to impose upon Mr Shiell a different form of sentence from that I would have otherwise contemplated.

16There are some aspects of this case where issues of vigilantism arise. People are not allowed to take the law into their own hands and where they do, the courts regard such offences as serious. But this is not a case where Mr Shiell was intent on punishing someone for what he perceived to be an injury to a stranger. At the time he committed this offence he genuinely believed that his son was at risk of harm from those inside the house. I imagine that almost every parent has overreacted at some time to what they perceive to be risk to their children. Not many of us I trust would commit a serious offence such as this but what led to Mr Shiell doing what he did was the emotional reaction he felt and the desire he felt to protect his son when he believed his son was at risk. That is a significant matter in assessing the likelihood that Mr Shiell will commit further offences of violence in the future. It is for that reason that I did not mention personal deterrence when I was discussing the important factors that I needed to consider earlier in these remarks. It is to be hoped that Mr Shiell's conduct on this occasion is a one-off.

17Notwithstanding there remains, as I mentioned before, the importance of general deterrence and punishment. Courts need to mark in a very concrete way the inappropriateness of conduct such as this and it has to be recognised that, in the circumstances of this case, imposing a suspended sentence on Mr Shiell does little by way of deterring others or punishing Mr Shiell.

18It cannot be denied that if Mr Shiell complies with the conditions of a bond imposed as part of a suspended sentence, then those in the community might regard him as having undergone little or no punishment. The expression ""He got off without punishment"" might be one used in the community if a s 12 suspended sentence were to result. As far as punishment is concerned, Mr Shiell would be required to obey the law for the term of his suspended sentence; something he is required to do anyway.

19At most I suppose it could be said that he is punished by knowing that if he breaks the law he will be sent to prison. I fully understand what the authorities in this state say about suspended sentences. They remain an option in the sentencing weaponry, despite other jurisdictions abandoning them recently, and I am not entitled to take an idiosyncratic view of what suspended sentences are, based on what I perceive to be the reality of those sentences. I am bound by the authorities in the Court of Criminal Appeal which I must apply. They tell me that a suspended sentence of imprisonment is a real punishment.

20The matter has been very finely balanced. What has persuaded me to accept the joint submission of the parties is the unusual circumstance in which this offence was committed. Mr Shiell was not trying to hit Mr Wilkins because Ms Barr had formed a new relationship. He did not break into the house to remonstrate with Ms Barr about their relationship having broken down. He did what he did to protect his son, foolishly as it turns out, but that was what motivated him and I repeat it is for that reason primarily that I will not send Mr Shiell into prison at this stage.

21The offender is convicted. He is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 18 months. Under s 12 of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act the execution of that sentence is suspended for the term of the sentence on condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond. The terms of that bond are that Mr Shiell is to be of good behaviour. He is to advise the Registrar of this court of any change in his residential address and he is to appear before this Court if called upon to do so at any time.

22Mr Shiell, Mr Booth appears before me quite regularly. I am sure he is going to tell you how close - because he knows me well - how close I was to sending you to gaol. So if you breach this bond I will have no hesitation in sending you to gaol. It is important therefore for you, for your benefit, that you do not breach the bond, you do not commit any criminal offences. You are starting a history of driving offences, that has got to stop too because committing another driving offence, driving whilst disqualified, will have you before me and a driving offence can put you in gaol. If you do end up there, they are terrible places, but you will only have yourself to blame.

		13 February 2014",2013-11-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2420756,R v Donald (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 290,"Judgment

1HIDDEN J: I agree with Latham J.

2LATHAM J: On 25 October 2013, this Court allowed the Crown appeal, quashed the sentence imposed on 26 April 2013 and re sentenced the respondent to 2 years imprisonment to date from 25 October 2013. The respondent's release to a recognisance release order was ordered to take effect on 25 October 2014.

3The Crown has since brought to the attention of the Court that the combined effect of ss 16 and 20(1)(a) and (b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) requires the Court to set a sum as security for the purposes of the recognisance release order.

4Section 20 relevantly provides :-

(1) Where a person is convicted of a federal offence or federal offences, the court before which he or she is convicted may, if it thinks fit:
(a) by order, release the person, without passing sentence on him or her, upon his or her giving security, with or without sureties, by recognizance or otherwise, to the satisfaction of the court, that he or she will comply with the following conditions:
.......................................................................... or
(b) sentence the person to imprisonment in respect of the offence or each offence but direct, by order, that the person be released, upon giving security of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) either forthwith or after he or she has served a specified period of imprisonment in respect of that offence or those offences that is calculated in accordance with subsection 19AF(1).


5The Crown's submission must be accepted, since the Court failed to comply with the terms of s 20. Section 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 allows the Court to re-open the proceedings, when the Court has failed to impose a penalty that is required by law, in order to correct the error by the amendment of the order. That provision is clearly directed to the circumstances of this case.

6 Accordingly, I propose the following amended orders :-

(1)The Crown appeal is allowed.

(2)The sentence imposed on 26 April 2013 is quashed.

(3)In lieu, the respondent is sentenced to 2 years imprisonment, commencing 25 October 2013, to be released on 25 October 2014 upon entering into a recognisance, self in the sum of $2000.00, to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months.

7ADAMSON J: I agree with Latham J.

		04 December 2013",2013-11-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2420867,Ngati v R [2013] NSWCCA 307,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL : I agree with Latham J.

2JOHNSON J : I agree with Latham J.

3LATHAM J : The applicant, Mata Glassie Ngati, applies for an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by Sides QC DCJ on 9 April 2009 for a specially aggravated break, enter and steal committed on 7 January 2007.

4The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. Following the applicant's plea of guilty, he received a non-parole period of 6 years and 7 months, commencing 19 September 2007 with a balance of term of 2 years and 5 months expiring on 18 September 2016.

5There is a single ground upon which the applicant seeks leave for an extension of time within which to appeal, namely that the judge erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period. This ground is now pressed on the basis of the decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 ; 244 CLR 120.

6For the reasons identified by this Court in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247, the applicant must establish that a substantial injustice would follow if the Court refused the grant of the extension of time and failed to deal with the appeal on its merits. In effect, this requires the Court to assess the prospects of success of the appeal, having regard also to the length of the delay, the reasons for it and the interests of the community. 

7The applicant has not previously lodged a notice of intention to appeal. The applicant contacted the review team in Legal Aid New South Wales on 22 November 2012. On 5 December 2012 the applicant was advised that his case was being reviewed. Between 19 February 2013 and 18 June 2013, the applicant's case was progressed internally by Legal Aid, including obtaining counsel's advice, seeking copies of exhibits and transcripts and preparing submissions. A notice of application for extension of time within which to appeal was filed on 28 June 2013.

8Having regard to this history, the only explanation for the delay is the applicant's awareness of the review process in relation to standard non-parole period offences. It would be reasonable to conclude that, but for the change in sentencing law brought about by Muldrock, neither the applicant nor his legal representatives at the time of sentence, considered the sentence infected by error or outside the appropriate range.

9The offence was a particularly serious example of aggravated break enter and steal. On 7 January 2007, the applicant and five other young men (three of whom were between the ages of 14 and 16, the remaining two being aged 20 and 21 respectively) discussed and executed a home invasion on domestic premises in Macquarie Fields, whilst armed. The applicant, then aged 32, directed the juveniles to the rear of the premises while he and the others remained at the front door. At about 6:30pm, the applicant knocked on the door and asked for directions from the 33-year-old female victim who answered. The applicant attempted to force entry as the victim opened the door, however she struggled and a male victim ran to the front door to assist her.

10At about this time the two juveniles who had gone to the rear of the house forced their way into the house. They were both armed with knives. The male victim was stabbed under the left armpit. The male victim and a juvenile struggled over the knife in the presence of the victim's 12-year-old son and the female victim. Another child aged 11 was also in the room.

11Meanwhile, the other juvenile unlocked the front door allowing the applicant and others to enter. The female victim attempted to use the phone but was threatened by one of the juveniles who held a knife to her throat and asked her to hand over the phone. After taking the phone, he again pointed the knife at her throat and asked where the money was. The male victim was kicked in the back and then forced to the floor. The knife was pressed to his face. He was repeatedly kicked in the head and ribs while his female partner screamed. The applicant stood over the male victim demanding money and then car keys. The male victim was then struck a number of times on the left knee with a mattock handle. A plasma TV and a number of Sony PlayStation games were stolen from the premises. The female victim managed to record the registration number of the vehicle.

12After leaving the premises, an offender reported the car as stolen. However, following a pursuit, the police were able to stop the vehicle carrying the two juveniles. The fingerprints of all of the offenders were located within the vehicle. On 27 April 2007 the applicant declined to be interviewed but provided a buccal swab and allowed the police to photograph him. On 12 July 2007 the applicant was interviewed but denied any knowledge of the offence and said that he was not in the Macquarie Fields area at the time.

13At the time of the offence, the applicant was unlawfully at large, having been sentenced in his absence on 4 May 2007 to a six-month non-parole period for a number of larceny offences. The applicant had failed to appear on a number of occasions in relation to these offences. In addition, the applicant was on parole for robbery offences. The applicant's parole was originally revoked on 6 March 2006, however he was again released to parole on 26 March 2006. Parole was again revoked on 3 November 2006, however the applicant was not returned to custody until 19 January 2007. The balance of parole was to expire on 6 April 2008. The judge correctly noted that the offence was aggravated by these factors.

14After setting out the circumstances of the offence, the judge reviewed the applicant's subjective case. His Honour then returned to the objective gravity of the offence, noting that, in addition to the commission of the offence in the knowledge that persons were in the home, every circumstance of aggravation provided for by s 105A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 was present in the offence, namely, that the offenders were armed, the offence was committed in company, corporal violence was used, actual bodily harm was inflicted and the victims were deprived of their liberty. The circumstance of special aggravation charged against the applicant was the wounding of the male victim. The judge observed that the violence was prolonged and gratuitous.

15Immediately thereafter, the judge said :-

In the court's view, having considered the offence in accordance with R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, this offence falls above the mid range. Although falling above the mid range the court treated the standard non-parole period as a type of benchmark or guidepost.

16This constituted the one and only reference to the standard non-parole period in the entire remarks on sentence. The judge went on to refer to the victim impact statements, the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, questions of parity and other relevant authorities. Finally, the judge concluded that a sentence of 9 years' imprisonment was appropriate to the circumstances of the case. Issues of totality that arose from the commission of the larceny offences and the applicant's return to custody for breach of parole determined that a degree of partial accumulation was necessary. On this basis the judge found special circumstances and then pronounced sentence.

17The height of the applicant's submission on the sole ground of appeal is that :-

It appears the sentencing judge may well have offended [Muldrock] ... in that he was of the view that it was mandatory to make a finding of where within the notional range the offence fell. It is further submitted that the ""neatness of the mathematics"", the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics, and comparable authorities all strongly suggest that the standard non-parole period had ""determinative significance"" in the sentencing of the applicant.

18With respect, this submission invites the Court to draw an inference that is not supported by the judge's comprehensive reasons. At its heart, it seeks support from matters external to the reasons and relies upon retroactive analysis. There is no indication anywhere in the remarks that the judge considered it mandatory to determine where the offence fell in the notional range. Considering the offence in accordance with Way does not, of itself, support that conclusion. There is nothing in Muldrock which prohibits a court from determining whether an offence falls within the mid range of objective gravity, rather the prohibition lies in adopting a two-stage approach to sentencing, that is by commencing with the standard non-parole period and oscillating around that figure, depending on the presence or absence of aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

19The applicant's reference to the ""neatness of the mathematics"" derives from Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50. However, the submission is, for my part, inscrutable. The applicant commences by noting that the notional starting point, prior to the application of the discount for the plea of guilty (25%), was ""somewhere in excess of 12 years with a non-parole period of approximately 9 years."" The applicant then goes on to say that ""it was possibly even higher having regard to the aggravating features that the applicant was on parole and bail at the time of the commission of the subject offence."" Finally, the applicant concludes by asserting that ""a notional non-parole period of 9 years generally fits the description as 'falling above the mid range'.

20There is nothing ""neat"" about these calculations. On the contrary, they acknowledge that the presence of several aggravating factors may well have disposed the judge to a notional sentence of more than 12 years. It is of no moment that the judge did not specify that notional sentence. His reasons disclose an application of the discount for the plea of guilty, and a consideration of all the relevant factors, objective and subjective, before determining a head sentence of 9 years. Given that the standard non-parole period is 7 years, that the offence was considered one falling above the mid range and the non-parole period actually imposed was 6 years and 7 months, it is difficult to discern how the standard non-parole period had ""determinative significance.""

21In my view, there is no merit in this ground. I propose that the extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal be refused.

		09 December 2013",2013-12-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2420892,New South Wales Crime Commission v Brendon Phong Tran (No. 2) [2013] NSWSC 1854,"Judgment


1This is a further application in the matter of the New South Wales Crime Commission v Brendon Tran. On 9 September 2013 Garling J made restraining orders in these proceedings in respect of the interests of Defendants in property specified in those orders.

2The Plaintiff now seeks to amend the summons to make claims of unexplained wealth orders against three other persons associated with Mr Tran. Those persons are Phi Phuoc Vo, Kim Christine Tran and Donna Lee Tran. The amended summons would add those persons as Defendants in the proceedings. 

3On the present motion restraining orders under s 10A of the Act are sought against those persons.

4The application is supported by an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 10 December 2013. Mr Spark suspects that Brendon Tran has engaged in serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities as defined in s 6 of the Act; such activities being the supply of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 and dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage by deception contrary to s 192B of the Crimes Act. All of these offences are serious criminal offences pursuant to s 6(2)D of the Act.

5The suspicions of Mr Spark are based on the matters more particularly set out in paragraph 9 of his affidavit. Mr Spark also suspects that each of the three proposed further Defendants have acquired serious crime derived property within the meaning of s 9 of the Act because of the serious crime related activity of Brendon Tran. 

6In relation to Phi Vo, the suspicion is based on the grounds set out in paragraph 11 of Mr Spark's affidavit. In respect of Kim Tran, the suspicion is based on the matters set out in paragraph 15 of his affidavit and in respect of Donna Tran, the suspicion is based on the matters set out in paragraph 18 of the affidavit.

7Section 10A(5) of the Act requires an order to be made if the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for Mr Spark's suspicion. I have read the material that Mr Spark refers to in his affidavit. The matters in the documents that he has annexed, if true, are sufficient to show that the offences he has identified have been committed. The documents and facts recorded plainly afford reasonable grounds for the suspicions deposed to by Mr Spark.

8Section 10A(4) enables notice to be given to the proposed Defendants before the order is made if the Court thinks fit. Mr Spark has deposed to the speed at which it is possible for notified parties to dispose of or attempt to dispose of property to defeat orders under the Act. In particular, I note what Mr Spark says in paragraph 23 of his affidavit concerning the existing freezing orders under Western Australian comparable legislation and his notification that the Western Australian Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions considers it now appropriate to allow the present Plaintiff to lead the confiscation action against Mr Tran.

9For all of those reasons, I am satisfied that it is appropriate not to give notice to the proposed Defendants before the order is made. They have their rights under s 10C of the Act.

10I am satisfied that it is appropriate that the proposed Defendants should be added as Defendants in the proceedings and that the summons should be amended accordingly.

11I have already indicated that the suspicions held by Mr Spark have been held on a reasonable basis and that the restraining orders must therefore be made.

2420965,QBE Insurance (Australia) Ltd v Miller [2013] NSWCA 442,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  On 18 May 2008 Ms Leah Miller (who should be treated as the first respondent) was involved in a motor vehicle accident.  She claimed damages from the other driver.  The third party insurer, QBE Insurance (Australia) Ltd (""QBE"") disputed the degree of her asserted permanent impairment; the dispute was referred to the Motor Accidents Authority of New South Wales (""the Authority"") for determination.  In February 2010 the medical dispute was referred to assessors for determination.  Assessments were separately made of her physical and psychological symptoms.  Relevantly for present purposes, a certificate was issued on 15 June 2011 stating that her psychological injuries caused by the accident gave rise to a permanent impairment greater than 10%.
2On 28 July 2011 QBE lodged an application for a further assessment.  A party to a medical dispute is entitled to seek a further assessment, in accordance with Pt 3.4 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW), ""but only on the grounds of the deterioration of the injury or additional relevant information about the injury"": s 62(1)(a).  QBE submitted that additional relevant information had become available.   While the section refers to a referral ""by any party"" in sub-s (1), sub-s (1B) requires that the referral to a specified assessor be by the proper officer of the Authority.  In the present case, the proper officer refused to make a referral for further assessment.  QBE sought to challenge that decision, seeking a quashing order under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW).  At trial, Rothman J dismissed the application: QBE Insurance (Australia) Ltd v Motor Accidents Authority of New South Wales [2013] NSWSC 549; 63 MVR 470.  QBE has appealed.
Statutory scheme(a) whether a reviewable decision3Whether or not the primary judge was correct depends, in part, on the correct approach to judicial review of the decision of the proper officer.  That in turn depends on the proper construction of the legislation, having regard to the principles governing judicial review.  Because the statutory language is somewhat awkward, it is convenient to set out s 62 in full:
62 Referral of matter for further medical assessment
(1) A matter referred for assessment under this Part may be referred again on one or more further occasions in accordance with this Part:
(a) by any party to the medical dispute, but only on the grounds of the deterioration of the injury or additional relevant information about the injury, or(b) by a court or claims assessor.
(1A) A matter may not be referred again for assessment by a party to the medical dispute on the grounds of deterioration of the injury or additional relevant information about the injury unless the deterioration or additional information is such as to be capable of having a material effect on the outcome of the previous assessment.
(1B) Referral of a matter under this section is to be by referral to the member of staff of the Authority who is designated by the Authority for the purpose (in this Part referred to as the proper officer of the Authority).
(2) A certificate as to a matter referred again for assessment prevails over any previous certificate as to the matter to the extent of any inconsistency.
4The awkwardness arises from the imposition of new sub-s (1B), providing for referral ""to"" the proper officer of the Authority, without the express conferral on the officer of any particular power, let alone a statement of criteria by which the power should be exercised.  Nevertheless, it has been accepted that the section impliedly confers power on the proper officer to refer the matter to a medical assessor on a ground identified in s 62(1)(a), if the condition set out in sub-s (1A) is satisfied: Rodger v De Gelder [2011] NSWCA 97; 80 NSWLR 594 at [70] (Beazley JA, McColl and Macfarlan JJA agreeing).  
5The first question concerns the power of the Court to review the decision of the proper officer to refer, or refuse to refer, a particular application.  On the basis that the decision of the proper officer constitutes a gateway, or condition precedent, to the carrying out of a further medical assessment, that decision is reviewable.  While the proper officer does not make any recommendation with respect to the merits of the application, the fact that the officer stands between the applicant and a determination of the medical dispute between the applicant and the other party in relation to a civil claim, renders the decision reviewable in the terms explained in The Queen v Collins; Ex parte ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd (1976) 50 ALJR 471.  A distinction between a report of a Royal Commission which does not affect legal rights directly and a precondition to an exercise of power which does affect legal rights was explained by Stephen J at 473:
""The reported conclusions of the Commission no doubt serve to inform the mind of government and may in consequence to a greater or lesser extent be instrumental in shaping the course of future legislative or executive initiatives, but they neither directly determine, or of their own force affect, right.  Nor does the reporting of particular conclusions satisfy some condition precedent to the exercise of power which will in turn affect rights or otherwise give rise to legal consequences.  The making of the report does not place rights 'in a new jeopardy' or 'subject them to a new hazard', as Kitto J thought was done by the Inspector's reports in Testro Bros Pty Ltd v Tait (1963) 109 CLR 353 at pp 369, 370.""
6In the present case the decision of the proper officer does satisfy a condition precedent to the exercise of power which will in turn affect legal rights.  Accordingly the decision is reviewable.  This view was accepted in Rodger v De Gelder at [70].
(b) content of decision7The next question was to identify the content of the decision.  First, it was necessary for the proper officer to identify the information relied upon by the applicant party.  In relation to a medical assessment, that information could have a range of characteristics.  It might include a record of symptoms at a time prior to the accident, or a diagnosis of a condition extant prior to the accident.  Another aspect of the information might be the mere fact of a particular doctor making a diagnosis or recording a history.  These different aspects may be significant in ascertaining whether the information was properly described as ""additional"", ""relevant"" and ""capable of having a material effect on the outcome of the previous assessment"".  For example, even information which was available to the previous assessor might constitute ""additional"" information if the assessor had not accepted it on the basis that the source was unreliable, whereas the new source might be deemed more reliable.
8The trial judge treated each of the characteristics as requiring separate consideration by the proper officer.  Thus, he held that the proper officer had rejected certain information as not being ""additional"", in circumstances where that conclusion was not open.  However, he found that there was no vitiating error in the decision of the proper officer, because she had decided that the information was, in any event, not capable of materially affecting the previous assessment, a conclusion which was not tainted by legal error.
9Both parties before the Court accepted, at least for the purposes of their principal arguments, the approach of the primary judge.  Thus, QBE submitted that, if the proper officer had concluded (wrongly) that there was no additional information, her conclusion as to materiality must also be flawed.  The Attorney accepted both the error identified by the primary judge and the logic of his final conclusion, based upon the need to satisfy each of the separate elements.
10For reasons which will be explained, it is by no means clear that the proper officer approached the exercise in the segmented manner just described.  In principle, there was no need for her to do so.  While it would be true that information which was not in any relevant respect ""additional"" to that already considered by the assessor, could not affect the outcome, it did not follow that the proper officer was required to work methodically through the characteristics as if they were each separate and independent of the others.  On the contrary, they are clearly interrelated.  That which is capable of affecting an outcome must be relevant; further, that which is properly described as ""additional"" must also be relevant.
(c) nature of decision11A critical issue in the present case is the nature of the review which may be undertaken of the decision of the proper officer.  That in turn depends upon the nature of the decision itself.  Section 62, as originally enacted, contained only sub-ss (1) and (2).  The language of sub-s (1), permitting a matter to be ""referred again"" echoes the language of s 60 which deals with initial referrals in the following terms:
60 Medical assessment procedures
(1) A medical dispute may be referred to the Authority for assessment under this Part by either party to the dispute or by a court or claims assessor.
(2) The Authority is to arrange for the dispute to be referred to one or more medical assessors.
12That section envisages referral by a party to the Authority, which then arranges an internal referral to an appropriate medical assessor or assessors.  That language was not repeated in s 62, which may have led to the amendments inserting sub-ss (1A) and (1B), said by the Minister to be by way of clarification, by the Motor Accidents Compensation Amendment (Claims and Dispute Resolution) Act 2007 (NSW), Sch 1 [30].  
13That which may be referred for assessment under Pt 3.4 (for the purposes of s 62(1)) is a ""medical dispute"", identified in s 60(1) and defined to mean ""a disagreement or issue to which this Part applies"": s 57.  Such matters are identified in s 58 in the following terms:
58 Application
(1) This Part applies to a disagreement between a claimant and an insurer about any of the following matters (referred to in this Part as medical assessment matters):
(a) whether the treatment provided or to be provided to the injured person was or is reasonable and necessary in the circumstances,(b) whether any such treatment relates to the injury caused by the motor accident,(c) (Repealed)(d) whether the degree of permanent impairment of the injured person as a result of the injury caused by the motor accident is greater than 10%.(e) (Repealed)
(2) This Part also applies to any issue arising about such a matter in proceedings before a court or in connection with the assessment of a claim by a claims assessor.
14In this case, the relevant matter was whether the degree of permanent impairment exceeded 10%: s 58(1)(d).  Unless that figure were exceeded, no damages could be awarded for non-economic loss: s 131.
15Section 62(1) deals separately with a referral by a party and referrals by a court or claims assessor: in the latter case there are no constraints on the circumstances in which a referral for further assessment may be made.  In such a case the function of the proper officer, pursuant to sub-s (1B), will be limited to the administrative steps of identifying an available assessor (or assessors) and arranging for the relevant material to be provided to that person or persons.
16Where the application is made by a party, there are alternative grounds available, namely the deterioration of the injury (which in practice will be relied upon by the claimant) or the disclosure of additional relevant information about the injury (which may be relied upon by either party).  In both cases, sub-s (1A) imposes an additional requirement, namely that the deterioration or additional information is ""such as to be capable of having a material effect on the outcome of the previous assessment"".  Although that restriction qualifies the right of a party to seek a further assessment, it was common ground that the conditions contained in sub-s (1)(a), as further qualified in sub-s (1A), were to be considered by the proper officer in determining whether or not to refer a matter to an assessor for a further assessment.  The critical issue was the proper formulation of the precondition to referral for a further assessment.
17If it is the state of satisfaction of the officer which is the precondition to referral, that satisfaction can be reviewed for relevant legal error.  On the other hand, if the precondition is the proper characterisation of the material relied on, then the aggrieved party can invite a judge to determine, in judicial review proceedings, whether or not that precondition is satisfied.  It is sometimes said that each of these approaches involves a ""jurisdictional fact"", a categorisation adopted by Gummow J in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21; 197 CLR 611 at [130].  However, where the precondition is the state  of satisfaction of an officer, the appellation ""jurisdictional fact"" is misleading.  To point up the difference, where the precondition depends on the existence of primary facts, the descriptor of ""objective facts"" is used, although this merely means that the facts must be established to the satisfaction of the reviewing court, on the evidence before it, regardless of the opinion of the decision-maker: see Timbarra Protection Coalition Inc v Ross Mining NL (1999) 46 NSWLR 55 at 64 (Spigelman CJ); D'Amore v Independent Commission Against Corruption [2013] NSWCA 187; 303 ALR 242 at [241].  
18The correct identification of the precondition depends upon the proper construction of s 62, read in the context of the whole of Pt 3.4 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act, entitled ""Medical Assessment"".  Section 58 (set out above at [13]) provides that Part 3.4 applies to ""a disagreement between a claimant and an insurer"" about specified medical assessment matters.
19The consequences and ""status"" of a medical assessment are provided for in s 61:
61 Status of medical assessments
(1) The medical assessor or assessors to whom a medical dispute is referred is or are to give a certificate as to the matters referred for assessment.
(2) Any such certificate as to a medical assessment matter is conclusive evidence as to the matters certified in any court proceedings or in any assessment by a claims assessor in respect of the claim concerned.
(3)  (Repealed)
(4) In any court proceedings, the court may (despite anything to the contrary in this section) reject a certificate as to all or any of the matters certified in it, on the grounds of denial of procedural fairness to a party to the proceedings in connection with the issue of the certificate, but only if the court is satisfied that admission of the certificate as to the matter or matters concerned would cause substantial injustice to that party.
(5) If a certificate as to any matter is rejected under subsection (4), the court is to refer that matter again for assessment under this Part and adjourn the proceedings until a further certificate is given and admitted in evidence in the proceedings.
(6) However, if a certificate as to whether or not the degree of permanent impairment of the injured person is greater than 10% is rejected under subsection (4), the court may, if it considers it appropriate, substitute a determination of the court as to the degree of permanent impairment of the injured person (assessed by the court in accordance with section 133) instead of referring that matter again for assessment under this Part.
(7) Except as provided by subsection (6), a court may not substitute its own determination as to any medical assessment matter.
(8) This section:
(a) does not prevent a court from referring a matter again for assessment under this Part (as provided for by section 62), and(b) does not require a court to refer a matter again for assessment under this Part if the matter is not a medical assessment matter.
(9) A certificate is to set out the reasons for any finding by the medical assessor or assessors as to any matter certified in the certificate in respect of which the certificate is conclusive evidence.
...
(11) If a medical assessor is satisfied that a certificate under this section contains an obvious error, the medical assessor may issue a replacement certificate to correct the error.
20The resolution of disputes as to ""medical assessment matters"" is thus conferred upon medical assessors, subject to the limited control of the trial court, as reflected in s 61(4) and (6).  It would appear that the power to refer for further medical assessment, not limited to the grounds set out in paragraph (a) of s 62(1), conferred on ""a court"" by paragraph (b), is intended to complement the provision in s 61(5).  (The role of a claims assessor is less clear, although, as recognised in s 58(2), the Part envisages that issues as to medical assessment may require referral by a claims assessor.)
21It is also relevant to note the separate power of ""review"" provided by s 63.  The relevant provisions for present purposes are as follows:
63 Review of medical assessment by review panel
(1) A party to a medical dispute may apply to the proper officer of the Authority to refer a medical assessment under this Part by a single medical assessor to a review panel of medical assessors for review.
(2) An application for the referral of a medical assessment to a review panel may only be made on the grounds that the assessment was incorrect in a material respect....(3) The proper officer of the Authority is to arrange for any such application to be referred to a panel of at least 3 medical assessors, but only if the proper officer is satisfied that there is reasonable cause to suspect that the medical assessment was incorrect in a material respect having regard to the particulars set out in the application.
22Reliance was placed in the course of the hearing on aspects of the Motor Accident Authority Medical Guidelines (""Medical Assessment Guidelines""), which are given statutory force in relation to medical assessments by s 65 in the following terms:
65 MAA monitoring and oversight
(1) Medical assessments under this Part are subject to relevant provisions of MAA Medical Guidelines relating to the procedures for the referral of disputes for assessment or review of assessments and the procedure for assessment.
23The Medical Assessment Guidelines state that the proper officer must undertake an ""allocation review ... in accordance with Chapter 9"": cl 14.3.  Chapter 14 further provides that when conducting that review, the proper officer ""is to determine whether the application is suitable for referral for further assessment"".  The Guidelines then direct the proper officer to have regard to certain matters and also give some guidance as to the meaning of ""material"" in s 62(1A).  Further, the Guidelines in Chapter 14 provide:
""14.7 If the Proper Officer is not satisfied that the deterioration of the injury or the additional relevant information about the injury would have a material effect on the outcome of the application, the Proper Officer may dismiss the application.
14.8 The Proper Officer is to provide the parties with brief written reasons for the decision at the same time as, or as part of the notification to the parties, of the outcome of the Allocation Review as required by clause 9.2.""
24Clause 14.7, which empowers the proper officer to dismiss the application if not satisfied as to the precondition in s 62(1A), is curious: the section suggests that the ""application"" must be dismissed in such circumstances.  Further, although cl 14.8 requires ""brief written reasons for the decision"", there is no suggestion that failure to give reasons would invalidate the decision.  (A challenge to the adequacy of the reasons given by the proper officer in this case was abandoned.)
25The Attorney General, appearing by leave as amicus, in the absence of an active contradictor, submitted that the precondition to the referral for a further assessment depended on the satisfaction of the proper officer as to the qualifications imposed by s 62(1A).  Although, as respondent in earlier proceedings in this Court, QBE had taken the same view, in this case, somewhat opportunistically, it contended that s 62(1A) identified jurisdictional facts which, if satisfied, permitted and indeed required referral for further assessment, at least in the absence of any discretionary consideration to the contrary, none being identified by the proper officer.
26QBE relied on the absence of any statutory provision indicating that qualification for a further assessment depended on the ""satisfaction"" of the proper officer as to the requisite circumstances, but rather provided a straightforward statement of the elements required to be satisfied.
27The principal factors favouring a condition referrable to the state of satisfaction of the proper officer were the following:
(a) the characteristics of the information referred to in the statutory provision all involved matters requiring evaluative judgment; (b) the characteristics were essentially factual, involving no legal element;(c) if the relevant characteristics were satisfied, there would usually be no further matters to be assessed by the proper officer and thus the power of referral would, if challenged, fall to be determined by a judge of the Supreme Court in judicial review proceedings;(d) the inconvenience of having such matters liable to determination by the Supreme Court, and(e) the purpose of providing for medical assessment without dependence on the procedural rigours (and expense) of a civil trial with expert witnesses.
28There is no doubt that these factors constitute powerful considerations in favour of the view that Parliament did not intend questions of relevance and materiality to be determined, as matters of fact, by the Supreme Court.  While none of the factors individually was determinative, together they were highly persuasive.  
29QBE did not dispute that the question was ultimately one of statutory construction, nor that inconvenience (or disfunctionality in the language of Aronson and Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (5th ed Law Book Co, 2013) at [4.560]) was a powerful consideration: Woolworths Ltd v Pallas Newco Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 422; 61 NSWLR 707 at [63] (Spigelman CJ); Timbarra Protection Coalition at [91]; Warehouse Group (Australia) Pty Ltd v Woolworths Ltd [2005] NSWCA 269; 141 LGERA 376 at [134]-[135].  On the other hand, QBE noted that there were seminal cases in which, despite inconvenience and the need to make evaluative judgments, the courts had found a statutory intention to create jurisdictional facts, including the decision in City of Enfield v Development Assessment Commission [2000] HCA 5; 199 CLR 135.
30Although it is undoubtedly correct to pay close attention to the language of the statute, and accept that express reference to the ""satisfaction"" or ""opinion"" of a specified decision-maker would be a significant consideration in favour of a finding that the precondition to the exercise of a power is the officer's state of mind, nevertheless this factor has limited weight in circumstances where there is no express conferral of statutory power on the proper officer.  It is only by implication that one identifies the role or function of the proper officer in respect of an application under s 62.
31It has long been accepted that matters requiring evaluative judgment are likely to be intended by Parliament to be determined, subject to ensuring compliance with legal parameters, by the repository of the power: Australian Heritage Commission v Mount Isa Mines Ltd [1997] HCA 10; 187 CLR 297.  If the statutory preconditions involved questions of law, which is not the present case, a different presumption might arise: Plaintiff M70/2011 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [Malaysian Declaration Case] [2011] HCA 32; 244 CLR 144 at [116] (Gummow, Hayne, Crennan and Bell JJ).  A further consideration in the present case is that control of the medical assessment process has been largely, though not entirely, removed from the trial court.  If it were thought appropriate to review the findings of the proper officer under s 62, on the merits of the application, one might have expected that function to be conferred on the prospective trial court.  The complaint of failing to refer the application for further medical assessment is not far from a complaint of procedural unfairness which, if made good, would entitle the trial court to reject a certificate, if that course were necessary to prevent substantial injustice: s 61(4).
32There is, as the Attorney emphasised, a further factor which militates strongly in favour of the position adopted by him, namely the authority of this Court in Rodger v De Gelder.  In discussing the availability of relief by way of judicial review, Beazley JA said that it was unnecessary for her to consider the further issue ""relating to jurisdictional facts"" which had been identified at [62]: see [71].  However, in order to allow the appeal, she also dealt with a notice of contention.  Beazley JA noted that the second contention raised by the respondent was that ""the report of Dr Maxwell was not additional information as found by [the trial judge in the judicial review proceedings]"".  Having rejected the suggestion that the decision was ""illogical, irrational or lacking a basis in findings or inferences of fact supported on logical grounds"", Beazley JA proceeded to deal with the second contention which called in issue a factual finding.  She held at [99]:
""First, I agree with the trial judge that Dr Maxwell's report could constitute additional information, notwithstanding that in the original assessment and review the assessors had available medical evidence relating to causation.  That was a matter for decision by the Proper Officer, first, as to whether it was additional information and secondly, whether the matter should be referred for further review.""
33Macfarlan JA said that the respondent had contended that the decision of the proper officer was ""wrong, and was illogical and irrational"": at [112].  He continued:
""[113] The decision to refer a claimant for a further medical assessment is made by an administrative officer and, whilst not a purely procedural step, is nevertheless not the ultimate step in the relevant process (that being the further medical assessment itself).  Bearing this in mind, my view is that on the proper construction of s 62(1A), the capacity of the additional information to affect a further medical assessment is a matter for the subjective satisfaction of the Proper Officer.  It is not necessary that that capacity exist as a matter of objective fact. 
[114] In these circumstances the grounds available for successful judicial review are limited (see Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMDS [2010] HCA 16; (2010) 240 CLR 611).  In my view none have been established here.  The first respondent's submissions do not amount to any more than an attempt to contest the merits of the Proper Officer's decision concerning the relevant capacity.  They do not establish that the decision was irrational, illogical or otherwise liable to review on one of the grounds to which reference is made in SZMDS.""
34It is tolerably clear that both Beazley JA and (more explicitly) Macfarlan JA, declined to review the merits of the decision of the proper officer.  (McColl JA agreed with both judgments, suggesting no difference of approach between them on issues necessary for the decision.)  It may thus be seen that the Court was unanimous in rejecting the proposition that it was for the Court, rather than the proper officer, to characterise Dr Maxwell's report as ""additional information"".
35The Attorney's submissions should be accepted: the authority impliedly conferred on the proper officer to refer an application for further assessment to a medical assessor depended on the satisfaction of the proper officer as to the requirements set out in sub-s (1A).
(d) standard of review36Once it is accepted that the characterisation of the information is a matter to be considered in the first instance by the proper officer and not one to be determined by this Court afresh on a judicial review application, the review proceedings are limited to determining whether the proper officer's opinion has been properly formed according to law: Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24; 135 CLR 110 at 118-119 (Gibbs J); D'Amore at [220].  The critical question is thus ""whether the determination was irrational, illogical and not based on findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds"": Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32; 78 ALJR 992 at [38] (Gummow and Hayne JJ).  Further, as explained by Latham CJ in The Queen v Connell; Ex parte Hetton Bellbird Collieries Ltd [1944] HCA 42; 69 CLR 407 at 432:
""If the opinion which was in fact formed was reached by taking into account irrelevant considerations or by otherwise misconstruing the terms of the relevant legislation, then it must be held that the opinion required has not been formed.  In that event the basis for the exercise of power is absent, just as if it were shown that the opinion was arbitrary, capricious, irrational, or not bona fide.""
37Such standards set the jurisdictional parameters of the power conferred on the officer.  QBE also relied upon error of law on the face of the record as a basis for setting aside the determination of the proper officer.  That approach involved a number of propositions which were not adequately explored.  For example, it assumed that the ""record"" to be reviewed for legal error included all of the material before the proper officer, together with proper officer's reasons.  So far as the reasons were concerned, counsel called in aid s 69(4) of the Supreme Court Act which provides that ""the face of the record includes the reasons expressed by the court or tribunal for its ultimate determination"".  However, the proper officer was clearly not a ""court"" for the purposes of the section and there was no discussion as to whether she was properly to be characterised as a ""tribunal"": cf Masters v McCubbery [1996] 1 VR 635, dealing with the equivalent provision in the Administrative Law Act 1978 (Vic), which has a definition of ""tribunal"".  Nor was attention paid to the scope of the phrase ""ultimate determination"".  When pressed, counsel for QBE submitted that it might not be necessary to rely on s 69(4) and that the common law would recognise the application by QBE, together with the attached documentation and the reasons of the proper officer, into which the decision was incorporated, as constituting the ""record"".  The cases relied upon, however, included Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58; 184 CLR 163 (dealing with an inferior court, but discussing tribunals) and R v Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal; Ex parte Shaw [1952] 1 KB 338 (dealing with a statutory tribunal).  Further consideration is required in order to determine how these principles apply to the officer of an authority performing a gateway function in filtering applications for further assessment.  If the requirement that there be a ""record"" is to be ignored or deprived of content, all administrative decisions will be reviewable for any kind of error of law.  Whether or not that approach should be adopted as a matter of policy, it is not the current basis for judicial review under s 69.
38These questions need not be pursued, because QBE ultimately did not rely upon an error of law which could not properly be characterised as jurisdictional error, which is a basis for review requiring no reference to a ""record"".
Application of principles39The refusal by the proper officer to refer QBE's application for further assessment was accompanied by brief written reasons, in compliance with the Medical Assessment Guidelines, cl 14.8.  The reasons stated that the officer had read the material provided by the parties and expressed her conclusion in the following terms at the outset:
""I am not satisfied that there is additional relevant information about the injury such as to be capable of having a material effect on the outcome of the previous assessment as required by s 62(1A) of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999.""
40The substance of the reasons may be set out in full and were as follows:
""The applicant/insurer has lodged the application on the basis that there is additional information about the injury and has provided the following documents:
● Medical records of Northwest Health● Medical records of Dr Knipe
The insurer submits that the information in the report of Dr Knipe is supportive of the view of Dr Potter and confirms the claimant's condition pre-dating the accident.
Whilst the medical records of North West Health and Dr Knipe were not available to the MAS Assessor, the information regarding the claimant's pre-accident psychological history was already considered by the MAS Assessor.  The MAS Assessor has considered the reports of Dr Potter (Psychiatrist) and Dr Badenhorst as summarised on pages 9 and 10 of the MAS certificate dated 15 June 2011.
In his report dated 26 June 2009, Dr Potter states that 'She presents now with some features of depression ... which is more consistent with the struggle in life and relationships reflecting a disturbed and disrupted early development ... She described having [been] depressed in high school ... was prescribed the antidepressant, Zoloft.  She continued explaining that she had seen ""another doctor who said I had bipolar disorder"".'
Dr [Bradenhorst's] report dated 4 June 2008 indicated that the claimant has a Bipolar affective disorder.
The information that the claimant has previously engaged in self-harm as an adolescent has been indicated in the report of psychologist Kelly Ritchie which has been considered by the MAS Assessor.
The information in the additional documents provided by the insurer are in similar terms with the previous reports considered by the MAS Assessor.  Accordingly, I am not satisfied that the above information is additional and relevant or such as to be capable of having a material effect on the outcome of the previous assessment.""
41QBE's challenge to these reasons focused on three propositions.  
42The first, characterised as a misconstruction of the legislation, a failure to carry out the statutory task and a failure to consider relevant information, asserted that the proper officer had focused on ""a particular topic"", namely the claimant's pre-accident psychological history, which had been considered by the assessor, and rejected the further information as not being ""additional"" because it addressed the same topic, without regard to its content.
43The second point, which can conveniently be considered in conjunction with the first, was that the proper officer had not considered the submissions in which QBE had identified the particular information which it said was additional, relevant and capable of affecting the outcome, by reference to particular aspects of Dr Knipe's report and the material from North West Health.  
44Thirdly, rejecting the approach adopted by the primary judge, QBE submitted that the proper officer had determined separately that the information supplied was not ""additional and relevant"" and that it was not capable of having a material effect on the previous assessment.  It followed, QBE submitted, that it was fallacious for the trial judge to treat the finding that there was no additional information (which he held to be legally flawed) as severable from the finding that the information was not capable of having a material effect on the previous assessment.  The first finding may have infected the second and, accordingly, the decision should have been quashed.
45QBE challenged the conclusions of the primary judge that the proper officer ""understood the question that she was required to ask"", ""took into account all relevant considerations"" and ""did not misapprehend the nature or limits of the powers she was performing"": at [41] and [46].  QBE accepted, and indeed relied on, the findings of the primary judge that the content of the medical records on which QBE based its application for further assessment contained ""greater particularity to the extent of the pre-existing injuries"" and that the officer's decision that the records did not provide ""additional and relevant"" information was not open: at [77]-[79].  However, on the question of materiality, QBE submitted that the proper officer had failed to have regard to the fact that the information was ""additional"", a factor which, it might be inferred, followed from a misunderstanding as to the function conferred on her, despite formal statements in her reasons, reflecting purported application of the section.
46The medical certificate, dated 15 June 2011, which resulted from the first assessment was in the following terms:
""The following injuries caused by the motor accident give rise to a permanent impairment which IS GREATER THAN 10%: 
● major depressive disorder● posttraumatic stress disorder● alcohol dependence.""
47The written submission by QBE to the proper officer set out an extract from the medical assessment which read as follows:
""Ms Miller has symptoms of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder.  She also has alcohol dependence.  Given her report that her symptoms that her symptoms began after the accident, I believe her conditions were caused by the accident.  Her conditions are inter-related.  Separating from her fiancée around August or September 2009 aggravated and perpetuated her symptoms.  I did not obtain a history of bipolar disorder.""
48The submission then set out a number of extracts from the newly obtained documents and concluded with the following passage:
""The insurer submits that this further information clearly constitutes additional relevant information about the injury which is capable of having material effect on the outcome of the assessment of Assessor Walker.  The confirmation that the claimant had been diagnosed with depression and borderline personality disorder in 2006, had ceased medication in 2007, had issues of excess alcohol consumption in 2006 and had relationship issues pre-dating the motor vehicle accident are all capable of causing the Assessor to revise his findings on causation and to reach a view similar to that formed by Dr Potter; namely; that her psychiatric presentation is related to her general life struggles and underlying personality and are not specifically related to the motor vehicle accident.""
49As the submission conceded, the assessor had available a report from Dr Brian Potter, psychiatrist, dated 26 June 2008.  That report was summarised by the assessor in the section entitled ""Review of documentation"" at paragraph 9.  The assessor also had a report from Dr Louisa Badenhorst, referred to at paragraph 13. 
50Against this background, it is convenient to address the submission that the proper officer failed to refer to important new information, as identified by QBE, demonstrating that before the accident the claimant (a) consumed "" excess alcohol"", (b) had been prescribed (but ceased taking) medication for diagnosed psychological conditions and (c) had had problems with her fiancé.  
51The difficulty for QBE was that Dr Potter had reported a ""history of alcohol intake"", which could attract the diagnosis of substance (alcohol) abuse if there were more reliable information; a ""struggle in life and relationships reflecting a disturbed and disrupted early development""; ""features of depression or unhappiness reflecting a struggle in life and relationships requiring psychotherapeutic help""; ""a complex developmental history and a past history of treatment with antidepressants from two different doctors"": p 12.  Dr Potter also said that the claimant had reported being prescribed an antidepressant, Zoloft, and had been given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.  She reported to him (as he recorded) having taken an antidepressant, Cipramil, approximately three years before for a period of two months: p 11. 
52As to the level of alcohol consumption, apparently reported in the present tense by Dr Potter, it was substantially in excess of that referred to in the newly obtained report, which pre-dated the accident by some two years.  Further, as the submission accepted, the new material did little more than ""confirm"" the diagnoses of depression and borderline personality disorder in 2006.  There was nothing in the reasons of the assessor to suggest that those diagnoses were not understood.  The assessor did not find that the claimant suffered from borderline personality disorder.  
53Most of these matters were referred to by the proper officer in her reasons.  Thus, she expressly referred to the discussion by Dr Potter of the claimant's prior psychological history.  Although that passage included a reference to ""a struggle in life and relationships"" it did not specifically refer to (and Dr Potter appears not to have known of) an aspect of her relationship with her fiancé recorded in the new material.  On the other hand, that detail could properly have been put to one side as of limited significance.  It pre-dated the accident by almost 10 months and seven subsequent consultations at the same health care service did not refer to it.  The relationship was continuing at the time of the accident.
54It is true that the proper officer did not refer to the additional material relating to ""excess alcohol consumption in 2006"", but she stated that she had read the submissions and it might be thought that this particular issue was judged not to be of major significance.  It was no doubt relevant information, but it could readily be set aside as not capable of supporting a material change in the conclusion reached by the assessor.
55Further, it is by no means clear that the proper officer dealt separately with the questions whether the information was ""additional"" to that before the assessor, and whether it was capable of having a material effect.  She expressly identified that the medical records in question were ""not available"" to the assessor, but distinguished the information contained in them, which she considered had already been considered.  She did not say there was no additional information, except in the final sentence stating that she was not satisfied ""that the above information is additional and relevant or such as to be capable of having a material effect on the outcome of the previous assessment"".  QBE's submission in this regard turned on the use of the emphasised word ""or"" in this passage, to demonstrate that the proper officer in fact took a two-stage approach.  Even so, it would involve a mind-set determined to find error to read that passage so that the capacity for material effect was not an assessment of the ""above information"" as stated, but only of that information which was additional and relevant, which was none of it.
56QBE accepted that each of the characteristics of information as ""additional"", ""relevant"" and ""capable of having a material effect"" had to be satisfied: on the basis that relevance was not in issue, the proper officer found that the first and third characteristics were not satisfied.  It is sufficient for present purposes to uphold the assessment of the primary judge that the latter finding could not be described as manifestly unreasonable or irrational and did not otherwise demonstrate error of law.  
57For these reasons, there should be a grant of leave to appeal, but the appeal should be dismissed with costs.
58WARD JA:  I agree with Basten JA.
59YOUNG AJA:  I agree with Basten JA.

2421281,"HUGHES, Jenna Lee v R [2014] NSWCCA 15","Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Simpson J and Hall J.

2SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Hall J. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes. I prefer to state, as briefly as possible, my own reasons for reaching that result.

3The applicant entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court to four counts. In order of commission, the offences were:

(i) an offence of misconduct in public office, committed between 31 August 2009 and 23 June 2011;

(ii) a second offence of misconduct in public office, committed on 24 April 2010;

(iii) two offences of giving false evidence to the Police Integrity Commission, each committed on 23 June 2011.

4Misconduct in public office is a common law offence, for which no penalty is prescribed by statute. The penalty is ""at large"". Giving false evidence to the Police Integrity Commission (""the PIC"") is an offence against s 107 of the Police Integrity Commission Act 1996 (""the PIC Act""), for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years.

5On 28 March 2013 Marien DCJ sentenced the applicant. In respect of each of the PIC offences, his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months, commencing on 28 March 2013, and expiring on 28 September 2013 (sic), to be served concurrently. (The expiry date should have been 27 September.) In respect to the first count of misconduct in public office, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment for 7 months, commencing on 28 May 2013 and expiring on 27 December 2013. This sentence was therefore accumulated by 2 months on the PIC offence sentences. In respect of the second such count, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of imprisonment of 18 months, commencing on 28 June 2013 (and therefore accumulated by 1 month on the previous sentence) and expiring on 27 December 2014, with a non-parole period of 9 months expiring on 27 March 2014. In accordance with s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") he made an order directing the release of the applicant at the end of the non-parole period. 

6The aggregate sentence was, therefore, of imprisonment for 1 year and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year, expiring on 27 March 2014. In sentencing the applicant as he did, Marien DCJ gave effect to a finding, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, that special circumstances existed justifying departure from the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.

The proceedings in the District Court

7Sentencing proceedings commenced on 22 November 2012. They were protracted. An Agreed Statement of Facts (about which I will say more below) was presented, together with supporting documentation, a Pre-Sentence Report, and a written outline of submissions by the Crown. The applicant gave evidence, as did her father, a friend (Gary Brown) and a psychologist (Ann Maree De Santa Brigida). A considerable volume of medical reports, including psychiatric and psychological reports, was tendered. After hearing evidence and argument Marien DCJ made it plain that he considered that the criminality called for a custodial sentence. However, he adjourned the proceedings to 25 January 2013, to enable the applicant to be assessed for suitability for the imprisonment to be served by way of home detention or an Intensive Correction Order: Sentencing Procedure Act, s 6 and s 7 respectively). She was ultimately assessed as suitable for an Intensive Correction Order. No assessment as to her suitability to serve a sentence in home detention was provided.

8On 25 January 2013, the applicant gave further evidence and was further cross-examined. As a result of the evidence she gave the matter was further adjourned, to 5 March 2013. The purpose of the adjournment was to enable the Crown to adduce further evidence. That will be explained below.

9The applicant was eventually sentenced on 28 March 2013. 

The facts

10The Agreed Statement of Facts was extraordinarily confusing and uninformative. So much was accepted by counsel who represented the Crown at the sentencing hearing (who was not involved in its preparation). Counsel have a responsibility to ensure that relevant material is put, in comprehensible form, before a sentencing judge. That was not done in this case. Both parties bear responsibility for the unsatisfactory way in which the facts were presented. However, from all of the material ultimately presented, the following can be discerned.

11The applicant was at all material times a serving police officer, stationed at Surry Hills. She had held that position since October 2008. As part of her role as police officer, the applicant was permitted to access a police database formally known as Computerised Operational Policing System of the NSW Police Force, commonly known as and hereinafter at times referred to as ""COPS"". She was also entitled to (and, no doubt, on occasions, obliged) to enter information into COPS. The applicant's entitlement to use that access, however, was circumscribed. She was entitled to do so only for reasons legitimately associated with her duties as a police officer. And, not surprisingly, she was only entitled to enter information she genuinely believed to be correct. In order to protect the integrity of the system, any access to COPS is recorded. Each of the misconduct in public office offences was committed by the applicant having unauthorised access to COPS, and, in one instance, making an entry that she knew to be false.

12It appears that the applicant had become personally involved with some criminal figures in the area. At one point, she had a romantic relationship with a man called Jack Sweeney (also known as Jack Moran). Later, she was romantically involved with another man, Neil Cummins. The latter relationship was current as at April 2010, the date of the second offence.

Count 1

13In the very early hours of 31 August 2009 a motor vehicle was stolen from a man delivering newspapers in Darlinghurst. It was later recovered some distance away. Sweeney and another man (Gavin Rogers) admitted to the applicant that they had been involved in the theft. She did not report these admissions to police investigating the theft. At the behest of Rogers and Sweeney, the applicant accessed the COPS database. Her purpose in doing so was to ascertain whether Sweeney and/or Rogers were under suspicion for the motor vehicle theft. Between 21 October 2008 and 23 October 2009 the applicant accessed the database on no fewer than 47 occasions. 25 of the accesses related to the theft of the motor vehicle, 22 to other offences associated with Sweeney and/or Rogers. The applicant conveyed the result of her searches to Sweeney and Rogers. 

14As set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts, the first offence of misconduct in public office had two components:

(i) the applicant's failure to pass on to appropriate police the admissions made to her by Sweeney and Rogers;

(ii) improper access by the applicant to COPS for illegitimate purposes, and the passing on of the information so gained.

Count 2

15The second offence was committed on 24 April 2010. As mentioned above, the applicant was then in a relationship with Cummins. Cummins was believed to be the bodyguard of a notorious Kings Cross identity, John Ibrahim. A brother of Ibrahim had been seriously assaulted. The Ibrahim family believed that a man named John Macris had attempted to murder the brother. Cummins knew the registration number of Macris' motor vehicle. He asked the applicant to use the COPS database to ascertain the residential address of the owner of the vehicle. Between 6.36am and 6.50am the applicant accessed the database for that purpose on seven occasions. It seems that the searches revealed that the registered owner of the vehicle was Alexandros Macris. John Macris and Alexandros Macris are brothers.

16At 6.51am, realising that her access was recorded, and that she needed to establish a legitimate reason for having accessed the database, the applicant entered an intelligence report. She recorded that, while patrolling Oxford Street, Surry Hills, she observed a vehicle (giving the registration number of Macris' vehicle), carrying four male passengers of Middle Eastern appearance, with tattoos on their arms. She recorded that, on her return to the police station, she made checks that revealed the vehicle and its owner (Alexandros Macris) to have ""serious intel for OMCG (Outlaw Motor Cycle Gang) and Firearm offences"". This report was entirely false, and created by the applicant for the purpose of justifying her earlier access.

Counts 3 and 4

17In March 2011 PIC began investigating allegations of misconduct by the applicant. On 23 June 2011, in an answer to a summons, she appeared before PIC and was questioned. The evidence she gave was, in two respects, false. 

18She said that she had had operational reasons for accessing COPS in relation to Sweeney. She gave as the reason that Sweeney had reported that he had lost his keys in a marathon, and she entered that report on COPS. This evidence was false.

19In relation to her access to COPS with respect to Macris, she maintained that she had seen his vehicle in the circumstances that she had described in the (false) entry. 

20Later on the same day, after the luncheon adjournment, the applicant admitted that her evidence was, in two respects, false. It was false to say that she searched COPS with respect to Sweeney because he had reported lost keys. And it was false to say that she had seen the vehicle with Macris' registration number in Oxford Street. She said that she created the false entry after discovering that the vehicle the subject of the inquiry on behalf of Cummins revealed the owner of the vehicle to be Alexandros Macris, in order to ""cover up"" her earlier unauthorised access. She said that after giving the false evidence, she had time to think about having done so, and realised that she ought not to have done so. It is important to observe that the applicant herself volunteered that she had earlier given false evidence. However, the applicant maintained that her initial access to COPS was to ascertain the ownership of the vehicle. She said:

""When I received the registration plate, I looked up the registration plate, realised who it was. I freaked out because of the name, and then I created the intel report.""

This gave rise to a significant issue in the sentencing proceedings, and goes some way to explaining their protracted nature.

21She said that when Cummins asked her to obtain the address of the owner of the car, he did not mention the name ""Macris"", and that, after the search, when the name ""Macris"" came up, she ""freaked out even more because it's Macris"".

22It is clear that the applicant appreciated the significance of ascertaining, on behalf of a person thought to be associated with criminal elements, the address of a person those criminal elements believed to have been involved in an attempted murder.

The evidence in the sentencing proceedings

23The evidence in the sentencing proceedings fell into two categories: that concerning the applicant's personal circumstances, and that concerning the circumstances and detail of the offences. It will be necessary to return to the former; I now propose to consider the evidence concerning the circumstances of the offences.

Evidence concerning the circumstances of the offence

24In her evidence on 22 November the applicant was asked about her search of the database concerning Macris. She adhered to the position she had taken in the PIC inquiry. Her answer was as follows:

""It came about, Neil [Cummins] asked me - he gave me a registration plate and he asked me if I could confirm that the owner of the car lives in Mosman and I said, yeah, I can do that. And I went onto the COPS system, I typed in the rego plate, and once I'd typed it in it started flashing red and it said - I think it was Alexander Macris (sic). And I knew the name and I freaked out because, one, I shouldn't have been doing this anyway let alone looking up Alexander Macris (sic). And so I freaked out, I created a false intel report to cover as to why I looked him up, and then when I spoke to Neil again I actually had a go at him and said, 'How dare you make me look up him. You know he lives in Mosman.' That's all. I never gave an actual address, I just confirmed that he knew he lived in Mosman.""

This evidence was consistent with the explanation she had given in PIC. It was, however, inconsistent with material derived from COPS contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts. That clearly indicated that the first search made by the applicant was of the name ""Macris, Alex"", and not a vehicle registration number. The second search was of the vehicle registration number, as was the seventh. If that were correct, the applicant's evidence, both in PIC and in the District Court, that she ""freaked out"" on learning the identity of the registered owner, could not be true.

25When the matter returned to court in January the following year, counsel for the Crown sought to adduce additional evidence concerning the answer. The issue is of some significance; on the applicant's evidence her misconduct was in seeking access to information about the ownership of identified motor vehicle. She had no suspicion that the inquiry involved a person whose name was known (unfavourably) to police and who was believed, by others, to have been involved in an attempted murder. She had no reason to suspect that the motor vehicle was associated with any criminal or underworld figure. However, if as the Crown contended, her first search was of the name ""Macris"", that answer was not only false, but she could reasonably be expected to have known that she was involving herself in events which may have included serious criminality. Indeed, the Crown put a submission before Marien DCJ that the applicant, in the circumstances, would have foreseen the possibility of some harm coming to Macris. 

26After further discussion the applicant gave further evidence. She maintained that the first entry she had made into the database related to the vehicle registration number, and not to ""Macris"". She described herself as ""adamant"" and ""150 per cent"" certain of that, and said that there was no possibility of lapse of memory. She acknowledged that she was aware that Macris was a person of ""significance"", although she did not know any detail about him. She said, as she had previously, that when the name ""Macris"" came up as the owner of the vehicle, she ""freaked out"" and said that this was because:

""... when you look up someone of significance it flashes red, which means that they are a major person of interest ... because when it flashes red you shouldn't be looking them up. Just like you shouldn't look John Ibrahim up because he flashes red, unless you have a really good reason to look him up.""

Under cross-examination, the applicant maintained this position.

27There is no doubt that the issue was a significant one in the assessment of the objective gravity of this offence. It was for that reason that the matter was further adjourned in order for the Crown to clarify the factual issue. On 5 March 2013 a statement by Sergeant Herbert Hobbs was tendered, and Sergeant Hobbs gave evidence at length. Sergeant Hobbs was attached to the COPS database management section. His evidence can be relatively shortly stated. It was to the effect that the entry first recorded in the Agreed Statement of Facts represented the first search by the applicant. That was now significant for two reasons: first, because (as the applicant explicitly recognised) accessing information concerning a significant crime figure was more serious than accessing information about the registered owner of a motor vehicle; second, because it would, or could, indicate that the applicant had been untruthful in her evidence, both in the PIC (even after her admission of having given false evidence) and in the District Court. 

Evidence concerning the applicant's personal circumstances

28The evidence concerning the applicant's personal circumstances was extensive. She was born in March 1988 and was 21 years of age at the time she commenced her offending. She was admitted into the Police Force in October 2008 at the age of 20. Entering the Police Force had been a long-held ambition of hers, as is, perhaps, evident from the circumstances in which she gained admission. She gave evidence of her psychiatric history.

29A treating psychiatrist, Dr Richa Ristogi, reported:

""[The applicant] reports onset of her problems since 2009 whilst working as a police officer. During her tenure as a police officer she stated that she had witnessed multiple stressful events some of which had been life threatening causing significant stress. This was emotionally impacting her and there had been personal losses and witnessing other negative incidents. Of particular she described of being present in an incident in October 2009 where her friend and colleague was severely injured in Motor vehicle accident ...

Furthermore she was involved in a Motor vehicle accident in February 2010 ... she described recurrence of flashbacks, nightmares triggered from past memories in 1997 when she found her friend dead and this caused sleep disturbances. This was compounded by witnessing a deceased male who appear (sic) to be shot through his head in March 2010, he had not in fact been shot but had been stabbed and mutilated. Post this event she describes a period of extreme nausea and daily sickness in her abdomen which persisted for weeks. This culmination of series of events in the background of her own past vulnerabilities and current job requiring to face traumatic situations took a toll and being sleep deprived she resorted to self medicating with a variety of analgesic preparations ...""

This history would suggest that the applicant's psychiatric and psychological problems were of recent onset, and associated with her employment.

30However, later in the report, under the heading ""Past psychiatric history"", Dr Ristogi said:

""[The applicant] has a significant past psychiatric history which is a predisposing factor for relapse and contribution to her present condition. She first was diagnosed with depressive disorder at the age of 14 years and had contact with a Child Psychiatrist at Sutherland Hospital. She was treated with an anti-depressant Zoloft for 18 months as well as supportive counselling for a period of 3 years. Her symptoms included an episode of deliberate self-harm and impulsive overdose of medications. The triggers at the time were relationship stressors and compounded by witnessing the death of a friend in 1997 who had been shot through his head.""

31The evidence established that the applicant has long suffered from a variety of psychological or psychiatric conditions. From 2002 to 2006 she had undergone counselling for major clinical depression and anxiety disorder characterised by suicidal ideation and self harm behaviour. According to her general practitioner, over 4 years from 2008 to 2012, she had presented with symptoms of chronic anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder and panic disorder.

32Dr Ristogi addressed the subject of the risk of re-offending, and considered that the applicant was less likely to re-offend based on her then current clinical condition. 

33Ms Brigida took a history similar to that of Dr Ristogi and had a similar opinion. Importantly, Ms Brigida said:

""It is the assertion of this author that at the time of the offences, [the applicant] was greatly affected by the presence of complex PTSD and that the presence of this disorder has resulted in the poor self image and a fragile self concept. Her behaviour at the time of the offences was also affected by her lack of boundaries in relationships which is attributable to her Complex PTSD and her overwhelming need to feel acceptance by others.""

34In fact, the applicant's initial application for entry to the police academy as a trainee police officer was rejected on psychological grounds. The applicant then obtained a psychiatric report that supported her application, but she said in evidence that she gave untruthful answers to the psychiatrist, withholding from him information about her previous psychiatric conditions. As a result, she was accepted for training as a police officer. 

35Both Dr Ristogi and Ms Brigida recorded a number of traumatic events in the applicant's past. One, for example, occurred when she was nine years of age. She told Ms Brigida that, walking with her dog, she had passed the home of a family friend and looked in the screen door. She saw the friend lying on the floor. Three days later it was discovered that he had been shot through the head ""execution style"". 

36In oral evidence, Ms Brigida said that she thought that the applicant's mental health history had played ""a very big part"" in the commission of the offences.

The remarks on sentence

37His Honour's account of the relevant facts was drawn largely from the Agreed Statement of Facts to which I have already referred, supplemented by reference to the oral and documentary evidence. He paid considerable attention to the applicant's oral evidence.

38In fact, his Honour took a highly unfavourable view of the applicant's credibility. He accepted the evidence of Sergeant Hobbs, that the applicant's first access to the database on 24 April 2010 involved the entry of the name ""Macris"". The consequence of that acceptance was that he did not accept the applicant's evidence in the sentencing proceedings, and also considered that the evidence she gave in the PIC continued to be false, even after her apparent confession of falsity. His Honour said:

""On all the evidence before me I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the [applicant] deliberately lied in her evidence before me when she denied that her initial search on the COPS system on 24 April was in relation to the person Alex Macris, and that she deliberately lied when she said that her first access into COPS on that day was in relation to the registration number. Moreover, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt when the [applicant] returned to the hearing room at the [PIC] on the afternoon of 23 June 2011, and purportedly gave a truthful account, she also further deliberately lied before the [PIC] when she stated that she only looked up the registration number.

I am also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that when the [applicant] gave information she obtained from the searches on COPS to Cummins she was aware of the real possibility that the information would be passed on by Cummins to criminal elements and that as a result of her passing on that information to Cummins some physical harm might befall Alex Macris, or a member of the Macris family. The [applicant] agreed in evidence that at the time of the search she knew that there was some link, or suggestion, that John Macris was involved in the shooting of Fadi Ibrahim ... She also agreed that she knew, after conducting the searches on COPS, that Alex Macris was the brother of John Macris.""

There were important findings of fact to which no challenge was made.

39His Honour found that the applicant's awareness of a ""real possibility"" that the information she provided might result in harm to Macris or a member of his family was a significant circumstance of aggravation in relation to count 2. He then held that the fact that the applicant had lied before PIC and before him in the sentencing proceedings indicated that she was not genuinely remorseful for her serious criminal conduct.

40With respect to the mental health issue, his Honour held that the applicant:

""... was acting with deception and planning, attempting to cover up her criminal conduct with false intelligence reports [and that] she was fully aware of the seriousness of the criminality of her conduct."" 

41He accepted the opinions of Ms Brigida and Dr Ristogi that the applicant's mental health history played some part in the commission of the offences, but rejected Ms Brigida's evidence that those factors played ""a very big part"" in the applicant's criminal offending. He accordingly considered that the applicant's mental disorders and history of mental health problems could not be given significant weight in the sentencing exercise. He expressly rejected as unjustifiable a concession by the Crown that the imposition of an Intensive Correction Order would not be an erroneous exercise of sentencing discretion.

42With respect to the objective seriousness of the offences, Marien DCJ properly considered each offence. He said:

""The offences for which the [applicant] is to be sentenced are extremely serious. In relation to the misconduct by public office offences the [applicant] was a serving police officer. The offences involved a gross breach of trust on her behalf. The community is entitled to have confidence in members of the Police Force and is entitled to expect that the confidential information held by police be used only for legitimate police purposes. Considerable weight must be placed on general deterrence when sentencing for such offences.

The offence of knowingly give false evidence at a hearing of the [PIC] carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. Offences of perjury and false swearing undermine the very foundation of the justice system. The need for general deterrence is the prime consideration when sentencing for offences of that kind ... Courts have consistently held that offenders who commit perjury or false swearing in the course of judicial proceedings ... should do so in the clear understanding that if their offence is detected they will receive a fulltime custodial sentence except in exceptional circumstances ...

In my view the objective seriousness of the misconduct of a holder of public office offences falls at the upper range of objective seriousness for offences of that kind. In coming to that view I have taken into account and accepted the opinions of Ms Brigida and Dr Ristogi that the [applicant's] mental health history has played some part in the commission of these offences. However, I am unable to agree with Ms Brigida that the [applicant's] mental health history played 'a very big part' in her criminal offending. The [applicant] was not subjected to any pressure or coercion by any person to commit those offences. She acted freely with full knowledge that her conduct was criminal conduct of a very high order. She did not act impulsively or chaotically when she committed these offences. There was considerable planning by way of her creation of false intelligence reports to cover her tracks. In my view the objective seriousness of the offences, taken together with the need for - in relation to all offences - sentences which place considerable weight on general deterrence require that nothing less than a custodial sentence can be imposed for all offences.""

The grounds of the application

43Three grounds of appeal were notified. They are:

""1 His Honour erred in determining the objective seriousness of each offence (particularly count 4) and, in that regard, placed too much weight on the applicant's evidence given at the sentence hearing.

2. His Honour erred in failing to take into account the likelihood that the applicant would serve her sentence in protective custody.

3. His Honour erred in failing to properly take into account the applicant's mental health issues.""

Ground 1: objective seriousness

44The submissions on behalf of the applicant placed considerable weight on the position adopted by the Crown at sentencing, that a non-custodial sentence, by way of Intensive Correction Order, would not be manifestly inadequate. Quite properly counsel did not suggest that the position adopted on behalf of the Crown in any way bound the sentencing judge.

45What counsel did rely on was what was characterised as a change of approach on the part of the judge. Because he had, as at 22 November 2013, contemplated that an Intensive Correction Order might adequately meet the needs of the case, his departure from that position following the exposure and resolution of the factual issue concerning the applicant's searches on 24 April 2010 indicated that he used the relevant findings of fact to elevate, not only the objective gravity of that offence, but the objective gravity of all offences.

46Reference was then made to the finding with respect to the applicant's credibility, and particularly to her evidence about her first search on 24 April. The submission was made that:

""... the court's finding should have, if anything, only adversely affect[ed] consideration of the applicant's subjective factors such as remorse and contrition ...""

47This submission overlooks the important factual finding made by Marien DCJ, that the applicant was fully aware that disclosure of the information to Cummins might result in harm (and serious harm) to Macris or a member of his family. That is a very significant factor in the evaluation of the objective seriousness of the offence the subject of count 2.

48Counsel then pointed out that, from the beginning, the Agreed Facts had stated that the first entry made by the applicant was a search for the name ""Alex Macris"", and, therefore known to his Honour when he first considered imposing and Intensive Correction Order. His initial consideration of imposing such an Order ought not to have been affected.

49The submission is untenable. Marien DCJ explicitly said that the fact that he requested an assessment was not an indication that a sentence of fulltime custody would not be imposed. Moreover, the applicant's continued adherence to her relatively innocent explanation for her conduct (which he rejected) was properly relevant to the assessment of remorse or contrition, and, accordingly, prospects of rehabilitation.

50In truth, his Honour's findings related significantly to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, given that she did not fully acknowledge the extent of her criminality. That was relevant to all offences. It is true that the applicant will never again be in a position to commit offences of the kind the subject of the present proceedings. However, his Honour was correct to treat the misconduct in public office offences as having a high level of objective seriousness.

51Indeed, in view of those findings, the sentences imposed could be said not to reflect that high level. For objectively serious offences, each sentence is relatively benign.

52It is true that there was a degree of amelioration in relation to the PIC offences, in that the applicant voluntarily disclosed the falsity of her initial evidence: cf Thewlis v R [2008] NSWCCA 176. However, her retraction was only partial. She maintained, and continued in the District Court to maintain, that her first search in the second offence was with respect to the motor vehicle registration number. In the face of the evidence of Sergeant Hobbs, this was simply unsustainable.

53In any event, having regard to the manner in which Marien DCJ structured the sentences, the time served exclusively with respect to the PIC offences was two months. Those are lenient sentences. And the time served exclusively with respect to the first misconduct offence was only one month. That is even more lenient.

Ground 2: protective custody

54This ground can be dealt with shortly. No mention was made during the entire sentencing proceedings of the likely circumstances of the applicant's custody. It was never an issue before Marien DCJ. His Honour could hardly be said to have been in error in failing to take it into account. Indeed, although it is frequently believed that a police officer sentenced to imprisonment will serve a sentence in protective custody, there was no evidence to that effect, and penal policy changes from time to time. There is no basis for accepting fresh evidence with respect to the circumstances of the applicant's custody. I would reject ground 2.

Ground 3: mental health issues

55There is no doubt that the applicant has suffered and continues to suffer significant mental health issues. The authorities in that respect are well known and establish, inter alia, that a causal connection between mental illness and the commission of offences may ameliorate the moral culpability involved in the offence. However, it may also have other consequences: see the discussion by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [177] and [178], and the cases there cited.

56Marien DCJ made clear and careful findings about the applicant's mental health issues, and their relationship to the commission of the offences. Those findings have not been undermined. Again, examination of the sentences actually imposed (and as structured) demonstrates beyond question that every consideration was given to every matter operating in the applicant's favour with respect to sentence.

57For these reasons I agree with Hall J that the applicant should be granted leave to appeal, but the appeal should be dismissed.

58HALL J: The applicant, Jenna Lee Hughes, by Notice of Appeal filed on 2 October 2013, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon her by the District Court of NSW. She was charged with the following offences:

Count 1 - misconduct in public office between 31 August 2009 and 23 June 2011.

Count 2 - misconduct in public office on 24 April 2010.

Count 3 and Count 4 - give false evidence to Police Integrity Commission on 23 June 2011: s 107 of the Police Integrity Commission Act 1996.

59The applicant was sentenced as follows:

Counts 1 and 2: A fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months commencing on 28 March 2013 and expiring on 28 September 2013;

Count 3: A fixed term of imprisonment of 7 months commencing on 28 May 2013 and expiring on 27 December 2013.

Count 4: A term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 9 months commencing on 28 June 2013 and expiring on 27 March 2014, with an additional term of 9 months to expire on 27 December 2014.

60Accordingly, the applicant was sentenced to a total term of 1 year and 9 months imprisonment commencing on 28 March 2013 and to expire on 27 December 2014, with a total non-parole period of 1 year expiring on 27 March 2014.

Factual Matters

61The sentence proceedings commenced on 22 November 2012. The ""Crown Bundle"" was tendered (Exhibit A) which included a document entitled ""Agreed Facts"". The following is a summary of the facts that were agreed between the parties.

Lying to the Police Integrity Commission (PIC): Two Counts

62The facts in relation to Counts 1 and 2 were the subject of evidence given by the applicant on 23 June 2011 when she appeared upon Summons before the PIC. The Agreed Facts contain a more detailed account of the events.

Count 1

63On 20 September 2009, the applicant accessed the Computerised Operational Policing System of the NSW Police Force (COPS) for details of the person Jack Sweeney, also known as Jack Moran, for the purposes of recording an event. Sweeney and the applicant were in a relationship at the time. The applicant created an event on the COPS database. It stated that Sweeney had approached the applicant on Oxford Street to report his keys lost after competing in a marathon. The applicant did not record this in her official police notebook.

The Lie

64The applicant initially stated that she had operational reasons for accessing Sweeney's details on the COPS database because there had been an incident involving him losing his keys and it needed to be reported. She gave evidence to the PIC along those lines. Later the applicant admitted that this had not happened. It is unnecessary here to set out the precise evidence given.

65The lie told by the applicant was that, originally she told the PIC that Sweeney had lost his keys and that that was the reason she accessed information relating to him.

66However, she failed to inform the PIC from the outset that she had concocted the story in an effort to cover-up accessing other information about Sweeney on COPS.

Count 2

67On 24 April 2010, the applicant submitted an intelligence report on COPS. The report stated that she had seen a vehicle (the registration number was provided). Inside it, she claimed that she saw four men of Middle Eastern appearance travelling west on Oxford Street, Surry Hills, in the early hours of the morning.

68Upon her return to the station the applicant completed an intelligence report. She accessed the COPS database and searched the registration number of the vehicle. That vehicle was registered to Alexandros Macris.

69As at 24 April 2010, the applicant was in a relationship with Neil Cummins, a bodyguard of Kings Cross identity John Ibrahim. The Ibrahim family was said to have believed that the Macris family were involved in the attempted murder of Fadi Ibrahim. Cummins had sent a text message to the applicant with the registration number of Macris' vehicle. He requested her to ascertain whom the vehicle was registered to and the registered owner's residential address.

The Lie

70The second lie relates to the applicant's assertion during the PIC hearing that she had seen the vehicle with the registration number in question, consistent with the intelligence report that she filed. In addition, she asserted that the intelligence report had not been a fabrication and that she had legitimately accessed the COPS database for the purpose of searching the vehicle registration by reason of the event that had taken place.

71A number of answers given by her during the hearing revealed the lengths that the applicant went to in order to argue that she had in fact seen the vehicle with the registration number on Oxford Street and had accessed COPS for the purpose of providing an intelligence report in searching the vehicle registration, rather than obtaining Macris' personal details to confirm them with Cummins. The particulars of the evidence given in that respect were set out in the Agreed Facts.

72Following the luncheon adjournment on the day she was giving evidence, the applicant then made admissions. She admitted that she had placed the matter on the COPS system as a ""cover-up"" for looking at the registration details. She additionally said that she did it because Neil Cummins had sent her a text. He said that he wanted the address of the person that owned the car. She said he never mentioned Macris. She then said that when she did the vehicle inquiry it ""lit up"" with the last name ""Macris"". She said she ""freaked out"" because she should not have been doing it. Seeing the name Macris she said ""freaked"" her out even more because of the name. She created the ""Intel Report as a cover-up"".

Misconduct in Public Office: Two Counts

73The PIC was investigating allegations of wrongdoing relating to the applicant. As a result of those investigations, the applicant was charged with two charges of misconduct in public office relating to her improperly accessing the NSW Police Force COPS database and creating false COPS database intelligence reports. Details of matters concerning the charges are as follows: 

(a) Count 1 - Alexandros Macris

74On 24 April 2010, as noted above, the applicant accessed the COPS database. An audit found that she made seven accesses and created one Intelligence Report. The Intelligence Report gave the false account of having seen the vehicle in question on Oxford Street, Surry Hills, with four passengers who appeared to be of Middle Eastern appearance.

75She created the false Intelligence Report in order to mask her inappropriate access and to justify her accessing the details relating to the vehicle in question.

76The inappropriate accessing of the information and subsequent creation of a false Intelligence Report was the subject matter of the Misconduct in Public Office charge. The applicant at the time was a public official who in the course of her duties carried out activities amounting to misconduct having regard to her responsibilities as a police officer.

(b) Count 2 - Jack Sweeney and Gavin Rogers

77On 31 August 2009, a man was delivering newspapers. He parked his vehicle outside the Firestation Newsagency located in Darlinghurst Road, Darlinghurst. As he parked it he noticed two men standing outside the newsagency.

78Whilst he was making his delivery he had left the vehicle running and the keys in the ignition.

79After delivering the newspapers he saw one of the men that had been standing outside was in the vehicle, in the driver's seat, and the other male was attempting to sit in the passenger's seat. 

80Police located the stolen vehicle later that morning.

81After the offence occurred, Gavin Rogers, who was a friend of the applicant and who was an acquaintance of Jack Sweeney (aka Moran), spoke to the applicant about the offence. The applicant told Rogers that she would make inquiries and ascertain if Rogers and Sweeney were suspected of any wrongdoing.

82After having spoken to Rogers, the applicant spoke to Sweeney about what had occurred. She agreed to assist Sweeney find out information about the offence. 

83This offence of misconduct in public office related to:

(a) The applicant's failure to advise police of the admissions made to her by Rogers and Sweeney in respect of their involvement in stealing a vehicle.

(b) Accessing the COPS database to find out information about the car-stealing offence committed by Sweeney and Rogers and then advising them of the result of her accesses.

84A total of 47 accesses of interest relating to either Moran and/or Rogers were identified in the period 21 October 2008 to 23 October 2009. Of these, 25 related to the stealing of the vehicle. The remaining 22 related to Moran and associated events.

85At no stage did the applicant have any operational reasons for her to access the COPS holdings in relation to either Sweeney or Rogers.

86The applicant signed the Statement of Responsibility regarding NSW Police Force Information Systems. She undertook to treat all information coming to her attention as strictly confidential and not to communicate information regarding police business without authority. She further agreed not to access police computer/computer systems for personal use.

87On the facts stated, it is clear that the applicant knew about Sweeney's involvement in the stealing of the car and failed to share this information with police.

88The applicant was aware of the criminal activities of Jack Sweeney and Gavin Rogers, including those activities to which her accesses to COPS in October 2009 related.

The Remarks on Sentence

89In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge at some length specifically referred to the facts concerning Count 4, being the inappropriate accessing of information from the COPS database on 24 April 2010 and the subsequent creation of the false Intelligence Report.

90His Honour noted in his remarks (p 16) that in the applicant's evidence she was adamant that the first entry she made into the COPS system on 24 April 2009 was the registration number of the vehicle.

91However, evidence was called from Sergeant Herbert Hobbs who provided a statement dated 21 January 2013. He was attached to the COPS Data Management Policing Systems, Business and Technology Services as Team Leader.

92Sergeant Hobbs, his Honour noted, gave evidence that the relevant audit report recorded that at 6.36am the applicant made her first access to the COPS system on 24 April 2010 via a program by the name of ""PerFind"" and that the offender entered the name Alex Macris. Further, Sergeant Hobbs said that the audit report revealed that the vehicle in question was displayed after the person ""Alex Macris"" was displayed on the screen and that it displayed the registration number as a direct result of displaying the person ""Alex Macris"".

93The sentencing judge, in respect of the evidence of Sergeant Hobbs, observed:

""... based on his unchallenged evidence I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender's first search on the COPS system on 24 April 2010 was in relation to the person Alex Macris, and not in relation to the registration number, and that as a result of that search, via the Associated Vehicle Option, she searched the details pertaining to vehicle registration number xxx which was owned by a company of which Alex Macris was a director."" Remarks on Sentence at p 19.

94His Honour further observed that it was impossible to conclude that when the offender gave her evidence before him, to the effect that her first access to the COPS system related to the registration number of the vehicle, that she had been honestly mistaken about such matters.

95The sentencing judge further observed:

""On all the evidence before me I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender deliberately lied in her evidence before me when she denied that her initial search on the COPS system on 24 April was in relation to the person Alex Macris and that she deliberately lied when she said that her first access into COPS on that day was in relation to the registration number. Moreover, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that when the offender returned to the hearing room at the Commission on the afternoon of 23 June 2011 and purportedly gave a truthful account, she also further deliberately lied before the Commission when she stated she only looked up the registration number"": Remarks on Sentence at p 21.

96The sentencing judge proceeded then to make a significant finding in the following terms:

""I am also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that when the offender gave information she obtained from the searches on COPS to Cummins she was aware of the real possibility that the information would be passed on by Cummins to criminal elements and that as a result of her passing on that information to Cummins some physical harm might befall Alex Macris, or a member of the Macris family. The offender agreed in evidence that at the time of the search she knew that there was some link, or suggestion, that John Macris was involved in the shooting of Fadi Ibrahim. As I said previously her then partner, Neil Cummins, was a bodyguard of John Ibrahim. She also agreed that she knew, after conducting the searches on COPS, that Alex Macris was the brother of John Macris"": Remarks on Sentence at pp 21-22.

97The sentencing judge stated that the fact that the applicant had been aware of the real possibility that the information provided to Cummins would be passed on to criminal elements, and that some physical harm might befall Alex Macris or a member of his family as a result of the information being passed to Cummins was ""... a significant circumstance of aggravation of the charge of misconduct by a public officer on 24 April 2010 ..."": Remarks on Sentence at p 22.

98The sentencing judge further observed that the fact that the applicant had lied before the Commission and lied before him in the sentencing proceedings, ""... must result in a finding by me that the offender is not genuinely remorseful for her serious criminal conduct"": Remarks on Sentence at p 22.

99The sentencing judge proceeded to consider the applicant's subjective case. He accepted that she did suffer significant mental health issues, having earlier referred to the evidence called in the proceedings from Dr Rastogi, Consultant Psychiatrist, and from a psychologist, Ms De Santa Brigida. 

Reports

100In the report of Dr Rastogi tendered in evidence dated 21 July 2012, Dr Rastogi stated, inter alia:

""... [the applicant] has multiple vulnerability factors mainly early exposure to trauma, unstable attachments and recurring environmental stressors causing a relapse of PTSD and maintained by exposure to ongoing traumatic events. The chronicity of this disorder with co-morbidities such as drug and alcohol problems and generalised anxiety disorder and panic attacks have impacted her insight and judgment in many domains in her functioning and resulted in unstable relationships. It has also impacted her formation of identity and self-esteem. The lack of normal affective regulation resulted in poor impulse control as demonstrate by her actions during her working tenure as well as her drug and alcohol use.

The presence of chronic recurring PTSD with repeated trauma exposure has been a persistent theme of her illness and still continues to interfere with functioning ..."" (at p 4).

Grounds of Appeal

101The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon the following grounds:

Ground 1: His Honour erred in determining the objective seriousness of each offence (particularly count 4) and, in that regard, placed too much weight on the applicant's evidence given at the sentence hearing.

102In the written submissions for the applicant it was stated that the applicant did not challenge the proposition that a custodial sentence was ordinarily appropriate but sought that it be served by way of a home detention order or by way of an Intensive Correction Order given the applicant's mental health issues. It was observed that the Crown did not suggest that either option was unavailable to the court.

103It was further observed that, following adjournment of the proceedings to permit an assessment report to be obtained about both home detention and an Intensive Correction Order, the matter was re-listed on 26 November 2012. On that occasion it was advised that an assessment as sought could not be ordered. His Honour then indicated that he would request an assessment for an Intensive Correction Order only.

104On 25 January 2013, the sentencing judge provided a copy of the assessment report to the parties which assessed the applicant as suitable for an Intensive Correction Order. His Honour then noted that: ""nothing other than a custodial sentence is appropriate given the objective seriousness of all of the offences"" but that the question was whether it was appropriate to deal with the matter by way of an Intensive Correction Order.

105No argument was presented by the Crown opposing an Intensive Correction Order.

106In the written submissions for the applicant it was contended that the sentencing judge erroneously elevated the objective seriousness of each of the offences following the applicant's evidence and that this was related to his Honour's findings, adverse to the applicant, in relation to Count 4 to which reference has been made above.

107I do not consider that there is any substance to this ground of appeal.

108As the Crown correctly observed, a sentencing court is not bound to accept that the assessment of suitability contained in an assessment report in relation to the making of an Intensive Correction Order. His Honour explained his decision to impose a full-time custodial order when he said:

""... Mr Peluso submitted that it would be an appropriate exercise of my sentencing discretion to impose a custodial sentence to be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order rather than full-time custody. However, I am unable to agree with that submission. In my view, taking into account the objective seriousness of these offences and the need for general deterrence the only appropriate sentence is full-time custody. I have come to that conclusion, taking into account the subjective case of the offender including her lengthy history of mental health problems."" (Remarks on Sentence at p 25)

109Whilst the applicant, as the Crown noted, appeared to rely on the submission by the Crown representative at the sentencing hearing that an Intensive Correction Order would not be appellably lenient, a sentencing judge is not bound by any concession made by the Crown in that respect. The reason, of course, is that a sentencing judge retains an overriding obligation to impose a sentence that properly reflects the criminality, taking into account subjective circumstances: R v Paris [2001] NSWCCA 83 at [28]. In that case, Simpson J, with whom Ipp AJA and Wood CJ at CL agreed, observed:

""As I have said, I infer that nothing specific was said by the Crown about alternative penalties and the matter was left to his Honour. Had it been the Crown's position that his Honour should at least have considered alternative penalties, in my view it would have been preferable that that was expressly drawn to his Honour's attention. Of course, a sentencing Judge is not bound by any concession made by the Crown. He or she retains an overriding obligation to impose a sentence that properly reflects the criminality, taking into account subjective circumstances. Nor is this court bound by such a concession but where a party, whether Crown or offender, in a criminal case makes a concession that is accepted by a judge, it is difficult for the subsequent representative of that party to resile from that concession on appeal. The Crown does not here attempt to take that course, acknowledging that it ought not now argue for a sentence of full-time custody. It does not accept that it is precluded from arguing for a lesser custodial penalty.""

110The sentencing judge made it plain that his assessment of the seriousness of the offence overall did not accord with the Crown's submission as to an Intensive Correction Order. His Honour stated:

""I should record that the Crown did not submit that full-time custodial sentences should be imposed. The Crown submitted that the imposition of Intensive Correction Orders would not be an erroneous exercise of my sentencing discretion. I find that concession by the Crown to be wholly unjustifiable in all the circumstances of this case."" (Remarks on Sentence at pp 25-26)

111I do not consider there is any substance to the submission made on behalf of the applicant that his Honour increased the objective seriousness of each of the offences by reason of the seriousness of the offending involved in Count 4. His Honour clearly gave careful consideration to the relevant objective and subjective circumstances of the offending in respect of each count.

112The Crown observed, at [36] of its written submissions, that the sentencing judge's finding that the offences fell at the upper range of objective seriousness was confined to the misconduct in public office offences. He did not make any particular finding of objective seriousness in relation to the knowingly giving false evidence offences. 

113I accept the Crown's further submission that the sentence imposed in relation to Count 3 did not reflect his Honour's findings in respect of the misconduct in public office offences. The sentence imposed in respect of Count 3 was a fixed term of 7 months' imprisonment and the effective penalty for the offending was only 1 month imprisonment as the sentence in relation to Count 4 was to commence one month after the commencement of the sentence in relation to Count 3.

114The sentencing judge was entitled to make a finding that the applicant had not been truthful in the sentencing proceedings and that that supported the finding that she was not genuinely remorseful for the serious criminal conduct by her. Ground 1, in my opinion, has not been established and it should be dismissed.

Ground 2 - His Honour erred in failing to take into account the likelihood that the applicant would serve her sentence in protective custody

115I do not consider that there is any sound basis for this ground of appeal.

116The submissions in support of it were brief. It was observed in the written submissions for the applicant that the issue of serving a custodial sentence in New South Wales in protective custody was not considered by his Honour. The submission was that this was a particularly significant factor given the applicant's former occupation and constituted an error of law. Notice was given that fresh evidence would be sought to be adduced regarding the conditions of her custody.

117As the Crown observed, there was no evidence led from the applicant during the sentence hearing about the likely custodial circumstances to which she would be subjected. No submissions were made on her behalf in that regard. Those factors explain why his Honour did not refer to the issue in his remarks.

118Protective custody, if to be taken into account in mitigation, is required to be supported by evidence of the likely conditions of imprisonment and that they will be more onerous: RWB v R (2010) 202 A Crim R 209 at [192]-[195]; R v LP [2010] NSWCCA 154 at [21].

119According to the Crown's submissions, inquiries have established that the applicant is serving her sentence as a Specialist Management Area Placement (SMAP) at a correction centre and that such inmates are at the lower level of protection available to inmates, a matter referred to in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [179].

120I do not consider that in the circumstances there is a basis for the grant of leave to adduce fresh evidence and that, accordingly, leave to do so should be refused.

121I do not consider that any error has been established as asserted in relation to Ground 2.

122Accordingly, Ground 2 should be dismissed.

Ground 3 - His Honour erred in failing to properly take into account the applicant's mental health issues

123There was a substantial body of material on the applicant's mental health issues before the sentencing judge, both by way of oral evidence and evidence in report form as noted above. His Honour considered and expressly referred to the extensive psychiatric evidence in his Remarks on Sentence at pp 13-15.

124I have earlier set out certain of the evidence provided by Dr Rastogi in his report. I do not consider that the evidence of the psychiatrist as such warrants any qualification. His Honour extended some leniency in sentencing the applicant having regard to the fact, as his Honour noted, that the applicant had, for some time, and did at the relevant time, suffer from significant mental health issues. His Honour also accepted, ""... to a certain extent those mental health issues contributed to the commission of these offences"": Remarks on Sentence at p 22.

125In the written submissions for the applicant the diagnoses of both Dr Rastogi and Ms Brigida were referred to: at [39] and [40]. In addition, reliance was placed upon the Probation and Parole Service pre-sentence report dated 24 July 2012 (Exhibit C). The latter report referred to the applicant's complicated developmental history and unresolved psychological issues and maladaptive coping behaviour which contributed to her offending. An important factor in the present case however is, as the sentencing judge determined, that the applicant had full knowledge and appreciation of what she was doing and that what she was doing in relation to each of the offences was wrong. In this respect, the sentencing judge made a finding in the following terms:

""[d]espite her mental health problems [the applicant] was acting with deception and planning, attempting to cover up her criminal conduct and false intelligence reports. I am satisfied that as a serving police officer she was fully aware of the seriousness of the criminality of her conduct."" (Remarks on Sentence at p 23)

126His Honour referred to the decision in R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 and then stated that, particularly in relation to the misconduct in public office offences, the applicant acted with full knowledge of what she was doing and with full knowledge of the gravity of her actions. His Honour further stated that he was satisfied that when the applicant committed those offences she had a full understanding of the authority and requirements of the law. Accordingly, those matters, his Honour noted, affected the extent to which the mental health disorders and the history of mental health problems could be given weight in the sentencing exercise.

127His Honour further noted that general deterrence was a factor that he had to give effect to in sentencing for the offences. His Honour, as noted above, found that the misconduct in public office offences fell within the ""upper range"" of objective seriousness. It is plain that his Honour in making such findings was well aware of the evidence of Dr Rastogi and Ms Brigida. Indeed, his Honour made a finding of special circumstances by reason of the applicant's mental health history and her need for continuing treatment as well as the fact that her time in custody would be more burdensome than for other offenders without such a history of health issues.

128Contrary to the submissions on behalf of the applicant, I do not consider that the sentencing judge erred in any way by understating the causal effect or impact of the applicant's mental health issues in the commission of the offences. I do not consider there is any substance to the submission made on the applicant's behalf that his Honour erred in placing significant weight on the issue of general deterrence.

129It need hardly be emphasised that police officers are subject to important responsibilities having regard in particular to the position of trust that they occupy. In addition, the importance of maintaining confidentiality of police information is paramount in the effective pursuit of investigative activities and thus the restrictions upon unauthorised persons having access to information including the database information relevant to the present case.

130Accordingly, I have concluded that there is no substance to Ground 3 and it should be dismissed.

131On the basis of the conclusions I have expressed, and for the reasons given, I am of the opinion that leave to appeal should be granted, but the appeal should be dismissed.

		03 March 2014",2014-02-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2421380,R v Abdallah (No. 6) [2014] NSWSC 293,"EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT

1Mr Tarek Abdallah, the accused, is standing trial on an indictment containing two counts. 

2The first count alleges that on 4 January 2012 he murdered Neal Todorovski by shooting him in Selmon Street, Sans Souci. 

3The second count is a count of attempted murder of John Leger. The Crown case is that having shot down Todorovski he pursued Leger, one of Todorovski's associates, and fired his gun at Leger with the intention of murdering Leger.

4The second count is based on s 29 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). So far as is relevant to the present circumstances that provision is in the following terms: 

Whosoever:

Shoots at...


any person,


with intent in any such case to commit murder, shall, whether any bodily injury is effected or not, be liable to imprisonment for 25 years.

5The Crown case can be fleshed out a little more than I have in my introductory remarks. The pursuit of Leger took Leger and the accused down the driveway of an apartment block at number XXXXXX Street, Sans Souci. At the northern end of the driveway Leger climbed over the Colorbond fence and ran east across the backyard of number YY-YY Selmon Street. Whilst he was doing so the Crown says that the accused got to the Colorbond fence, leaned over the fence and shot at Leger as he was still visible crossing the yard. The accused missed, the bullet ricocheted off the ground, passed through a Colorbond fence on the other side of the yard, and struck a Holden station wagon parked on the driveway on the otherside.

6Leger escaped by exiting through a gate at the north-eastern corner of the yard.

7The evidence in the case now being virtually complete with the exception of playing a recording, the contents of which are irrelevant to this charge, learned Senior Counsel for the accused, Mr Dalton, applies for a verdict by direction on the second count.

8It is not necessary for me for the purpose of this application to discuss at length the many precedents concerning the nature of the task of the trial judge in such an application. That legal test may be stated simply by saying if there is any evidence at all, taking all of the evidence led in the case at its highest, and considering all available inferences that might be drawn in favour of the prosecution's case, capable of legally supporting a verdict of guilty the case must be left to the jury for its decision. 

9No question arises about the relative strength of the Crown case, or about whether, as a matter of fact, even if there is evidence legally to support the charge, a verdict of guilty would be justifiable on a conviction appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. My task has nothing to do with that.

10The argument of Mr Dalton may be summarised in this way. He says that there is simply no evidence that the accused shot at Mr Leger. He accepts that there is no doubt evidence, and indeed the accused himself says as much in his evidence, that the accused pursued Leger down the driveway. It is also accepted that there is evidence, including the evidence of the accused, that when he got to the northern end of the driveway he leaned over the fence and discharged his handgun. The point is, on learned senior counsel's argument, that there is no evidence that at the time the accused discharged the gun he was shooting at Mr Leger in the sense of attempting to hit him with a bullet to cause his death.

11The accused's own version is that by the time he leaned over the fence and fired, Leger had already made good his escape through the gate at the north-eastern corner of the yard but that he discharged the gun anyway in the direction of the ground for the purpose of ""warning- Leger-off"", I infer to discourage him from returning until the accused had had the opportunity of making good his escape. The accused says, effectively, that shot was fired in self-defence because Leger was the person who initiated the affray (and I use that expression in a non-technical sense) which resulted in Todorovski being shot.

12Regardless of what the jury, if they come to decide this case, may think of that evidence and the defence of self-defence, as I have said the only question for me is whether there is evidence from which the jury could infer that at the time the accused discharged the gun over the Colorbond fence Leger was still in the backyard, or at least still visible to the accused so as to provide him with some sort of target, and that the gun was fired to hit him.

13The learned Crown Prosecutor acknowledges that his case on the second count is very largely circumstantial. Despite a number of witnesses who have given direct evidence relevant to parts of the second count, that is to say evidence relevant to different elements of the second count, there is no one eyewitness who gives evidence that puts Leger in the backyard at the time the accused fired his gun and to that extent his case must depend upon him persuading the jury to draw an inference favourable to the prosecution.

14The eye-witnesses include a Mrs Kiel. Mrs Kiel lived on the southern side of Selmon Street directly opposite the driveway of number XXXX. She heard events which undoubtedly related to the affray and the discharge of the bullets that killed Todorovski. After taking some steps to safeguard her children who were in the home she slightly opened her front door and looked out. From that vantage point she saw the right side of a person. It is not in issue that that person is the accused. She said at 736.35T:

His left hand was resting on the fence. He was standing in the garden and his right arm was resting over the top of the fence so the top of the fence was underneath his armpit. I didn't see his arms.

Q. What did he appear to be doing?

A. I don't know. He was shouting at some point. I didn't hear what they were saying. I didn't see, like facial expressions, but he was obviously yelling. 

Q. I'm not going to ask you to interpret what he was doing. I'm asking you to tell us what you saw him doing. You told us how he was positioned over the Colorbond fence. What was his activity at that time? 

A. I heard some loud bangs, and at that same point I saw his right hand raise up and then saw the gun in his hand.""

15In cross-examination Mrs Kiel acknowledged that she assumed that the accused was shooting at someone but she did not see whom. She didn't know if he was shooting at the ground or at somebody or at some thing. (748.25T).

16Mr Bain also gave evidence. He was a resident of an apartment in a block on Park Road which is the parallel road directly to the north of Selmon Street. He had been sleeping and he was awoken by someone yelling out, ""You're f** dead."" He looked out his window having been roused from his slumber and saw a person who it is open for the jury to infer was Mr Leger. He did not see any other person and, indeed, on his evidence Mr Leger, it might be said, seemed to be a little disorientated going to and fro looking for a means of exiting the yard. 

17In fact, on Mr Bain's account, the black Range Rover, which is the vehicle of the accused, drove up Campbell Street, which intersects Selmon Street, in a north-south direction, that is, drove north up Campbell Street whilst Mr Leger was still in the yard. His evidence on its own could not make good the necessary element that the accused shot at Mr Leger. And, indeed, there is much to be said for the argument of Mr Dalton that Mr Bain's evidence, taken as a whole, is rather against the Crown case on the second count. Indeed, Mr Bain disavowed having heard any sound which he recognised as a gunshot. He heard a number of bangs which sounded like someone striking an aluminium fence and he agreed in cross-examination that it might have been the sound of someone clambering over a fence. 

18Ms Shumsky falls into a similar category to Mr Bain in the sense that her evidence is more important for what she hears than what she sees. As at 4 January 2012 she also lived in a block of units on Park Road. Mr Bain's block was on the corner of Campbell and Park and Ms Shumsky was in the neighbouring block to the west of Mr Bain's block. What she heard, and she is quite clear about this, is someone screaming, ""You're f****** dead, you're f****** dead."" At T768.35 she gave the following evidence:

Q. Did you hear any other noises aside from the voice at that time? What is it you heard?

A. I don't know if it was a gunshot but it was a loud noise. Like a car backfiring, you know. Like a gun going off. I never heard a gun go off besides on TV. I heard a noise.

19Her evidence is significant in as much as she has the aggressive language immediately followed by a loud noise. From her own experience she could not identify that noise as a gunshot, but it is open to the jury to infer from her evidence that what she heard was the shot fired by the accused over the Colorbond fence. 

20I should also state by way of context that the accused acknowledges that, ""You're f****** dead,"" was a phrase used that day not long before he discharged the gun in as much as he says Leger yelled that at him. Neither Mr Bain nor Ms Shumsky can identify the voice and Mrs Kiel did not hear what was said by anybody except that she did see the accused making facial movements which she interpreted, with her experience of life, as the accused in the act of yelling something.

21There is no single test which establishes the necessary measure of evidence to justify a jury in arriving at a verdict of guilty in a circumstantial evidence case. All that can be said is that it is their obligation to act upon the inferences drawn from all of the circumstances of the case as found by them on the evidence they accept. If applying that test they are of the view that there is a reasonable hypothesis open on all of the circumstances drawn from that acceptable evidence consistent with the innocence of the accused they are bound to acquit. However, my task, as I have said, is different. 

22 I accept the argument of the Crown that in considering the evidence in the case the jury will be entitled to look at all of the evidence that has been led. That will include the evidence about what happened on 12 December 2011 and whether it was the accused on that occasion who uttered a very similar phrase to that heard by Ms Shumsky or whether it was Todorovski who used those words, and in that regard there is a conflict in the evidence between two equally independent eye-witnesses.

23I think also, although care has to be applied, the jury is entitled to approach each case on the whole of the evidence. Each count must be considered separately. However, in deliberating on each count the jury is entitled to consider the whole of the evidence actually led in this trial, and although the murder charge is concerned with what happened on Selmon Street and the attempted murder charge is concerned with what happened along the driveway of XX Selmon Street, it would be artificial to treat these events as isolated from each other. The jury would be entitled to treat them as all the part of a continuum which commenced when the accused arrived in Selmon Street and ended when he departed. And if, for instance, the jury formed the view contrary to the evidence of the accused that in shooting Mr Todorovski the accused was an aggressor, not acting in self-defence, then they may use that circumstance as one of the circumstances established by the evidence in conjunction with all other circumstances to conclude that it was the accused who yelled, ""You're f****** dead,"" down the driveway and discharged his gun at Leger. All of these circumstances, it seems to me, although there is no direct evidence that Leger was a target to be shot at when the accused discharged his gun over the fence, persuade me as a matter of law, not of fact, that there is evidence which would entitle the jury to bring in a verdict of guilty on the second count. Perhaps to express that more felicitously, in my opinion there is legally sufficient evidence to support a verdict of guilty on the second count and I reject the application for a verdict by direction.

2421516,R v Hassan [2014] NSWSC 280,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1On 17 April 2012, Yassir Ibrahim Hassan killed his wife, Mariam Henery Yousif, at their home in Wylie Park, New South Wales.
2He did so by stabbing her on a large number of occasions in a violent attack to her body.  The stab wounds penetrated a number of Ms Yousif's principal organs and blood vessels including her heart, both her lungs, her kidneys and liver, and her inferior vena cava.  She died almost immediately.
3Mr Hassan was arrested in the late evening of 17 April 2012, and has been in custody ever since.  He was charged with murder.
4On 6 March 2013, Mr Hassan was committed by the Local Court at Burwood to the Supreme Court for trial on a charge of murder.  On 5 April 2013, when arraigned in the Supreme Court, Mr Hassan pleaded not guilty.  On 18 November 2013, when arraigned in front of the jury, Mr Hassan pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder, but guilty of the offence of manslaughter.  The Crown declined to accept this plea in full discharge of the indictment.  The trial proceeded.  
5On 6 December 2013, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. 
6It is now time for Mr Hassan to be sentenced for his crime.
7The Crimes Act 1900 provides a maximum term of imprisonment for the offence of manslaughter of 25 years.  There is no standard non-parole period fixed by legislation.
Judicial Task on Sentencing
8In the circumstances of this present case, it is appropriate that I remind myself of the judicial task on sentencing.  That is, how a judge, in each individual case, must go about the task of fixing a sentence which accords with the legislation, the principles of the common law and is appropriate in the particular factual circumstances of this case.
9In the present system of criminal justice, I must exercise a discretion as to what sentence should be imposed upon Mr Hassan by applying well-identified principles of law to the facts which I find: R v MacDonell (NSWCCA, 8 December 1995, unreported) per Hunt CJ at CL at [1]-[2]:
10The principles of law are well established and can be conveniently summarised in the following way:
""1. Where, following a trial by jury, a person has been convicted of a criminal offence, the power and responsibility of determining the punishment to be inflicted upon the offender rests with the judge, and not with the jury...;
2. Subject to certain constraints, it is the duty of the judge to determine the facts relevant to sentencing.  Some of these facts will have emerged in evidence at the trial; others may only emerge in the course of the sentencing proceedings ...;
3. The primary constraint upon the power and duty of decision-making ... is that the view of the facts adopted by the judge for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. This may produce the result that, in a particular case, the view of the facts which the judge is obliged to take is different from the view which the judge would have taken if unconstrained by the verdict ...;
4. A second constraint is that findings of fact made against an offender by a sentencing judge must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt ...;
5. There is no general requirement that a sentencing judge must sentence an offender upon the basis of the view of the facts, consistent with the verdict, which is most favourable to the offender....  However, the practical effect of 4 above, in a given case, may be that, because the judge is required to resolve any reasonable doubt in favour of the accused, then the judge will be obliged, for that reason, to sentence upon a view of the facts which is most favourable to the offender ..."".
R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 377-378; see also Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1.
11Although in an exceptional case, it is open to a judge to make an enquiry of the jury to determine the basis upon which they arrived at a verdict of manslaughter, I did not do so, because this is not such an exceptional case. As well, it is no part of the sentencing function for me to attempt to discern the basis upon which the jury reached their verdict. But rather, in sentencing Mr Hassan, I am obliged to do so, upon findings of fact which I alone make, but with the constraint that those facts must be consistent with the jury's verdict.
12Sentencing is not an exercise of mathematical precision leading to a single correct answer. Rather, having determined the appropriate facts which relate to the offence, the proper approach to sentencing is to identify all of the factors that are relevant to sentencing in this case, identify their significance with the particular circumstances of the offence and then to make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence having regard to the purpose for which a sentence is to be imposed: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [26].
13I will apply these principles in the course of this sentence.
The Relevant Legislation & Common Law principles
14The Parliament of NSW has set out the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender.  Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that those purposes are:
""(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence;
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences;
(c) to protect the community from the offender;
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender;
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions;
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender;
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""
15It is self evident that these purposes overlap, may be in conflict, and cannot be considered in isolation, one from the other in their application to a particular case. These purposes do not rank in any order of priority.
16The terms of s 21A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, mean that the Parliament has preserved the entire body of judicially developed, or common law, sentencing principles: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [56]-[57]: Muldrock at [18].  These common law principles have been developed over time by courts to provide guidance for the exercise of the sentencing discretion by every judge.  The principles are to be found in decided cases. 
17Of particular relevance here, is that any sentence which is imposed should be proportionate to the gravity of the offence: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 472 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ. 
18This is a case where, given the nature of this particular offence, that is, one associated with domestic violence by a man against a woman, the principles of general deterrence and institutional denunciation of the crime involved must play an important, although proportionate role: Regina v Greene [2001] NSWCCA 258 at [16]. General deterrence is a powerful factor in the protection of the public by making it clear that others who may be tempted to engage in similar conduct will meet with severe punishment.
19I will need to bear in mind the legislation by which I am bound and the principles which the Courts have determined, when proceeding on this task of sentencing Mr Hassan.
The Facts
20I find the facts of the matter, which are consistent with the verdict of the jury, to be as follows.
21Mr Hassan was born on 1 January 1958, and was, accordingly, 54 at the time he killed his wife.  Prior to his moving to Australia in 2008, Mr Hassan had spent his whole life in the Sudan.
22His wife, Mariam Yousif, was born in May 1987 and was, accordingly, 24 years old at the time of her death.  Although born in the Sudan, Ms Yousif grew up and was educated in Australia.  
23Mr Hassan and Ms Yousif were married in the Sudan in 2003.  He was then 45 years old and she was 16.  They lived in the Sudan together whilst their first two children were born, and then returned to Australia in 2008.  
24Initially they lived in Melbourne with Ms Yousif's mother.  However, after a few weeks, they moved to Sydney, where they lived with a friend, then at premises in Punchbowl, and ultimately at an apartment which they rented at Wiley Park.  
25After they moved to Sydney, Ms Yousif stayed in close contact with her mother and her younger sister, Cathy.  She would speak to them frequently by telephone, often more than once each day.  
26In January 2010, the youngest child of Mr Hassan and Ms Yousif was born.  The birth took place in Melbourne, where Ms Yousif stayed for about a month.  She returned to Sydney with her newborn baby and her other children, and resumed living with Mr Hassan. 
27It seems that from about that point of time the marital relationship deteriorated.  The cause of that deterioration is not entirely clear.  There were, however, a number of events which no doubt aggravated the relationship.  In the first place, there was a significant age difference between the couple.  Secondly, having been raised in Melbourne, Ms Yousif seemingly had a more relaxed approach to socialising with the broader community. Mr Hassan thought that she should not have such broad interaction. There were cultural differences in their relationship about the appropriate bounds of adult behaviour. Thirdly, Mr Hassan was critical of the way in which his wife was bringing up their children.  He thought that her discipline was too harsh. 
28Fourthly, Mr Hassan on a number of occasions secretly recorded his wife having conversations with her mother and sister on the telephone, and also interacting with their children.  He did this in a furtive and concealed way.  This attempt at covert recording was discovered on more than one occasion by his wife, and she, in no doubt forceful terms, expressed her dissatisfaction to Mr Hassan with this conduct.  He saw nothing wrong with it.  Finally, Mr Hassan did not get along well with Ms Yousif's family and, did not approve of the behaviour of some members of Ms Yousif's family, particularly her brother.
29The marital relationship deteriorated to such an extent that in October 2011, Ms Yousif and her three children left their apartment in Sydney and moved to Melbourne.  She told her mother and sister that her husband, Mr Hassan, had, in accordance with Muslim law, divorced her.  Mr Hassan accepts that this is what happened.
30Ms Yousif lodged an application for public housing and took steps to enrol her children in school or preschool in Melbourne, in the vicinity of where she was temporarily living with her mother.  This separation lasted a number of weeks, and terminated when Mr Hassan telephoned and informed Ms Yousif that he had ""rescinded"" their divorce because he was not in a rational state of mind when he first divorced her.  At his request, she returned to Sydney with her children and resumed cohabitation with him.  
31On 17 April 2012, Ms Yousif rang her husband at work to discuss with him the fact that she had found a coffee grinder which had been rendered inoperative by the cutting of the electric power cord.  She did not speak to her husband in that phone call, but he returned her call during that day.  They had an argument.  She accused him of cutting the power cord to the grinder.  He denied it and blamed their 7 year old son.  Unsurprisingly, Ms Yousif did not accept that their son would have been able to, nor did he, cut the power cord.  Mr Hassan, who was obviously angry, told Ms Yousif that she should wait until he got home.
32Before coming to find the balance of the relevant facts, I need to make some observations about the account of facts given by Mr Hassan prior to, and during, the trial. Mr Hassan gave evidence at the trial before the jury with the assistance of an interpreter. My comments about his evidence make due allowance for this fact. He did not give any further evidence during the sentencing hearing. 
33I found Mr Hassan to be an unimpressive witness. Frequently, he gave answers which were inconsistent with evidence which he had earlier given, he gave answers which were evasive, and I thought deliberately so, on some occasions, and he displayed a degree of resentment in having to answer questions which challenged any answer or explanation which he had given.  For example, in one account in evidence, he said that on the evening of her death, his wife attempted to commit suicide, and that he sustained his arm injury trying to stop her.  Another account suggested that she attacked him whilst he was asleep and he sustained the injury when he was defending himself and prior to removing the knife from her. These accounts cannot stand together.
34Accordingly, I am not able to accept his evidence simply because he has given his account of what happened. To the extent that objectively, or else independently, established facts contradict his evidence, I have generally accepted those facts. In following this course, I bear in mind that any finding which is adverse to Mr Hassan must be one of which I am persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt.
35There were a number of other phone calls on that day between Ms Yousif and Mr Hassan.  Mr Hassan offered an explanation that they were made to discuss the selling of household items in advance of a proposed move to Perth.  Whilst I accept that there may have been, in the past, some discussions about a possible move to Perth, I am well satisfied that there was no discussion on that day about selling household items in advance of moving to Perth. Had such a discussion taken place, I would have expected Ms Yousif to have told her mother and sister, but she did not do so.
36During the course of this day, Ms Yousif told both her sister, and later her mother, that she and Mr Hassan had argued over the telephone on that day, and Mr Hassan was angry.  I am satisfied that this is in fact what occurred.
37Mr Hassan left his work at about 4.35pm.  He travelled home.  It is unclear at precisely what time he arrived home, but I am satisfied that it was at or about 6pm.  I am also satisfied that Ms Yousif died at about 11pm.  The question of what occurred in the five hours whilst Mr Hassan and Ms Yousif were at home together was a matter of contest in evidence.  
38As Mr Hassan was the only eyewitness to the events during this part of the evening, and I do not accept his various accounts of the events, there is little evidence about what happened, and it is not correct for me to speculate.  One thing which is clear is that whatever transpired that evening was not particularly noisy because the next door neighbour, Mr Eaton, did not hear anything untoward prior to the arrival of the police officers.
39By about 8.30pm, I am satisfied that the children had been put to bed in the front bedroom of the apartment, which was their room.
40During those five hours there were a number of verbal arguments, about a variety of matters, between Ms Yousif and Mr Hassan.  These arguments caused Ms Yousif to be upset and scared of her husband.  She spoke on the telephone with her mother, and her sister.  She was clearly unhappy and distressed.
41At some point during the evening, Ms Yousif changed into her nightwear.  It consisted of a pair of underpants and a long, blue T-shirt which stretched down to about her knees.  She had no other undergarments on.  She went to bed.  She covered herself with a pink and red blanket.  I do not think that she fell asleep.
42I am satisfied that Mr Hassan, having returned home, had a shower and changed into clothes which were street clothes and not of a kind which he would wear to bed.  He was wearing these clothes when arrested later in the evening.
43However, it is clear that at the time when he attacked Ms Yousif, Mr Hassan had lost his self-control to such an extent that he must have formed an intention to kill Ms Yousif.  Such a finding is consistent with the jury's verdict.
44What caused Mr Hassan to lose his self-control is unable to be precisely determined, except that I am persuaded that it must have consisted of words said by his wife to him in the course of one of the verbal exchanges which occurred between them that evening.
45Whilst I cannot be satisfied as to exactly what was said, the most likely account is that which was given by Mr Hassan in his evidence, when he said that his wife said to him words to the effect that he was not a man, the children were not his but were another man's and he should take a look in the mirror, and further that these words were accompanied by swearing on her part.
46Although, as I have said, I generally do not accept his evidence, this explanation which he gave, I do accept.  I do so because it accords with the probabilities of what occurred and it provides the only rational explanation as to the cause of Mr Hassan's loss of control.  
47At about 11pm, after a number of verbal arguments I accept that Ms Yousif said something like the words to which I have just referred to Mr Hassan which caused him to lose his self-control, take up a large knife, and brutally attack his wife.  He stabbed her at least 14 times.  The stab wounds were distributed over the front upper part of Ms Yousif's torso, on the back of her arms and her fingers, on her upper left thigh at the rear, and one large stab wound in her back.  
48The evidence of Dr Van Vuuren, the expert pathologist, satisfies me that of all of the wounds, two of them - one which entered from her back and penetrated to a depth of 150mm, and the other which entered from just under her left breast and penetrated into her heart - were the most likely to have caused the death of Ms Yousif.
49The distribution of the wounds and their number, and in particular, the depth of a number of the wounds, up to 150 mm, delivered through a blanket, persuade me beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Hassan mounted the brutal and vicious assault on the deceased whilst she was on or in the bed and cowering under one of the blankets.  She received defensive wounds to her arms and hands as she attempted to cover her upper body during the assault.  The wounds to her thigh and her back were, I am satisfied, sustained during this assault as she curled up and tried to turn away from her husband while he attacked her.  She no doubt fought back.  That is how she got the wounds to her hands.  
50At some stage, in the course of this frenzied attack, Mr Hassan sustained a laceration to his left upper arm.  The course of the attack forced Ms Yousif off the bed and onto the ground where she bled profusely.  Mr Hassan left the room and left his wife to die.  She did so quite quickly.  
51He then proceeded to wash himself in the bathroom, leaving smears of his wife's blood in the bathroom and on the floor.  He took the knife and concealed it in a cupboard in the children's room.  He woke his children and dressed them.  He called 000 and told the operator that he required the ambulance and police because he had ""trouble with his wife"".
52Accordingly, to summarise, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that against a background of marital disharmony, on the evening in question, one or more arguments took place between Mr Hassan and Ms Yousif.  Those verbal exchanges culminated in Ms Yousif questioning Mr Hassan's manhood and whether he had fathered their children, and she verbally abused him by swearing at him.
53As a consequence of this verbal assault, Mr Hassan lost his self-control to such an extent that he brutally stabbed his wife to death.
54I have concluded that the degree of provocation offered by the verbal arguments and insults was at the lower end of the scale, particularly given the maturity of Mr Hassan as a 54 year old man.  I have also concluded that the loss of self-control occurred very shortly after the verbal arguments and insults.  I have also concluded that the attack was vicious and brutal and was completely excessive when all of the circumstances are considered.
55Mr Hassan falls to be sentenced for the manslaughter of his wife upon the basis of a low level verbal provocation which was shortly thereafter followed by an excessively violent and brutal attack.  
Police Investigation
56The police secured the crime scene at the apartment and, having arrested Mr Hassan, took him to the Campsie Police Station.  
57After he received medical treatment, he participated in an electronically recorded interview commencing at about 4am.  It concluded at about 6.30am.  The interview was conducted with the assistance of an Arabic interpreter.  The transcript of the interview, Exhibit T, contains an accurate record of what Mr Hassan said.  In short, he told the police that his wife had attacked him whilst he was in the bedroom.  He attempted to defend himself and took the knife from the deceased.  He told the police that his wife continued to ""swear at him"" and to call him a number of names.  He said as a result of that, he retaliated but could not recall the details of what it was that he had done to his wife. 
58I am well satisfied that this account of what occurred which suggests that he killed his wife whilst acting in self-defence was incorrect, and Mr Hassan must have known it to be incorrect when he gave the police that version.  The correct sequence of events was as I have earlier recounted.  Mr Hassan was provoked by Ms Yousif immediately before the attack, he was not acting in self-defence.
Specific Statutory Considerations
59Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act identifies a number of matters which the Parliament has provided as aggravating factors to which regard must be had in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed.  As well, there are matters in mitigation to which regard must also be had.  It is appropriate to commence with the aggravating factors.  
60There are a number of matters which may be regarded as aggravating factors within the meaning of the legislation. However, I am satisfied that to the extent that they are applicable, I should not have any additional regard to them, as they are included in the offence and do not merit separate consideration. 
61There are a number of mitigating factors to which I am required to have regard, and to which I do.  They are, first, that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity: s 21A(3)(b).  The offence did not have any degree of planning about it. It was not, I am satisfied, part of any planned or organised criminal activity.  It was more reactive to the situation in which Mr Hassan found himself.  This has a mitigatory effect.
62Secondly, another specified mitigatory matter is whether the offender was provoked by the victim: s 21A(3)(c).   I have found that Mr Hassan was provoked, and hence has been found guilty of manslaughter and not murder.  No further weight ought be attributed to this consideration because it has already been taken into account. Thirdly, it is relevant to note that the offender had no prior criminal convictions and was a person of good character which are matters of mitigation: ss 21A(3)(e) and 21A(3)(f).  Here the Crown accepted that Mr Hassan was, prior to the events of 17 April 2012, a man of prior good character.  I take this mitigating factor into account.
63Next, I am required to have regard to Mr Hassan's prospects of rehabilitation and likelihood of re-offending: s 21A(3)(g) and 21A(3)(h).  In the proceedings on sentence, a report of Ms Delphine Bostock, a psychologist, was tendered.  She expressed the view that, providing he receives appropriate support, the likelihood of Mr Hassan committing further offences in the future is minimal.  I accept this unchallenged opinion;
64It appears from Ms Bostock's report that Mr Hassan has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, largely because he did have any apparent empirically-based criminogenic needs associated with violence, and did not have any prior history of criminal conduct.  I accept that this is so, and proceed on the basis that Mr Hassan has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.
65Finally, where an offender has shown remorse, such demonstration can mitigate any offence: s 21A(3)(i).  Save for his early plea of guilty, I see no evidence of remorse whatsoever in the attitude of Mr Hassan to what has occurred.  On the contrary, the version of events he gave to police, and much of his evidence in this Court, tell against a finding that he is, in any respect, remorseful for what has occurred.  Whilst this does not aggravate any sentence, it simply means that Mr Hassan is not entitled to the benefit of a demonstration of any remorse or contrition. The plea of guilty does not reflect any significant degree of remorse. After all, there could never be any doubt as to who killed Ms Yousif. The plea was a pragmatic offer reflecting the circumstances in which Mr Hassan found himself, rather than a demonstration of any remorse. 
66The totality of the evidence reveals to me a man who feels unable to demonstrate any regret for what he did, and a man who feels wronged by his current predicament.  He regards himself as the victim of what occurred and not a perpetrator. He continues to advance excuses for what occurred, largely about his wife's conduct towards him which he continues to regard as inappropriate, which do not persuade me that he shows any true remorse for what he has done, nor that he readily accepts any moral responsibility for what he has done.
67I will, in imposing a sentence, have regard to all of these matters.  
Plea of Guilty
68When these proceedings were before the Local Court in 2012, and before Mr Hassan was committed for trial, he offered to plead guilty to the offence of manslaughter.  That offer was not accepted by the Crown.  Had the plea been accepted, there would have been a substantial benefit to the administration of justice in New South Wales.
69Mr Hassan is, in accordance with the authorities, entitled to a full discount of 25 per cent on any sentence imposed: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crime R 1.  The Crown expressly conceded that this was the correct approach.  
Mr Hassan's Criminality
70It is appropriate to make an assessment of the objective criminality involved in Mr Hassan's offence.  This is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to Mr Hassan, and is to be assessed wholly by reference to the nature and circumstances of the offence: Muldrock at [27].  
71In my assessment, the criminality was very serious.  Mr Hassan has killed his much younger, much smaller wife in their home by brutally attacking her in a frenzied way as she defended herself, showing her no mercy at all.  But this happened because he was provoked into losing his self-control, which explains why he is guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter and not murder.  
72Manslaughter is an offence which can be constituted by a wide variety of factual circumstances.  However, each circumstance has as a constant that a human life been feloniously taken, which is a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the circumstances of each case.  
73As I have earlier said, I am satisfied that in the circumstances of this case, the provocation was at a low level, and although the loss of self-control was almost immediate, the degree of violence inflicted on Ms Yousif was excessive.  I regard this case as showing why the offence of manslaughter is properly regarded as a major crime, and this case is a most serious example of it.  
Victim Impact Statements
74The Court has heard statements read by or on behalf of each of Ms Yousif's mother, Hanan Zaki, and her sister, Dimyana Gabra.  
75Clearly this crime has touched the members of Ms Yousif's family, and affected them all deeply.  Her three children, the eldest of whom is now about 9 years old, have been left without a mother, and have now moved interstate to be cared for by family members.  They will grow up without ever really knowing their mother, and enjoying her love and affection.
76I will have such regard to this evidence as the law permits: R v Previtera [1997] 94 A Crim R 76; s 28 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
Subjective Circumstances of Mr Hassan
77Mr Hassan is now 56 years old.  He was 54 when he killed his wife.  
78He grew up in the Sudan in what seems to have been a loving family.  He left school at age 14 to work and help support his family.  He worked in the Sudan as an electrical technician.  Although his work occasionally took him to the areas of conflict, he lived away from these areas, and generally stayed away from war zones.  He lived in an area which was relatively safe.  He was good at his work and made friends with some of his customers.
79Before marrying Ms Yousif, he was married to his first wife. They did not have children. Their divorce was amicable.
80Since 2008, when he came to Australia, he commenced employment once he came to Sydney and has largely remained employed ever since. 
81With the exception of the conflict within his marital relationship, and his inability to get along with his wife's family, Mr Hassan seems to have had a relatively normal life, which for present purposes, can properly be regarded as unremarkable.  
82In all respects, prior to the events in question, he was a man of good character.  
83Whilst in custody, he has attempted to improve his English skills.  He has attempted to, unsuccessfully so far, re-establish his relationship with his children.  He has a degree of anxiety and depression which is a reaction to his present circumstances.  
Sentence
84In considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Mr Hassan, I commence with the reminder that manslaughter involves the unlawful taking of a human life.  It is a violation of the sanctity of human life, which is a concept at the heart of a civilised community.  
85Ordinarily, a conviction for manslaughter of the seriousness here found warrants a substantial sentence because the demands of punishment, and the deterrence of the broader community against similar conduct, are of significant importance.  
86I have discussed all of the facts which are relevant to this decision, and it is now necessary to make a value judgment as to what the appropriate sentence is.  
87This is a very serious offence involving the killing of a young, defenceless woman.  The killing was committed by her husband who was much older and more mature.  There is no real explanation for his conduct except that he was provoked.  There is certainly no justification for his viciousness and brutal and cowardly conduct.  
88Without regard to any discount for his plea of guilty, I determine that the appropriate sentence is to be one of a total of 16 years imprisonment.  
89However, that sentence is reduced because of his plea of guilty to a total of 12 years imprisonment.
90It is necessary to determine an appropriate period for Mr Hassan to serve as a non-parole period. This requires attention to be paid to the question of special circumstances.
91I am not satisfied that I should make a finding of special circumstances as the law permits: s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Mr Hassan submitted that special circumstances existed because of his need for rehabilitation upon release back into the community.  That he has such a need cannot be doubted.  However, I do not see in this case that the period provided in the statute would be inadequate for that purpose.  I also accept that this is the first time for Mr Hassan to be imprisoned, and I also accept that his lack of easy facility with the English language will mean that his time in jail will be lonely because there will likely be little access to other prisoners who speak his native tongue fluently, Sudanese Arabic.
92However, I am not satisfied that I should make a finding of special circumstances notwithstanding these matters. Accordingly, the non-parole period ought be 9 years. 
93I am well satisfied that the nature and seriousness of the crime means that any lesser penalty, even having regard to all of the subjective factors which weigh in favour of Mr Hassan, would be adequate to punish him, and to denounce the crime.
Offence of Serious Personal Violence
94I am required to warn Mr Hassan, which I now do, of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006, and the fact that that Act applies to the offence of which he has been convicted, and for which he is being sentenced.  At some future point in time, an application may be made that notwithstanding the completion of his sentence, he nevertheless ought be detained in ongoing custody, or else ought be the subject of an extended supervision order impacting upon his liberty.
Sentence
95Mr Hassan, I sentence you to the following term of imprisonment:
(1)A non-parole period of 9 years commencing on 17 April 2012 and concluding on 16 April 2021;
(2)A balance of term of 3 years expiring on 16 April 2024;
The first day upon which you will be eligible to be released is 16 April 2021.

2421627,Iselin v Resource Pacific Pty Ltd t/as Ravensworth Underground Joint Venture formerly Resource Pacific Limited t/as Newpac No. 1 Colliery [2014] NSWDC 80,"Judgment

1The plaintiff by notice of motion filed on 30 January 2014 seeks orders as follows:

(1)An order, nunc pro tunc, granting leave to continue these proceedings numbered 2013/326338 against the respondent pursuant to s 151D(2) of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW);

(2)Any additional orders as this Honourable Court sees fit;

(3)Costs in the cause.

Factual background

2The plaintiff was a 27-year veteran as a worker in mines. At all relevant times he was employed by the defendant as a coal mining deputy working at Newpac. The statement of claim sets out the plaintiff's work history and circumstances of injuries succinctly as follows:

""4. During the ownership and operation of Newpac by RPL [Resource Pacific Limited] it failed to take steps to adequately drain the mine so as to avoid undue collections of ground water in areas where employees and particularly deputies were required to walk.

5. Upon Glencore Xstrata PLC assuming control and operation of RUM [Ravensworth Underground Mine] it dug trenches in appropriate parts of the mine and filled them with rubble in order to create a drain to collect ground water which was then pumped to the surface.

6. On 2 September 2007 the plaintiff, in the course of his employment with RPL, was walking along a rib edge which was very wet and which consisted of heavy damp sludge. As the plaintiff was endeavouring to make his way through this area of the mine he suffered a twisting injury to his right knee.

7. The plaintiff subsequently was put off work to undergo medical treatment from time to time.

8. On or about 6 November 2007, after having undergone an arthroscopy, the plaintiff returned to work on selective duties above ground as he continued to have problems with his right knee.

9. The plaintiff's right knee deteriorated to the extent that it was necessary for him to undergo a tibial osteotomy with internal fixation on 29 September 2008.

10. The plaintiff was then off work until 28 May 2009 when he was cleared to return to pre-injury duties.

11. By this time Glencore Xstrata PLC was the operator of RUM. It was a requirement of the defendant that the plaintiff demonstrate certain capabilities before being allowed to resume full duties. One of those tests was to access and pass through the second egress tunnel. In the course of carrying out this test the plaintiff suffered a significant twisting injury to his left knee.

12. The plaintiff continued performing his pre-injury duties and his left knee continued to deteriorate necessitating an arthroscopy on his left knee on 11 January 2010. This surgery did not resolve the plaintiff's symptoms with his left knee and accordingly on 29 August 2011 he underwent a left total knee replacement.

13. On 29 May 2013, the plaintiff underwent a total right knee replacement.

14. The plaintiff was medically retired on 7 January 2011 and was formally terminated from his employment with the defendant on 11 November 2011.

14. [sic] At all material times the defendant was under a duty to take all reasonable care to prevent injury to employees in the course of their duties. The defendant breached those duties and thereby occasioned to the plaintiff pain, injury, loss and damage.""

3The plaintiff's affidavit sets out the circumstances of his injury on 2 September 2007 and in the course of cross-examination he described how the first and second accident occurred.

The first accident 

4The plaintiff injured his right knee while walking along the ""rib edge"" of heavy damp sludge during his 2 September 2007 shift. He reported his injury to a Mr G Randall and, although he could not remember the time of the incident during the shift, filled out the rest of the Coal Mines Insurance Employee's Compensation form.

5This form, an annexure to the plaintiff's affidavit, contains his statement that he had suffered previous injury to this part of his body before the accident and that the knee had been ""progressively getting worse"". He described the circumstances of the 2 September 2007 injury as being at South Mains and being as follows:

""HAVE TWISTED THE KNEE SEVERAL TIMES AND HAVE PERSERVERED [sic] WITH IT BUT THIS TIME IT IS VERY PAINFUL""

He added, in the section ""Other Similar Injuries"":

HAVE INJURED KNEE SEVERAL TIMES ON THE SLIPPERY & UNEVEN FLOOR CONDITIONS""

6The plaintiff first saw the doctor referred to in this form (Dr Bajic) three days after the injury. He then underwent extensive treatment, paid for by the workers' compensation insurer. That treatment included a right knee arthroscopy on 2 October 2008, following which he was certified fit for duties on 22 October 2007 by the specialist, Dr Petrelis, and returned to the mine on selective duties. He again sought medical advice on 14 September 2008, and Dr Caldwell performed a right knee tibial osteotomy on 29 September 2008. The plaintiff returned to pre-accident duties on 28 May 2009. 

The second accident

7The plaintiff describes how the second accident occurred in his affidavit sworn 25 March 2014 (Exhibit A):

""5. My right knee deteriorated and required a tibial osteotomy with internal fixation performed by Dr Bruce Caldwell at Toronto Private Hospital on 29 September 2008. When I returned to work subsequent to this surgery performing selective duties in 2009, I was advised that before being permitted to return to my pre-injury duties, I was required to walk the second egress. I recall the then Safety Officer coming to see me to advise of this requirement. I said to her in words to the effect:

""I don't know how I'll handle that. From what I remember of the roads they are very rough and hard to walk on. I'm concerned for my knee.""

She responded: ""Just do it. See if you can do it.""

Whilst performing this test on 12 August 2009, I suffered additional injury to my left knee. I was on my own at the time of performing this test. I doubt that the Safety Officer had ever walked the second egress.""

8The plaintiff described this egress in his evidence as having been several kilometres long, most of it sloping, and culminating in a series of ten or more ladders of about 14 steps each. Despite suffering pain in both knees, the plaintiff continued working underground. He underwent an arthroscopy on 11 January 2010 on his left knee but the problem continued. In his affidavit, he described the circumstances of his continued deterioration as follows:

""6. Despite the injuries to my bilateral knees, I persevered and continued working underground. My injuries progressively deteriorated to the extent that I required total knee replacements on 29 August 2011 with respect to my left knee, and 30 May 2013 with respect to my right knee. Coal Mines Insurance [CMI] paid for both these surgeries and all treatment I have ever required with respect to my right and left knee conditions since 2 September 2007. CMI are continuing to pay for my treatment with respect to my bilateral knee conditions to date.

7. It became apparent to my employer that I was no longer capable of continuing in my role as underground coal mining deputy on 7 January 2011. I recall that day clearly. I turned up for work. I was performing my pre-injury duties at that stage. I was working underground. I attended an Undermanager briefing as usual in the morning. I later instructed my crew as to the day's requirements. Subsequently, I was called to a meeting with the Manger [Ian Clifton], Gary Randall, the Safety Manager and two others. Mr Clifton advised me that I was to be medically retired to satisfy the Mine's duty of care to me. I was not expecting to be medically retired that day. I was shocked. I was not in a financial position to retire. I had hoped to be able to continue working until I was about 67 years of age. I said my goodbyes to my work crew and work mates and left the site. That was the last day I ever worked as a coal miner.""

The plaintiff seeks legal advice

9The plaintiff's medical expenses up until termination had been paid by his employer. After being medically retired on 11 November 2011, he contacted his union representative ""for advice as to what to do"" (affidavit, paragraph 9). He advised that the plaintiff should seek legal advice. 

10In an apparent inconsistency, the plaintiff said that he consulted a Ms Michelle Lawrence of Emery Partners in or about February 2011, but that she advised him that his condition would have to stabilise before she could give legal advice as to the plaintiff's options and prospects. As the plaintiff had to undergo a total knee replacement on 29 August 2011, and was not formally terminated until 11 November 2011, it seems more likely than not that no formal legal advice was given.

11It was put to the plaintiff that he knew about limitation periods because he had been involved in a serious mining injury in the 1980s when he had been trapped in a mine in Queensland. It was put to him that he knew about common law rights and the three-year limitation period as a result. I propose to treat that submission with caution, as there is no evidence the relevant Queensland limitation period in the 1980s was in fact a three-year period.

12The plaintiff did learn about the limitation period when he consulted Ms Nada Vujat of Emery Partners in about April 2012. The plaintiff's condition still had not stabilised. After a medical assessment by Dr Hopcroft in August 2012, he had a further arthroscopy of the right knee and removal of plates by Dr Workman on 17 December 2012 . However, he was then advised he needed a total right knee replacement on 30 May 2013. Proceedings were then commenced on 24 October 2013.

The parties' submissions

13The plaintiff submits that the degree of seriousness of the plaintiff's injuries and of his inability to continue working were vital questions to answer when determining whether or not to make an election under s 151A Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW). The plaintiff's condition had to stabilise in order for him to obtain an assessment accurately reflecting his medical condition. The defendant had been aware from the first of the nature and extent of the plaintiff's injuries and how they happened, had been continuously informed throughout, and had in fact funded the plaintiff's ongoing treatment. Accordingly, an extension of time should be permitted.

14The defendant submits that an extension of time should not be granted because:

(a)There is evidence that prejudice will be suffered over and above the presumptive prejudice likely by reason of the delay in commencement of proceedings;

(b)The plaintiff's claim advances a case wholly inconsistent with the evidence of injury, in that the description of one accident occurring as pleaded conflicts with the history of other injuries set out in the claim form (Exhibit A);

(c)There is real doubt, from the medical notes of the plaintiff's treating doctor, whether the second accident happened at all, as it is not specifically identified in the notes from Southlakes Medical Group (Exhibit 1); and

(d)The explanation for delay after the plaintiff sought legal advice contains significant gaps.

The relevant principles

15Section 151D relevantly provides:

""Time Limit for Commencement of Court Proceedings against Employer for Damages

...

(2) A person to whom compensation is payable under this Act is not entitled to commence Court proceedings for damages in respect of the injury concerned against the employer liable to pay that compensation more than 3 years after the date on which the injury was received, except with the leave of the court in which the proceedings are to be taken.

(3) The Limitation Act 1969 does not apply to or in respect of court proceedings to which this section applies.""

16The relevant principles are helpfully set out in Merton v Manildra Energy Australia Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1482 at [27]ff per Hoeben CJ at CL, where his Honour sets out the structure of the legislation and its interpretation by Basten JA in Strasburger Enterprises Pty Ltd trading as Quix Food Stores v Serna [2008] NSWCA 354 (with whom Gyles AJA and Hoeben J agreed) at [52]:

""52 With respect to this and similar provisions, which contain no express indication of the matters to be considered in relation to an application to extend time, ""the limits of the discretion are to be found in the subject matter, and the scope and purpose, of the statute"": Salido v Nominal Defendant (1993) 32 NSWLR 524 at 530F (Gleeson CJ); see also 535-539 (Kirby P) and 541 (Powell JA). Subsequently, the High Court provided guidance as to the correct approach inBrisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor [1996] HCA 25 ; 186 CLR 541, although the majority judgments did not speak in identical language and were concerned with a limitation provision which provided some guidance as to factors to be taken into account. As explained in Salvation Army (South Australia Property Trust) v Rundle [2008] NSWCA 347 at [96] by McColl JA:

Brisbane South is authority for the proposition that an application for an extension of time under limitation legislation should be refused if the effect of granting the extension would result in significant prejudice to the potential defendant ... 'Significant prejudice' means such prejudice as would make the chances of a fair trial unlikely ... . For a trial to be fair, it need not be perfect or ideal ... .""

17There is always a presumption of some prejudice where there is a delay of this kind (three years and one year respectively) in commencing proceedings: Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor (1996) 206 CLR 54; I have carefully considered the four rationales explained by McHugh J at 552 - 3. Counsel for both parties referred me to the relevant principles for s 151D(2) as discussed in Itek Graphix Pty Ltd v Elliott (2002) 54 NSWLR 207. Sheller JA, after referring to the fact that ""actual significant prejudice"" might compel a refusal by the court to extend time, added that ""it is not correct to conclude that the absence of such prejudice compels an exercise of discretion in favour of the plaintiff"": at [3]. (Itek was concerned with an additional consideration, namely that the prospective plaintiff had deliberately decided, on an informed basis, not to proceed within the specified period, but that is not the case here.)

18Having noted the importance of ""actual significant prejudice"", I now consider each of the submissions raised by Mr Stanton.

Is there actual prejudice?

19The first two objections (see (a) and (b) above) raised by the defendant are a claim that a fair trial of the proceedings cannot take place because of actual prejudice. The first of these rests on the plaintiff's statement during cross-examination that Mr Randall (to whom the first accident had been reported) had left the defendant's employ some time before 2011. The basis for the second such claim is the asserted inconsistencies between the description of the accident in the statement of claim and the claim form, which Mr Stanton submits are such that the defendant cannot understand whether one or more accidents occurred.

20Mr Randall was the person to whom the accident was reported by the plaintiff. It is agreed that his evidence would be limited to the circumstances surrounding that fact, and to the production of contemporaneous documentation in relation to the reporting of the accident, although his recollection of the circumstances of the time would also be of assistance. 

21The mere fact that Mr Randall is no longer in the employ of the defendant is insufficient to amount to significant prejudice. The highest that such evidence could be put is that, if inquiries are now made, he may not be able to be located, or, if he can be found, he may not be able to recall these events. A similar submission was put in Taouk v Taouk [2010] NSWCA 372 at [73] - [77] but, when read in context, was considered by Sackville AJA to amount to a statement that the delay in reporting the accident may have affected the recollection of persons not asked to give statements at the time, which was insufficient to establish substantial prejudice. In addition, in Taouk, a number of witnesses fell into this category; in the present case, the other witness named by the plaintiff (Mrs Mrsic) was still working there when he left. 

22The plaintiff's application for an extension of time in Taouk was rejected on other grounds, but not on this ground. The evidence in this case is significantly weaker, and must similarly fail.

23Mr Stanton did not articulate how the pleading of the first accident in the statement of claim meant that a fair trial could not take place, beyond conceding that if the statement of claim referred to the plaintiff having prior difficulties in negotiating the mine (which is a ""wet mine"" and therefore prone to slipperiness and uneven surfaces), that would obviate the problem. The extensive medical documents and histories given by the plaintiff should ensure that any uncertainties as to causation issues can be addressed by reference to this material.

24Mr Stanton also submitted that the limited description of the accident on the claim form meant that the precise act of negligence was not clear. In that regard, however, the defendant has a very clear account, in the statement of claim, of the precise description of remedial works the defendant failed to carry out which resulted in this part of the mine being in the state that it was. The particulars of negligence, while general, clearly relate to the circumstances in which the defendant failed to take steps to drain the mine adequately, steps which were later taken by another company, Glencore Xstrata PLC which, by the simple technique of digging trenches which were then filled with rubble, created drains to collect ground water which was then pumped to the surface (see paragraphs 4 - 6 of the statement of claim).

Did the second accident happen?

25Mr Stanton tendered a bundle of records for the Southlakes Medical Group, a medical centre where the plaintiff attended for treatment over the relevant period. He generally saw Dr Thrift but on occasion saw Dr Drew, Dr Shean, Dr Jonker, Dr Osmotherly, Dr Moses, Dr Dao, or one of the nurses . The notes for his visits are brief computer entries.

26Mr Stanton points to the entries for 12 August 2009. He was seen by the registered nurse, Ms Zaska, who only recorded ""History obtained and relevant examination made. Treatment orders given as documented"". He was also seen by Dr Thrift on 14 August, who noted: ""I will complete his W/C form next week when his current limitations are confirmed."" The actions recorded related to letters about the right knee injury only. In addition (although not referred to by counsel) the covering letter briefly listing the plaintiff's treatment in 2007 refers only to ""hypertension"".

27If that were the extent of the documentation, there would be some force in the submission. However, the entry for 17 August notes not only his hypertension problem but adds: ""Discussion as the Second Egress walk exacerbated both knee pain, but it is settling and he has to be able to do it to keep his job."" On this occasion, the entry has been made by Dr Thrift only.

28On 26 August he again saw the nurse and Dr Thrift. The note reads: ""History obtained and relevant examination made. Treatment orders given as documented"". On 2 September he saw Dr Thrift again, who noted:

""He has strained the L knee when doing the Egress on Friday 12/8/09. He had an exacerbation for one week, and then it has partially settled, but not fully resolved. He was advised to report this at work. He enjoys working, but has pain 8/10 in R knee in am, and 8 - 9/10 on the L. It gradually eases to 4/10 for most of the day."" Dr Thrift repeated this history in her letter to Dr Petrelis, adding ""Thank you for your assessment."" There was a bilateral examination of both knees. X-rays were ordered (the reason for which was noted as ""Tender medial meniscus L knee after walking 8 km for Egress"") on 18 September 2009, and a letter to the defendant sent on 28 September 2009. Further entries on October 14 2009 note progress and the creation of letters to the defendant concerning ""both knees"" is noted.

29Whatever the reason for the nurse's failure to make a specific entry for left knee injury on 12 August (or for Dr Thrift to correct this entry, or put it in her own entry on 14 August), subsequent entries a matter of days later clearly document this, as do the medical centre's letters of referral and letters to the defendant. 

30How much weight should be put upon the failure of the nurse and Dr Thrift to note the left knee issue in their entries of 12 and 14 August? The need to exercise a degree of caution in relation to undue parsing and analysing of histories taken by treating medical practitioners has been emphasised by the New South Wales Court of Appeal many times: Davis v Council of the City of Wagga Wagga [2004] NSWCA 34 at [35], Ferguson v McDonalds [2005] NSWCA 401 at [81], Kappadoukas v Fransepp Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 366 at [56]; Container Terminals Australia v Huseyin [2008] NSWCA 320 at [8]; Mastronardi v State of New South Wales [2009] NSWCA 270 at [87]; Mason v Demasi [2009] NSWCA 227 at [2]; Hill v Richards [2011] NSWCA 291 at [23]; Gulic v O'Neill [2011] NSWCA 361 at [24]. This is because:

""Experience teaches that busy doctors sometimes misunderstand or misrecord history of accidents, particularly in circumstances where their concern is with the treatment or impact of an indisputable, frank injury."" (Davis v Council of the City of Wagga Wagga [2004] NSWCA 34 at [35] per Beazley JA)

31The notes made by a general practitioner or nurse working in a busy medical centre need to be seen in that context. The plaintiff has clearly reported his injury and sought treatment. This submission is without merit.

Unexplained gaps in relation to legal advice

32Mr Graham submitted, and I agree, that the election to pursue common law rights is a serious matter. Mines are inherently dangerous, especially ""wet mines"", and the establishment of negligence, as opposed to the comparatively straightforward principles applicable to work injury, is a matter requiring close attention. Proof of the matters set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 in the statement of claim will probably require expert as well as lay evidence. The degree to which the plaintiff is injured is also relevant, and he was having surgery as late as 29 May 2013, when he had a right knee replacement.

33The defendant complains of two periods of delay: February 2011 to April 2012 and April 2012 to October 2013.

34No objection is taken to the plaintiff having delayed commencement of proceedings while he was still working at the mine (until January 2011). In practical terms, the plaintiff's problems crystallised when he was terminated on 11 November 2011. The real issue is thus what I should make of delay during the second period, namely from April 2012 to October 2013.

35While a litigant is supposed to be diligent in his own interest (Wade v Judd [2004] NSWCA 355 at [43]), Mr Iselin consulted a solicitor over the relevant period and understood the solicitors were waiting for his condition to stabilise. Since he underwent a knee replacement a matter of months before the proceedings were started, it is understandable that he trusted the representations of his solicitor: Murdock v Lipman [2012] NSWSC 983 at [22] - [23] per McCallum J. This is not a case where there was a deliberate or informed decision not to commence proceedings, or even that he received conflicting advice: Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd t/as Hunter Valley Operations (Howick Mine) v Stringer [2003] NSWCA 271 at [5] - [6] per Hodgson JA and at [39] - [56] per Foster AJA. Mr Iselin's health concerns and impending operation would have preoccupied him for most of this period, and what little he knew about limitation periods from prior proceedings in Queensland in the 1980s would have been of slight assistance or practical use in understanding his rights and obligations. From my observation of his demeanour in the witness box, Mr Iselin has the same vulnerabilities as those discussed by Foster AJA at [39] - [56], and should be granted the same indulgence of an extension of time.

36I propose to grant the relief sought. 

Costs

37Mr Stanton submitted that the plaintiff should pay the defendant's costs because the plaintiff is seeking the indulgence of an extension of time, this being put to me as the usual order.

38Costs orders are not always made against a plaintiff seeking an extension. For example, in Ryan v Forstaff Engineering Personnel Pty Ltd [2011] NSWSC 1009 at [49], after hearing submissions from both parties, Barr AJ made an order that costs be costs in the proceedings. Hoeben CJ at CL made a similar order in Merton, supra, at [36]. In my view, this is the order that I should also make in these proceedings.

Orders

(1)An order pursuant to s 151D Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW), nunc pro tunc, granting leave to continue these proceedings against the respondent.

(2)Costs to be costs in the proceedings.

		01 July 2014",2014-04-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2421667,Application by Hoai Vinh Tran pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 394,"JudgmentINTRODUCTION1Hoai Vinh Tran (""the applicant"") makes an application pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""the Act"") for an inquiry into the sentence imposed upon him following his conviction for the murder of Phuoc Dang.  
2The applicant was found guilty on 28 October 2009 following a trial before Mathews AJ and a jury.  On 18 December 2009 her Honour sentenced the applicant to a non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment commencing on 7 November 2007 and expiring on 6 November 2027, with a balance of term of 6 years, commencing on 7 November 2027 and expiring on 6 November 2033.
3The applicant has submitted that the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  In making the application, the applicant has argued that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance, namely that the sentence imposed upon him was infected by error in light of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.
4The principles which apply to an application such as this are set out in full in The Application of Victor Makarov pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 NSW [2013] NSWSC 1468 at [5]-[6].
THE APPLICANT'S CONVICTION AND SENTENCE5The applicant was jointly tried with Chethona Im.  The jury found Mr Im not guilty of the charge of murder.
6When sentencing the applicant (see R v Tran [2009] NSWSC 1437) her Honour made a series of factual findings (at [2]-[20]) before proceeding to considering various aggravating and mitigating factors.  Her Honour found at [21] that the offence was aggravated because it was committed in company and concluded (at [25]) that the offence fell generally within the middle range of seriousness.  
7Her Honour then turned (commencing at [26]) to consider the applicant's personal circumstances before giving consideration (commencing at [36]) to the various factors set out in s. 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"").  Her Honour then concluded (at [40]):
""Having considered all the evidence I can find no reason to depart from the standard non-parole period for murder, nor from the statutory nexus between the non-parole period and the balance of the sentence.""
8Following his sentence, the applicant sought leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  In doing so, the applicant advanced two grounds, namely:
(i)that her Honour had erred in finding that the offence was aggravated because it was committed in company; and 
(ii)that it was not open to her Honour to assess the offence as falling within the middle range of objective seriousness.
9The Court of Criminal Appeal (see Tran v R [2011] NSWCCA 116) concluded (at [22]) that the first of those grounds was made out.  In those circumstances, it was not necessary to consider the second ground.
10The Court then proceeded to re-sentence the applicant.  Hidden J (with whom Whealy JA and Johnson J agreed) undertook a brief review of some earlier decisions of the Court in cases of sentences imposed for murder.  Having done so, his Honour said (at [39]):
""What emerges from these cases is what one would expect. Whether a killing was premeditated or, in any event, whether it was accompanied by an intention to kill are important questions in an assessment of where a murder lies in the range of objective gravity, but of themselves are not necessarily determinative. Invariably, there will be other circumstances in the particular case bearing on that assessment. "" 
11Having referred to the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76 his Honour continued (at [39]):
""Of course, the assessment of the objective gravity of an offence is an important aspect of any sentencing exercise, and one which requires careful consideration. For obvious reasons, this is particularly so when sentencing for offences for which a standard non-parole period is prescribed."" 12His Honour then concluded (commencing at [41]) that the Court should intervene and re-sentence the applicant.  In doing so, his Honour expressly had regard to the applicant's criminal history and personal background which he had earlier summarised (at [13]-[19]) before concluding (at [41]) that the appropriate sentence was a non-parole period of 18 years imprisonment with a balance of term of 6 years imprisonment, a total sentence of 24 years imprisonment.
13In Muldrock (supra) the High Court concluded (at [25]) that it was an error to categorise s. 54B(2) of the Sentencing Act as being framed in mandatory terms which required the court to use the standard non-parole period as the starting point for determining whether an offence was appropriately assessed as being in the middle of the range.  The Court concluded (at [26]) that it was a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period, and held that the correct approach was to identify all relevant factors (including any prescribed standard non-parole period) and make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence.
14Further (at [28]) the Court specifically rejected the adoption of a two-stage approach to sentencing, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, followed by an inquiry as to whether there are matters justifying the imposition of a non-parole period which is longer or shorter than that prescribed.
15In arriving at these conclusions, the Court held that R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 had been wrongly decided.
SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES16It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that Mathews AJ had clearly adopted a two-stage approach to sentencing which gave determinative significance to the standard non-parole period.
17It was further submitted that the observations of Hidden J in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal (at [39]) ""suggested an adherence to the two-stage approach and an emphasis on the classification of the objective seriousness of the offence"".  It was argued that had the Court applied what were submitted to be the correct principles in the determination of the appeal there was ""a real probability"" that a lesser sentence would have been imposed.
18Counsel for the Attorney-General submitted firstly, that a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance could not arise by reference to Muldrock - type error.  However, as Johnson J pointed out in The Application of Joy Lorraine Knight pursuant to s. 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act [2014] NSWSC 285 at [17] such a submission cannot be sustained in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Sinkovich v Attorney-General of NSW [2013] NSWCA 383.
19Counsel for the Attorney-General further submitted that although it was apparent that an incorrect approach was adopted by Mathews AJ at first instance, this was not so in the case of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Counsel pointed out that in delivering the Court's judgment, Hidden J did not state that the standard non-parole period was mandatory, and submitted that his Honour did not impermissibly confine the exercise of the sentencing discretion.
CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION20In my view, there is little doubt that when originally sentencing the applicant, Mathews AJ adopted an approach to sentencing which the High Court in Muldrock subsequently concluded was erroneous. It is evident from paragraph [40] of the judgment that her Honour gave the standard non-parole period primary significance, and engaged in a two-stage approach to sentencing.  
21However in my view, the same cannot be said of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Emphasis was placed by the applicant on paragraph [39] of the judgment of Hidden J which was said to suggest an adherence to a two-stage sentencing process, as well as an emphasis on the classification of the objective seriousness of the offence.  In my view, there is nothing within that paragraph which conveys any such suggestion.  
22It is erroneous to approach the question of whether an error of the kind asserted in the present case is made out by concentrating on an isolated passage of the relevant judgment.  The Court of Criminal Appeal has observed on numerous occasions that when considering whether or not a Muldrock-type error has been made out it is necessary to view the reasons for the sentence as a whole, and not confine examination to one particular passage or sentence which is said to reflect error (see for example Black v R [2013] NSWCCA 265 at [41] and the authorities cited therein).
23In my view, when the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal is read as a whole, it is evident that the passage highlighted by the applicant came at the end of Hidden J's review of various decisions to which the Court had been referred.  His Honour's observations that the assessment of the objective gravity of an offence was an important aspect of any sentencing exercise, and was one which required careful consideration, were perfectly correct.  There is no indication whatsoever, be it in that passage or in the judgment as a whole, that his Honour gave primary or determinative significance to the standard non-parole period.  On the contrary, it is evident that his Honour considered both the objective seriousness of the offending, and the applicant's subjective case.  
24His Honour's consideration of the entirety of those matters tends against a conclusion that primary or determinative significance was given to the standard non-parole period or that a two-stage process of sentencing was adopted.  Rather, Hidden J arrived at his conclusions by adopting an approach which was consistent with a process of instinctive synthesis, in which he identified all relevant factors, and reached a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence.




CONCLUSION25For the reasons set out above, I am not persuaded that any Muldrock-type error occurred when the applicant was re-sentenced by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Accordingly, I do not entertain any doubt or question as to the existence of a mitigating circumstance in the applicant's case.
26The application is therefore refused.

		16 April 2014",2014-04-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2421860,JP v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions [2014] NSWChC 2,"Judgment

Reasons for Decision

BACKGROUND
1This judgment relates to an application for costs made on behalf of the accused Young Person, JP.

2Briefly, the procedural background is that on 11 December 2012 the Young Person was arrested and charged with two counts contrary to s 474.19(1) of the (Commonwealth) Criminal Code Act 1995, alleging offences between 23 May 2012 and 11 December 2012 at Fairy Meadow (sequence 1), and on 27 August 2012, also at Fairy Meadow (sequence 2), that he used a carriage service to transmit child pornography material. At the date of his arrest, the Young Person was aged 15.

3The Young Person was released on bail and was served with Court Attendance Notices to appear in relation to these two charges at Port Kembla Children's Court on 21 January 2013. The Young Person appeared on that date, represented by Mr Russoniello. The Court made brief orders, requiring the prosecution to serve the brief by 25 February 2013 and the matter was adjourned for a reply to the brief at Port Kembla on 11 March 2013.

4On 30 January 2013 the prosecution filed two additional Court Attendance Notices at the Court, alleging further breaches of s 474.19(1), namely offences allegedly committed at Fairy Meadow on 10 August 2012 (later amended to 8 October 2012) (sequence 3) and between 23 May 2011 and 1 September 2012 (sequence 4) at Fairy Meadow.

5The proceedings were subsequently listed for mention and/or reply to the brief on 11 March, 6 May, 17 June, 1 July, and 22 July 2013 when the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (hereafter referred as the DPP), sought a 3 month adjournment, to 21 October 2013, to obtain evidence from the United States of America, in relation to Facebook material. On 21 October 2013 the evidence had been received from the USA and the matter was adjourned to 11 November 2013, to enable discussions to take place between the prosecution and the defence, and for the DPP to review the charges.

6On 11 November 2013 the proceedings were adjourned to 18 November 2013 for the Court to make enquiries in relation to setting the matter down for hearing as a special fixture. On the last mentioned date, the matter was set down for hearing at Port Kembla Children's Court, as a special fixture, on 17, 18 and 19 March 2014. On 29 November 2013 the hearing dates were changed to 18, 19 and 20 March 2014, when it became known that one of the parties was not available on 17 March 2014. On 17 February 2014, the matter was listed for mention and the hearing dates of 18, 19 and 20 March 2014 were confirmed.

7On 10 March 2014 two additional Court Attendance Notices were issued and filed with the Court, alleging breaches of s 474.17(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995, namely offences of using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend on 10 August 2012 (sequence 5) and on 27 August 2012 (sequence 6).

8On the same date, 10 March 2014, the DPP forwarded an email to Mr Russoniello advising him about the two new charges, which were replacing sequences 2 and 3, and that sequences 1 and 4 would be withdrawn.

REFUSAL OF ADJOURNMENT APPLICATION 
9On 17 March 2014 the matter was listed for mention, at the request of the DPP, when the DPP made application to vacate the hearing dates. The defence opposed this application. After submissions from the parties, the Court refused the application to vacate the hearing dates, having regard to the age of the proceedings, the lateness of the application, with the hearing due to commence as a special fixture on the following day, and that the DPP had indicated as early as 21 October 2013 that the charges were being reviewed. The Court indicated that if at the end of the hearing of the available prosecution evidence, the DPP needed to call an expert witness, the proceedings could be adjourned part heard for that purpose.

10On 17 March 2014 the DPP withdrew sequences 1 to 4, and these charges were dismissed. When the Court refused to vacate the hearing dates, the DPP also withdrew the two fresh charges, sequences 5 and 6. The DPP placed on record that these charges were withdrawn with prejudice, pursuant to s 208 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The Court also dismissed these two charges.

11Mr Russoniello indicated that he would be making an application for costs and the proceedings were adjourned for this purpose to 14 April 2014.

COSTS APPLICATION 
12On the last mentioned date, Mr Russoniello made an application for costs, pursuant to s 213 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

Proceedings ""invalid""
13The main thrust of his submission, it appears to me, was that the proceedings commenced by the DPP were invalid. He submitted that s 213(3)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that the Court may order the prosecutor in summary proceedings to pay professional costs if the matter is dismissed because the proceedings are for any reason invalid.

14Mr Russoniello submitted that the proceedings were invalid because the accused Young Person was under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged offences, and the DPP failed to obtain the consent of the Attorney General prior to the commencement of the proceedings. Mr Russoniello relied on the provisions of s 474.24C of the Criminal Code Act 1995.

15There is no dispute that the DPP did not seek the consent of the Attorney General in this matter until 7 February 2014.

16It is convenient to set out the provisions of s 213 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and s 474.24C of the Criminal Code Act 1995:
213 When professional costs may be awarded to accused persons 
(1) A court may at the end of summary proceedings order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar of the court, for payment to the accused person, if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn.

(2) The amount of professional costs is to be the amount that the Magistrate considers to be just and reasonable.

(3) Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), a court may order that the prosecutor in summary proceedings pay professional costs if the matter is dismissed because: 
(a) the prosecutor fails to appear or both the prosecutor and the accused person fail to appear, or
(b) the matter is withdrawn or the proceedings are for any reason invalid.

(4) (Repealed)

(5) The order must specify the amount of professional costs payable.

474.24C Consent to commencement of proceedings where defendant under 18 
(1) Proceedings for an offence against this Subdivision must not be commenced without the consent of the Attorney General if the defendant was under18 at the time he or she allegedly engaged in the conduct constituting the offence.

(2) However, a person may be arrested for, charged with, or remanded in custody or on bail in connection with, such an offence before the necessary consent has been given.

17Mr Russoniello submitted that it is well accepted that criminal proceedings commence when a Court Attendance Notice is filed in the Court. In this case, Court Attendance Notices were issues in December 2012 and on 30 January 2013.

18 Mr Russoniello submitted, as I understand his submission, that in relation to paragraph (2) of s 474.24C of the Criminal Code Act 1995, that provision does not apply to persons under the age of 18 years, rather it applies to persons above the age of 18.

19Mr Russoniello referred to the Senate Report on the Bill which introduced s 474.24C, emphasising that the legislation had a case such as this in mind when the consent of the Attorney General was required before proceedings were commenced.

20The relevant part of the Senate Report is in the following terms:
3.55. In a similar vein, the committee notes that police and prosecutorial discretion is an important element of ensuring that the new and existing child sex offences will not operate to unduly capture young people who may be involved or participate in the practice of 'sexting'. While the committee acknowledges that the practice may be undesirable, it agrees with arguments that young people engaged in such behaviour should not be exposed to the grave consequences and stigma that attach to allegations of, and convictions for, child sexual offences.
3.56 In light of the evidence provided in relation to sexting, the committee is inclined to favour calls for the discretion of the Attorney General to be extended in relation to prosecutions of people under 18 years of age for child sex offences.....The committee is of the view that the extension of this safeguard may ensure that behaviour which is not exploitative of, or harmful to, children is not captured by the child sex offence regime (particularly where that behaviour involves children themselves).

21Mr Russoniello submitted that if the all of the information had been analysed and made available to the Attorney General, it would have been apparent that the evidence did not support the charges that there had been a transmission of pornography; rather it would have been a case of ""sexting"" as contemplated in the Senate Report. 

22 For this reason, in the absence of the Attorney General's consent, Mr Russoniello submits the proceedings are invalid, for the purposes of s 213(3)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

Alternative basis for costs application - withdrawal of the matter
23If the Court does not accept the submission that the proceedings were invalid, Mr Russoniello, further submits that the withdrawal of the charges by the DPP, triggers the ability of the Court to award professional costs pursuant to s 213(3)(b).

24In conclusion, Mr Russoniello submitted that if the Court is satisfied that a sufficient basis has been made out under s 213 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 for an order for costs, the Court could also be satisfied in relation to each of the matters listed in s 214(1) of the Act. Mr Russoniello did not, however, elaborate or make any further or specific submissions in relation to the provisions of s 214(1).

25Section 214(1) is in the following terms:
214 Limit on award of professional costs to accused person against prosecutor acting in public capacity 
(1) Professional costs are not to be awarded in favour of an accused person in summary proceedings unless the court is satisfied as to any one or more of the following: 
(a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner,
(b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner,
(c) that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought,
(d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award professional costs.

(2) This section does not apply to the awarding of costs against a prosecutor acting in a private capacity.

(3) An officer of an approved charitable organisation under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979 is taken not to be acting in a private capacity if the officer acts as the prosecutor in any proceedings under that Act or section 9 (1) of the Veterinary Practice Act 2003. 

DPP SUBMISSIONS

26In response to the application for costs by Mr Russoniello, Ms Talbot filed written submissions on behalf of the DPP. Oral submissions were also made in response to Mr Russoniello's oral submissions.

27Ms Talbot submitted that an applicant for costs under s 213 must meet a high threshold to establish any matter listed in s 214(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

28In her oral submissions Ms Talbot submitted that she disagreed with the submission of Mr Russoniello in relation to the consent provisions set out in s 474.24C of the Criminal Code Act 1995. Ms Talbot submitted that ss (2) allows for the arrest and charging of a person under the age of 18 without the consent of the Attorney General, despite the provisions of ss (1).

29Ms Talbot submitted that having regard to the alleged actions of the accused Young Person, which are reflected in the original statement of facts tendered to the Court during the course of this application (see below), those actions could not be described as ""sexting"", as referred to in the Senate Report. Rather the actions of the Young Person amounted to blackmail, with him using a false name/false accounts to acquire child pornography, using threats of publication of child pornographic material.

30Ms Talbot rejects any suggestion that the proceedings were commenced without any evidence. The prosecution had undertaken a full investigation, that had included the taking of statements from the victims, obtaining evidence from the USA by way of Mutual Assistance Requests, obtaining telephone records, seizing materials under warrant in relation to the use of accounts, etc.

31In relation to the decision to withdraw some of the charges, Ms Talbot submitted that this was done following conferencing with child witnesses, taking into account their wishes and their evidence, and having regard to policy considerations. The charges were not withdrawn because there was no evidence or insufficient evidence.

32Ms Talbot reminded the Court that the onus was on the applicant to establish that the requirements of s 214 had been established. The prosecution submits that there is no evidence of any matters set out in the section.

33Ms Talbot referred to the expert evidence that the prosecution were seeking to obtain, when the application for the adjournment was made on 17 March 2014. In particular the DPP was seeking to call an expert to establish the use of ""a carriage service"", which is an essential element of the two charges the prosecution were intending to prosecute at the hearing. Ms Talbot submitted that this was a technical issue. Even though the legislation provides for a presumption in favour of the prosecution, the defence nevertheless are able to rebut the presumption, so out of an abundance of caution, the DPP were intending to seek the evidence of an expert to establish the use of ""a carriage service"".

ADJUDICATION
34I will deal first with Mr Russoniello's main submission, that the proceedings were commenced without the consent of the Attorney General and accordingly they were invalid.

35It is necessary to determine what is meant by the term ""commencement of proceedings"" in the context of the current proceedings and the provisions of s 474.24C of the Criminal Code Act 1995.

36In this regard, Mr Russoniello submitted that it is well understood, and accepted, that proceedings are commenced on the date when a Court Attendance Notice is filed. Mr Russoniello did not refer to any specific legislative provision, or judicial authority, in making this submission. 

37There are several provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 that establish such a proposition, for example, Part 2 of the Act dealing with ""Trial procedures in lower courts"", Division 1 ""Commencement of proceedings"". In particular sections 172 and 178 provide as follows:
172 Commencement of proceedings by court attendance notice 
(1) Proceedings for an offence are to be commenced in a court by the issue and filing of a court attendance notice in accordance with this Division.

178 When proceedings commence
(1) All proceedings are taken to have commenced on the date on which a court attendance notice is filed in the registry of a relevant court in accordance with this Division.

38Paragraph (3) of s 178, however, is important in the context of the subject costs application. It provides:
(3) Nothing in this section affects any other Act or law under which proceedings are taken to have been commenced on another date.

39In relation to Mr Russoniello's submission that paragraph 2 of s 474.24C does not apply to persons under the age of 18 years, I am not able to accept this submission. That paragraph, or subsection, is expressed as follows: ""However, a person may be arrested for, charged with, or remanded in custody or on bail in connection with, such an offence before the necessary consent has been given."" These emphasised words, in my view, make if abundantly clear that they relate to persons under the age of 18 years, in respect of whom consent is required, and are not meant to apply to persons over the age of 18 years, and in respect of whom consent is not required before proceedings can be commenced. Section 178(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 also makes it clear that other Acts or laws may specify a different commencement date, and not when a Court Attendance Notice is issued.

40In the context of the circumstances of the prosecution of the accused Young Person, and having regard to the terms of s 474.24C of the Criminal Code Act 1995, I am satisfied that the proceedings for the offences involving the accused Young Person were to commence on 18 March 2014, that is the first date of the hearing.

41When the charges were withdrawn on 17 March 2014, the proceedings had not commenced within the meaning of s 474.24C of the Criminal Code Act 1995. Accordingly, I am satisfied the proceedings were not invalid when the charges were withdrawn on that date.

42Turning to Mr Russoniello's alternative submission that s 213 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 has been triggered by the withdrawal of the charges on 17 March 2014, I am satisfied that this ground has been established.

43Accordingly, it is necessary to have regard to the provision of s 214 of the Act, which provides limitations on the Court's power to award costs. The provisions of the section are set out above. The relevant considerations are repeated here for convenience:
Professional costs are not to be awarded in favour of an accused person in summary proceedings unless the court is satisfied as to any one or more of the following: 
(a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner,
(b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner,
(c) that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought,
(d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award professional costs.

44It has already been mentioned above that Mr Russoniello did not make any specific submissions in relation to s 214(1), merely stating that the Court would be satisfied in respect of all of the listed limitations. In response, in the DPP's written and oral submissions contend, and I accept, that an applicant must meet a high threshold to establish any of the matters listed in s 214(1).

45The allegations made against the accused Young Person are serious. They are contained in the initial police statement of facts, which were provided to the Court for the purpose of this application. The relevant parts of those facts are as follows:
""Some time in May 2014, a 14 year old female.....victim 'J' was 'friended' on the social networking site Facebook by a person assuming the online identity of a 21 year old female, hereinafter referred to as witness 'B'. Victim 'J' and witness 'B' do not know one another, other than via Facebook.

""On 23 May 2012, victim 'J' received an online message from the Facebook profile of witness 'B'. It is alleged that at this time the Facebook profile of witness 'B' was being utilised by (the accused Young Person).

""During the initial online communication the young person, whilst using witness 'B's' profile, informed victim 'J' that witness 'B' was being held against her will by a person named (ZJ) and that if victim 'J' did not send naked photographs of her breasts and vagina to witness 'B's' Facebook profile that witness 'B' would be injured by ZJ.

""Due to persistent pressure being placed on victim 'J' by the young person (under the online identity of witness 'B'), victim 'J' took photographs (six in total) of her naked breasts and vagina and sent them via Facebook to the Young person.

""Shortly after this, victim 'J' blocked the Facebook profile of witness 'B' so that no further messages could be sent by that profile to her.

""On 27 August 2012, a female aged 14, hereinafter referred to as victim 'D' engaged in an online communication with the young person. During these communications the young person was using the assumed online identity of (the male) ZJ.

""During this online communication the young person requested victim 'D' to send him naked photographs of her breasts. Victim 'D' refused to do this and as a result, the young person informed victim 'D' that he was in possession of several photographs of victim 'J' and that if victim 'D' did not send the photographs of herself, the young person would post the photographs of victim 'J' on Facebook.

""Victim 'D' refused to send any photographs of herself. The young person proceeded to send victim 'D' six photographs of victim 'J''. Each of these photographs depicted the victim's naked breasts and/or vagina. Several of these photographs showed the victim's face.

""On 11 December 2012, police attended.....to execute (a search warrant)......""

46The Court has not been presented with any evidence that the ""investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner"". Notwithstanding the age of the Young Person when the offences were committed, the allegations are serious and indicate a reasonable level of planning. It cannot be said, in my view that the alleged conduct amounts to ""sexting"" within the context of the Senate Report mentioned above.

47The investigation of the allegations, involving international components, were complicated and time consuming. Whilst one may question the delay in relation to the laying of the two new charges on 10 March 2014, when it indicated that the charges were being reviewed in October 2013, this delay does not establish in my view that the investigations were conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner. One may also question the lateness in seeking the consent of the Attorney General, only a little over a month before the hearing was due to commence, but this does not make the investigation unreasonable or improper.

48Neither has the Court been presented with any evidence that the ""proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner.""

49Nothing has been raised suggesting that the prosecutor failed to investigate, unreasonably or otherwise, any relevant matter which might suggest that the Young Person is not guilty or for any other reason the proceedings should not have been brought.

50Finally, the Court has not been provided with details of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecution, which might suggest that it is just and reasonable to award professional costs. The only issue, to the Court's mind, that may suggest that it is just and reasonable to award costs, is the delay in bringing the fresh charges and the late application to adjourn the hearing on 18 March this year.

51The Court is not satisfied, however, that it is proper to make an order for costs on this basis having regard to the complexity of the investigation and the age of the alleged victims, which also involved proper policy considerations.

52For this reason I am not satisfied that the applicant has satisfied the Court that costs should be awarded.

53The application is therefore dismissed.

		07 May 2014",2014-05-04 00:00:00,NSW Children's Court
2421892,McCann v R [2014] NSWCCA 79,"Judgment
1THE COURT:  On 9 May 2014, after hearing fully from the Crown in relation to the first ground of appeal, that the appellant's conviction was unreasonable within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), we ordered that to the extent necessary, there be a grant of leave, that the appeal be allowed, that the appellant's conviction on Count 2 of the indictment be quashed and that an acquittal be entered.  These are our reasons for making those orders.
The course of the trial
2The appellant was charged with one count of indecent assault upon a child aged under 10 years, contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (in the form it then took), and two counts of sexual intercourse with a child aged under 10 years, contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act.  He pleaded not guilty.  He was tried by judge and a jury.  The trial commenced on Tuesday 12 March 2013.  The Crown case closed on Friday 15 March 2013, and there was no defence case.  Counsel addressed and the judge summed up to the jury on Tuesday 19 March.  
3The jury retired late on the afternoon of Tuesday and continued their deliberations on the Wednesday.  One juror had to attend a funeral on Thursday, and the trial was adjourned until Friday 22 March.  That morning, the judge received a note which stated:
""After much deliberation the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision.  If given more time the jury does not believe a unanimous verdict will be able to be reached.  Given the evidence presented the jury would appreciate any guidance the judge might be able to give at this time as we are unsure how best to proceed.""
4The primary judge gave a direction in accordance with Black v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 44.  The jury's deliberations continued for most of that day.  The judge was told in the afternoon that there continued to be a possibility that the jury could reach a unanimous verdict.  On the afternoon of Monday 25 March 2013 the jury again communicated that there was the possibility of a unanimous verdict, but that more time was required.  On Tuesday 26 March 2013 the jury returned with a unanimous verdict of not guilty on the first and third Counts, and guilty on the second Count.
5The appellant had been granted bail throughout the trial.  The Crown did not oppose bail being continued after the verdict.  After imposing a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years on 6 September 2013, the trial judge continued bail, a notice of intention to appeal on conviction having been lodged.  
6His Honour recognised that the power to continue bail after imposing a custodial sentence was very rarely exercised.  In his sentencing remarks, his Honour said:
""I consider that only in exceptional circumstances would the District Court grant bail to an offender after a conviction before a jury.  I consider these circumstances are exceptional.""
7His Honour was evidently concerned about the jury's verdicts.  His Honour said:
""...the issue about unsafe and unsatisfactory is entirely a matter for the Superior Court ... It's not a matter for me.  There was a time when District Court used to intrude into that and actually discharge juries on the basis of unsafe and unsatisfactory - I don't know if you remember that, directed verdicts.  Directed verdicts, where a District Court judge would say I think any conviction here would be unsafe and unsatisfactory and direct a jury to convict.  That went on for some years until the Court of Appeal said no, that's our function under the Act, not the judge at first instance.""  
8In his Honour's sentencing remarks, he said:
""I am also conscious of the fact that there may well be agitated in the Court of Criminal Appeal the inconsistency of the verdicts and consideration of the issue as to whether the conviction on one of the four charges available would lead that Court to conclude that the conviction was unsafe or unsatisfactory.  That matter is exclusively for the Court of Criminal Appeal.""
9During the proceedings after conviction, the judge expressed an inclination to issue a certificate under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  If issued with a certificate under that paragraph, a person convicted on indictment may appeal as of right on grounds which extend beyond questions of law.  It is not clear from the appeal materials whether in fact a s 5(1)(b) certificate was issued.  The first ground of appeal is not a pure question of law, and so out of an abundance of caution, we granted leave to the extent necessary.
The Crown case at trial
10The appellant was a friend of the complainant's father, and the appellant and his partner and their child moved into the complainant's house in Rockdale, Sydney, in 1992.  In early 1993, all moved to another house in Bexley.
11The Crown case at trial was that the appellant had assaulted the complainant on two occasions in 1992 and 1993, when she was aged 5.  When the complainant gave evidence, she was 25.  
12The first occasion was in the house in Rockdale, which had an under croft area under the house.  The complainant said that while the appellant was reading a book to her, he rubbed her leg and touched her on the outside of her underwear near her vagina.  She said, ""I don't know if he meant to touch my vagina but he did.""  This was the first Count on the indictment, of which the appellant was acquitted.
13The second occasion was when the families were living in Bexley.  The complainant said that she was driven by the appellant in a blue Toyota Crown to a park, at night.  She said that the appellant pulled down her pants and underpants and licked and kissed her vagina and inserted his finger into her vagina.  The cunnilingus was the second Count on the indictment, of which the appellant was convicted.  The digital penetration was the third Count on the indictment, of which he was acquitted.
14The complainant's evidence in chief in relation to the second and third Counts was:
""A.  Then he started kissing and licking my vagina and at around the same time he used his finger and put it halfway in my vagina and he was moving it around.  He was kissing at the same time.
...
Q.  When the accused was licking and kissing your vagina, what was he doing in terms of his movements?A.  That's all he was doing.
Q.  And you said at around the same time he put his finger I think you said halfway into your vagina, how long had he been licking and kissing before he did that with his finger?A.  Not very long.
Q.  You said you felt some pain?A.  That's right.""
15The complainant made no complaint at the time.  She made a statement in 2007, some 15 years later.  
16There were inconsistencies between the statement in 2007 and her evidence in 2013 (we pause to note that it would be more surprising if there were no inconsistencies).  In her 2007 statement the complainant had said in relation to the first Count that ""I don't remember him going near my vagina area"".  In relation to the third Count, she had made no reference to feeling any pain.  The complainant was cross-examined on the inconsistencies.  In her statement the complainant had also said that the appellant had taken her for a drive in her father's blue Ford.  Her evidence was that it was a blue Toyota Crown.  In cross-examination, the complainant had originally said that she had not looked at any home video footage; she accepted that that evidence was incorrect:
Q.  So when you said earlier you didn't look at any video footage that was incorrect, is that right?A.  I didn't think that that was important.
Q.  Well, telling the truth in Court is important so when you said earlier that you didn't look at the home video footage that was incorrect, is that right?A.  That's incorrect.  But, I just - I - we watched it but only for the purpose of my dad.  I happened to be at his [house] and he put it on.  I didn't sit through the whole thing and watch it.
Q.  Well the fact is you sat with your dad and watched the video footage - home video footage before you gave evidence in this Court, that's correct, isn't it?A.  Yes.
The Crown submissions on appeal
17The Crown defended the decision on the basis that the jury's verdicts were explicable by the facts that there were weaknesses and inconsistencies in relation to the complainant's evidence in respect of Counts 1 and 3, but not Count 2.  In relation to Count 1, the Crown said that the acquittal might have been based on the concession that the appellant might not have touched, or might not have intended to touch, her vagina.  In relation to Count 3, the Crown said that the acquittal might have been based on the inconsistency between the complainant's evidence in 2013 and the absence of any mention of pain in her statement in 2007.  However, said the Crown, there were no inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence in relation to Count 2.
18The Crown insisted that the events of Count 2 could be differentiated from those of Count 3.  The Crown took issue with the appellant's submission that the events took place ""at the same time"".  The Crown placed emphasis on the complainant's evidence that the events took place ""at around the same time"" and the fact that the licking and kissing had been occurring before the digital penetration.
The guilty verdict must be set aside
19It is plain that the fact that a jury returns different verdicts in a pure word-on-word case does not of itself mean that the guilty verdict is liable to be set aside.  This Court has consistently emphasised that it all depends on the facts of the particular case:  R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82 at [65], [73] and [99] (Spigelman CJ, with whom Carruthers AJ agreed), [217]-[219] and [224] (Wood CJ at CL); R v NEK [2001] NSWCCA 392 at [24] (Priestley JA, with whom Sully J and Smart AJ agreed); R v Bonat [2004] NSWCCA 240 at [106] (Sperling J, with whom Sheller JA and Adams J agreed).  The most recent application is Peiris v R [2014] NSWCCA 58, where the authorities are reviewed at [22]-[25].
20Yet the Crown's submissions must be rejected.  First, it is not the case that there were no inconsistencies in relation to Count 2.  The complainant gave evidence that the conduct that was the subject of Counts 2 and 3 had taken place in a blue Toyota Crown, contrary to what she had said in her 2007 statement.  Secondly, the complainant gave evidence in relation to Count 2 in the same sentence as her evidence in relation to Count 3.  It is true that at one stage the complainant said that the penetration took place ""at around the same time"" as the licking and kissing.  However, in the same answer the complainant said the kissing and penetration were happening ""at the same time"".  There is no sound basis to differentiate the complainant's evidence in relation to Count 2 and her evidence in relation to Count 3.
21Of course, this Court did not see the complainant give evidence.  Nevertheless, the transcript of her evidence answers the description given in Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 453 by Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ, who said (at 453):
""It is difficult then to see how it was open to the jury to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant with respect to the first and third counts.  There is nothing in the complainant's evidence or the surrounding circumstances which gives any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the second count.""
22In MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606 at [85]-[86], McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ said:
""In judging suggested inconsistency, this Court said in MacKenzie ((1996) 190 CLR 348 at 367) that 'if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted'...
Nevertheless, cases do arise where different verdicts returned by a jury represent 'an affront to logic and common sense' and suggest a compromise in the performance of the jury's duty (MacKenzie at 368).  Such a conclusion 'depends upon the facts of the case'. There can be no 'hard and fast rules' except that the obligation to demonstrate inconsistency in jury verdicts rests upon the person making the submission (MacKenzie at 368).""
23Here, for the reasons we have given, there is no proper way to reconcile the jury's verdicts.  Our conclusions are fortified by two related considerations.  
24The first is the circumstances surrounding the way in which the jury reached its verdicts.  We acknowledge that the task of drawing inferences as to the manner in which a jury deliberated is generally fraught with uncertainty but there are some aspects in this case that are concerning.  The jury's deliberations lasted longer than the trial.  The sequence of events, and the notes supplied to the primary judge (which have been only incompletely summarised above) heighten our doubts about the quality of the jury's verdict.  It strongly suggests a compromise of the performance of the jury's duty:  MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 368.
25Secondly, there is the fact that those best placed to assess the quality of the verdict - the judge and counsel - reacted at the time in the manner recorded above.  Those concerns are reflected in the transcript, in the judge's remarks on sentence, and in the grant of bail, which was unopposed by the Crown.  
26As was implicitly recognised by the primary judge, the guilty verdict cannot stand.  
Orders
27This is a case where the acquittal on Count 3 made it appropriate to enter an acquittal on Count 2:  the latter verdict ""carries forward the logic of the other acquittals"":  MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 368.
28In the circumstances, it was not necessary to hear argument on the appellant's second ground, the failure to give a Markuleski direction, and we say nothing in that respect.

		15 May 2014",2014-05-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2421945,R v Papara [2014] NSWDC 120,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Today I am sentencing for an offence where a young man, whilst drunk, has committed an act of violence. 

2How many times do the courts begin their remarks on sentence with those words? The community is rightfully sick and tired of conduct such as I am about to describe. What makes things worse in the matter of Caine Papara who appears for sentence, is that he has done this repeatedly. He does not seem to have learnt the connection between committing criminal offences and drinking. Hopefully the sentence I am about to impose upon him will make him realise what he has been doing wrong.

3After he had finished his HSC he went to schoolies up in Queensland. Whilst drunk he assaulted a police officer by pushing him in the chest. No conviction was recorded, presumably because of his age and intoxication, but he was fined $700. 

4A short time later he committed the offence for which I must sentence him, an event of aggravated break enter and commit affray in company.

5I will get back to the circumstances of that in a little while, but after committing that offence, and before his arrest for it, he committed two other offences whilst drunk, an offence of affray and an offence of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, (and his stepfather told me in evidence today that the weapon with which he was armed was a knife).

6So in between the matter in Queensland and the matter for which he was dealt with in Waverley Local Court, receiving s 9 bonds, he committed this offence.

7It was the night of the Mardi Gras 2 March 2013. He was out with a number of his friends, in particular his girlfriend at the time Crystal Hartley. They went to a convenience store. Matters proceeded without incident until, unbeknown to the offender, one of the people he was with attempted to steal a bottle of Coca Cola. The operators of the convenience store locked the doors in order to prevent the people inside leaving. The offender was outside with some of his friends. A melee broke out inside the store between the offender's girlfriend, the female who had attempted to steal the Coke bottle and the people working in the store. The offender responded to this by attempting to break into the store to assist his then girlfriend. He and his friends were pushing on the main entrance door, kicking at it and reefing at it. Eventually they managed to break the door open and the offender and his three female companions entered the store. What I have described is bad enough, but what happened afterwards is disgraceful.

8Upon entering the store the offender immediately approached one of the workers, a Mr Zhang. He cornered him against the ice cream machine near the front of the store and punched him at least nine times in quick succession using his right hand. He was aiming these punches at the head and torso of Mr Zhang while Mr Zhang was crouched on the ground with his arms raised up to protect his head. Did Mr Papara then stop? No he did not. He then turned his attention to one of the female employees. He approached her and pushed her in the chest area, causing her to stumble backwards and collide with a wall a number of steps behind her. His parting shot was to verbally abuse the people inside the store until he left the store, the last of the people to leave. He ran away.

9It was not for some months that he was arrested. Police discovered his fingerprints and were able to get a DNA sample, but they had nothing to match it with until Mr Papara committed the offences that I have earlier described, later on that year.

10The offence of aggravated break enter and commit affray in company has a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. It has a standard non-parole period of five years. Those matters are enough to demonstrate the seriousness with which Parliament said such offences should be treated. I suspect Mr Papara does not realise the severity of his misconduct and he should be under no misapprehension the legislation says that an important guidepost in determining his sentence is a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment. I will take both the head sentence and the standard non-parole period into account in determining this sentence in this case. My reasons for not imposing a standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.

11As well, there is a the well-known authority which says sentences other than of imprisonment for offences carrying standard non-parole periods should be uncommon. The starting point thus in this case is that Mr Papara should go to gaol given what he has done.

12He was 18, just 18 at the time of this offence and so not a man of the maturity that an adult might have. Until he left school his stepfather, who gave evidence today, described him as a good kid, someone who his mother and stepfather were entitled to be proud of. The attitude to alcohol displayed by his mother and stepfather appears to have been very sensible, no alcohol was served at home and certainly this was not a household where parents encouraged drinking. Despite this, and somewhat to his stepfather's surprise, Mr Papara told the author of the pre-sentence report that he had been binge drinking on weekends since he was 15 years of age. His stepfather knew nothing of this until he read it in the pre-sentence report. So although his offending, the commission of criminal offences, has been recent his misbehaviour has not been. 

13Mr Leary did not suggest that the offender has expressed his remorse for his wrongdoing. As his stepfather explained Mr Papara said that he was embarrassed and he apologised to his parents. That is very different for being sorry for having done the wrong thing. I heard no expression of remorse in those terms in these proceedings.

14Perhaps the most important thing that can be said in Mr Papara's favour is that he has apparently changed his attitude in more recent times. He is no longer associating with the people he was associating with when he committed this offence. He has made new friends. He has started working part time with his stepfather. There is thus hope for the offender's future, but I would not want anyone to think that Mr Papara was out of the woods yet. That he has embarked on a series of serious offences, including one carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, suggests that there is a considerable way to go before it can be said that he is unlikely to commit further offences in the future.

15Mr Leary submitted that this was an offence at the lower end of the scale. It must be remembered that most offences of aggravated break and enter and commit indictable offence in company involve the indictable offence of stealing. That is, stealing is usually much less serious than this offence of affray where violence, and considerable violence, was used. 

16Mr Leary began by submitting that Community Service was appropriate. That does have some attractions, requiring that Mr Papara perform what would have been a large number of hours of service to the community, but I am satisfied the circumstances of this offence require a sentence of imprisonment. A Community Service Order does not adequately reflect the objective gravity of the offender's conduct.

17What form should that imprisonment take? Mr Leary suggested a suspended sentence of imprisonment. Here it is important to look at what that would involve for Mr Papara. If he completes the bond and complies with its conditions he would receive no effective punishment at all. So having assaulted a policeman in Queensland, having been involved with an offence where he was armed with a knife and another affray whilst drunk, and having committed the offence for which I am about to sentence him his effective punishment would be the fine of $700 he was made to pay for the Queensland offence. That would, I am satisfied, send completely the wrong message to Mr Papara. It would encourage him to think that he can continue to do what he is doing and effectively get away with it. It would also send the wrong message to others in Mr Papara's situation. As I noted at the very beginning of these remarks on sentences offences of this type are too common. Anyone like Mr Papara who in the future thinks that they will go out and get drunk, break into some premises and then assault people inside must learn that serious punishment follows.

18I have determined the length of the sentence that should be imposed upon Mr Papara. I am satisfied that it is likely that it will be a sentence of less than two years. In my view the appropriate sentence, should Mr Papara be eligible for it, is an Intensive Corrections Order.

19I will refer Mr Papara for assessment into his suitability to serve the sentence of imprisonment I will impose upon him through that means.

20So his bail is continued on the current conditions, in addition.


He is to live at XXXX with his mother. 
He is to report to the city office of Probation and Parole Service within seven days. 

21Mr Papara, you are not out of the woods yet. If you are suitable for an Intensive Corrections Order it is likely you won't go to gaol, but if you are not suitable it's likely that you will go to gaol. So that means you've got to cooperate with the Probation and Parole Service. One thing they will be concerned about is your conduct if you drink. You are going to have to satisfy them that you can stay out of trouble, because if you do not satisfy them that you are suitable to do this sentence by means of an Intensive Corrections Order you will probably go to gaol. Do you understand that?

		31 July 2014",2014-05-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2421993,R v SK R v DK [2014] NSWSC 816,"Judgment
1HER HONOUR:  Before the Court are two release applications under s 49 of the Bail Act 2013.  The applications have been heard together, since the applicants are twins.  They are both now aged 15.
2In determining the application, the Court must have regard to the presumption of innocence and the general right to be at liberty.  
3The first issue to be determined is whether either applicant presents an unacceptable risk of the kind identified in s 17 of the Bail Act.  Those risks are the risk of failure to appear, the commission of a serious offence, endangering the safety of victims, individuals or the community or interference with witnesses or evidence.  The Crown submits in each case that there is a risk of the commission of a serious offence and risk to the safety of the victim or individuals or the broader community.  The Crown does not suggest any risk of failure to appear.
4The material before the Court tendered by the Crown amply sustains that conclusion.  The more difficult task in determining the present applications is the second question posed by the Bail Act, which is whether the risk identified by the Court can be sufficiently mitigated by the imposition of bail conditions.
5The present applicants present a difficult series of considerations in respect of that issue.  The applicant DK pleaded guilty to a charge of common assault and stealing from a person, which are the charges representing the first group of offences in respect of which bail is sought.  He is due to be sentenced in respect of those offences on 25 June 2014.
6As a result of his having pleaded guilty there is before me a detailed report prepared by Juvenile Justice in respect of him.  Since SK is his twin, much of the background recited in that report is of plain relevance to SK's application as well.
7The report recites a troubled background which goes a considerable way to explaining the criminal history and the current charges against the two boys.  They were removed from their parents when they were not much older than one year due to instances of domestic violence and substance abuse.  They spent considerable time with different foster carers until 2003 when they returned to live with their father and his new partner.
8Further difficulties however were experienced and they were subsequently again removed from the care of their father and placed with foster parents.  They were subsequently placed with a paternal aunt and uncle where unfortunately both physical and emotional abuse and neglect continued.
9Presently, or at least until their arrest, they had an entitlement to reside at Gordon House, a Burnside facility operated by the Uniting Church.  There they fell under the care of a social worker, Mr Jonathon Denton, who has provided a report to the Court in each case proposing conditions which would seek to mitigate the risk of future offending.
10The question as to what conditions are required sufficiently to mitigate an unacceptable risk such as to warrant a grant of bail is an evaluative judgment which must necessarily be informed by the nature of the risk assessed by the Court.
11Section 17 of the Bail Act makes it plain that Parliament intended that the assessment be very much focused on the individual circumstances of each case coming before the court and, further, that the assessment be informed not only by considerations of the protection of the community but also by considerations relating to the circumstances of the applicant.
12That is made plain by the inclusion of s 17(3)(j), which requires the court in assessing whether there is ""unacceptable"" risk to have regard to any special vulnerability of the accused person.
13The present applicants plainly are boys of acute vulnerability by reason of their youth and the circumstances of their background to which I have referred.  Further, the Juvenile Justice report reveals that they have recently suffered the death of their sister, who was also living at Gordon House, apparently due to a drug overdose.
14Those considerations lead to competing conclusions.  On the one hand, they might be regarded as factors exacerbating the risk of offending; on the other they highlight the acute need for these boys to fall under the care of a considered and carefully planned proposal to meet their future needs, which will mitigate the risk of future offending.
15Neither the prospect of refusing bail nor the prospect of releasing them from custody is entirely satisfactory or entirely risk-free.  The Bail Act does not contemplate the absence of any risk if a person is released, but the informed balancing of risk.
16With some hesitation I have concluded that the applicants should be released on bail on conditions which reflect the careful plan proposed on behalf of each of them with the input of Juvenile Justice and Mr Denton.
17On balance I am satisfied that the conditions proposed sufficiently mitigate the risk I have identified of future offending.  I have not recited the detail of the matters with which they are charged but have had careful regard to the content of that material in reaching this conclusion.

		21 July 2014",2014-05-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2422043,Elliott v Tomkins (No. 3) [2014] NSWDC 68,"Judgment

1This is an application by the defendant to strike out the plaintiff's claim for defamation arising from six Internet publications published between 21 and 23 August 2012. The subject matter consists of a negative Ebay review and subsequent discussion of the products purchased by the defendant from a business named ""Achilles Archery & Outdoors"" on the Australian Bowhunting Forum website. 

2The plaintiff was not named in five of the six publications. A letter signed ""David Elliott"" appears as part of the fourth matter complained of, but the statement of claim provided no particulars of identification for any of the publications (Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG (1985) 1 NSWLR 188), or of their publication in Australia. The only reference to publication is to ""the global Internet accessibility"" of the Internet. Publication occurs in the place where the publication is downloaded, and must be pleaded on this basis: Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575 at [25]-[28] and [44]. 

3The defendant, at that time a litigant in person, filed a defence attempting to plead justification, but the pleadings failed to conform with Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR"") Pt 14 Division 4. The plaintiff brought an application for summary judgment and assessment of damages, which was listed for hearing to 30 January 2014. On 30 January 2014 the defendant (appearing by telephone link from Western Australia) outlined the difficulties he had encountered in retaining a solicitor, and sought an extension of time to file a defence in proper form, which was granted. 

4On 28 February 2014, Mr Goldsmith appeared for the defendant, but said that an amended defence could not be filed because of the deficiencies in the statement of claim. He tendered correspondence to the solicitors for the plaintiff in which he had set out his requests for particulars of identification and publication to be provided, as well as information about the connecting factors with New South Wales (the plaintiff being resident in Queensland), and foreshadowing an application for summary dismissal if the failure to provide proper particulars was not remedied. 

5The proceedings were stood over to 28 March 2014, and then to 9 April 2014. The particulars of identification and place of publication were not provided. On 9 April 2014, after hearing argument, I made the following orders:

(1)Extend the time for the filing of a Further Amended Statement of Claim to Wednesday 14 May 2014 conditional upon the plaintiff paying the defendant's costs of and incidental to 28 February 2014, 28 March 2014 and today on an indemnity basis, assessable forthwith.

(2)Order (1) is self-executing in nature.

(3)The notice of motion stood over part heard to Monday 26 May 2014 at 9:30am before Gibson DCJ.

6As was the case with the previous orders (see Elliott v Tomkins [2014] NSWDC 55 and Elliott v Tomkins (No. 2) [2014] NSWDC 56) the plaintiff failed to comply, and the defendant has renewed his application for the proceedings to be dismissed with costs. 

7When the proceedings came before me today, there was no appearance on the part of the plaintiff. A Notice of Intention to File Notice of Ceasing to Act (filed 28 April 2014) and a Notice of Ceasing to Act (filed 13 May 2014) had been filed. The particulars the defendant sought remain outstanding despite the self-executing order.

8The fact that a self-executing order has been made does not necessarily result in an order for judgment in the proceedings in favour of the opposing party: Douglas v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd [1983] 3 NSWLR 126 per Hunt J at 134-135. However, the repeated failures of the plaintiff to provide the particulars of identification, which are ""of vital importance to a defendant in almost every defamation action"" (Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG, supra, at 192), mean that the plaintiff must therefore ""suffer the loss of his action"" (Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG, supra, at 194). Particulars of the place of publication are just as important, as the defence to the action must be pleaded in accordance with the law of the place of the tort: Strang Aniokaka Ltd v Lihir Gold Ltd (No 2) [2010] FCA 1065 at [88], citing Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick, supra, at [40] - [44]. 

9While summary judgment applications should not be granted other than in the clearest of cases, the plaintiff's repeated failure to provide such essential requirements makes the further conduct of this litigation impossible. In such circumstances, the defendant is entitled to the relief sought.

10Claims for defamation are easy to commence, and difficult to defend. More than any other cause of action, claims for defamation have long been regarded as giving rise to the potential for abuse of process, and these concerns are reflected in the legislative framework in which such claims are brought. The repealed Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) contained a series of provisions designed to avoid protracted litigation (ss 3(d) and 9(3)), multiple proceedings (ss 9(3) and 48) and other potentially oppressive claims (s 9(6)(b)). The New South Wales Law Reform Commission, Defamation, Report No. 11 (1971)), when drafting this legislation, set out in detail the need to prevent misuse of this cause of action. The intention of the current, as well as the repealed, legislation, has been to ensure that the complexity and expense of defamation proceedings should be subject to scrutiny by the court, as the Court of Appeal noted in Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corp [2008] NSWCA 37. The Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), when read in conjunction with ss 56-62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and Part 15 Div 4 UCPR, requires parties to plead and particularise their claims and defences with precision, as specialist lists for defamation are available in both the Supreme Court and District Court.

11It has been an increasingly common feature of defamation actions over the past decade that the defendant is a litigant in person (see Tobin & Sexton, Australian Defamation Law & Practice (LexisNexis) at [60,590]). Courts must exercise care that pleading errors and difficulties are resolved as early as possible in the litigation, which can create case management problems where one or more of the parties is a litigant in person, for the reasons explained by McCallum J in Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc v Judge [2013] NSWSC 1783 and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc v Judge (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1821. However, where a party is legally represented, the court is entitled to expect that the pleadings and particulars will be supplied when ordered. 

12In practical terms, the provision of the particulars of identification and publication sought by the defendant was a straightforward request for simple particulars of information of the kind that were essential to the plaintiff's claim. The reasons for the plaintiff's failure to provide such particulars, particularly given the foreshadowed application to amend the claim to bring a claim for special damages (which would require the disclosure of the identity of the parties refusing to deal with the plaintiff, and their geographical location), remain unexplained.

13The defendant in these proceedings was at a particular disadvantage when the plaintiff brought his application to strike out the defence. He works in a remote part of Western Australia, and locating a solicitor sufficiently conversant with defamation proceedings to represent him in New South Wales was not an easy task, he told the court on 30 January, when the plaintiff was seeking summary judgment against him. What would have occurred if he had not been able to locate a solicitor who was familiar with defamation law and could raise the defects in the plaintiff's claim is difficult to determine. The degree to which courts can assist litigants in person in such circumstances is an issue of controversy, as McCallum J's two judgments in the Sporting Shooters proceedings underline.

14The distress caused to ordinary members of the community who find themselves at the receiving end of proceedings for defamation (as opposed to experienced media defendants) has been the subject of comment both by Hunt J in Hanrahan v Ainsworth (1985) 1 NSWLR 370 at 377 - 8 and Levine J in Cumberland v Clark (1996) 39 NSWLR 514 at 529. Hunt J, referring to a defamation claim brought against a police officer by a person he had been about to arrest, stated:

""Anyone who has had to act for personal defendants (even where any damages to be awarded are to be paid by their employers) will recognise the impact which the defamation proceedings against them personally make upon such defendants.""

15These considerations are even more relevant today, where parties with no prior experience of defamation law, rather than experienced media defendants, increasingly find themselves before the court in complex and expensive litigation.

16I accordingly enter judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff is to pay the defendant's costs of the proceedings in accordance with order (2)(b). 

Orders

(1)Plaintiff called outside Court 13D three times at 9:36am - no appearance.

(2)Defendant's application for summary dismissal of the statement of claim with costs, stood over part-heard to today, is granted, and orders made as follows:

(a)Judgment for the defendant.

(b)Plaintiff pay defendant's costs of the proceedings on a party/party basis (other than the costs covered by my orders of 9 April 2014).

		18 June 2014",2014-05-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2422379,R v Hunter (No 9) [2014] NSWSC 1152,"Judgment
1Objection has been taken by defence counsel to the receipt into evidence of two photographs. They are photographs 46 and 78 of the series of photographs that became voir dire exhibit S. All of the photographs were taken of the body of the deceased at post-mortem. Defence counsel relies upon the well-known ""discretion"" in s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). 
2To state the background with succinctness, the Crown alleges that the accused and either his brother, his first cousin, or both, fatally assaulted the deceased on the evening of 20 June 2011 in retaliation for an assault that the deceased had inflicted upon the accused earlier that day. The Crown case is that the accused was either the principal in the first degree who assaulted the deceased with intent to inflict, at least, really serious physical injury and thereby caused his death, or was present at the scene and part of a joint criminal enterprise to inflict, at least, really serious physical injury upon the deceased. 
3In his opening, defence counsel informed the jury that the question of causation is not in dispute, although he did refer to a medical condition from which the deceased suffered that caused his blood not to coagulate normally. Defence counsel did not state that there was no dispute that any principal in the first degree possessed an intention to inflict really serious physical injury, and in discussion in support of this application he made it clear that that matter is not conceded. 
4Defence counsel drew attention to the second report of Professor Duflou, which became voir dire exhibit Z. In the second paragraph on page 2 of that report, the Professor said ""The bruising around the eyes is very likely secondary to the other injuries sustained, and does not indicate blows to the eyes (so-called black eyes)."" In other words, defence counsel submitted, the state of the area around the eyes of the deceased shown in voir dire exhibit S 46 does not inform the tribunal of fact about the number and force of blows inflicted upon the deceased. He submitted that the photograph could be cropped so as to show nothing more than the semi-circular wound to the forehead of the deceased, and so that it would not show the bruising to the area of the eyes of the deceased and the blood seemingly emanating from one of his nostrils. 
5As for voir dire exhibit S 78, he submitted that the large wound to the rear of the head of the deceased can just as easily be expressed in words with regard to its length, breadth, position, freshness and so forth, and that the photograph is unnecessarily distressing. 
6The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the photos are, as post-mortem photographs always must be in a murder trial, not lacking in a degree of emotive force. But she submitted that, in light of the issues in the trial, the test in the section has not been made out on the application.
7A number of aspects of the trial lead me to accept the proposition of the Crown Prosecutor. 
8First, at the start of the trial the Crown Prosecutor indicated to the jury panel that graphic photographs would be presented during the evidence. Thereafter, I invited members of the jury panel to reflect upon whether they were capable of sitting as an impartial judge of the facts. None of the serving jurors sought to be excused on that basis. 
9Secondly, in light of the fact that it is not conceded that the principal or principals in the first degree assault the deceased with intent to inflict really serious physical injury, the details of the injuries actually inflicted to the person of the deceased are an important part of the Crown case with regard to an issue in dispute between the parties. 
10Thirdly, although the photograph that constitutes voir dire exhibit S 78 shows a severe wound to the rear of the head of a fellow human being, the wound is sutured and not gaping. 
11Fourthly, I accept that voir dire exhibit S 46 is distressing, in that it shows the face of the deceased, thereby personalising the image. But to my mind the most distressing aspect of it is the large sutured wound to the forehead of the deceased, and not the bruising to the area of his eyes and the small amount of blood that has seemingly emanated from his nostril. 
12It would be difficult indeed to describe accurately in words the precise parameters, shape and other attributes of that bruising; and, in any event, to the extent that the Professor has spoken of that bruising as being ""secondary"", it is not completely clear that he meant by that that the injuries to the area of the eyes of the deceased are irrelevant to the task of determining the force of the blows inflicted upon this person. 
13In short, I regard the probative value of both photographs as reasonably high. Although I consider that there is a danger of unfair prejudice arising from the admission of the two photographs, I am not satisfied that that danger outweighs the probative value of the two exhibits. 
14Accordingly, the section is not engaged, and the two photographs will be admitted into evidence.

		21 August 2014",2014-07-10 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2422396,Jianwei Liu v State of New South Wales [2014] NSWSC 933,"Judgment

1In these proceedings the plaintiff claims damages from the defendant for the loss of items of personal property confiscated by police officers and later destroyed whilst held in the custody of the New South Wales Police Force. The circumstances of destruction were not explained.

2On 1 April 2011 the plaintiff was arrested and items of property were seized, taken to, and held at, a local police station. The property consisted of a Cartier watch, a white gold necklace, a jade pendant, a Louis Vuitton belt, shoes, and Mercedes Benz car keys. The property was destroyed on or about 21 August 2011.

3It was common ground that these items were unrelated to an offence, and ought not to have been destroyed. The defendant accepts liability to compensate the plaintiff for the loss of his property. 

4During the hearing there was agreement as to the value of the following items:

Cartier watch: $13,300
Louis Vuitton belt: $565
Shoes: $750
Mercedes Benz car keys: $500

5The only issue for trial was the assessment of damages for the loss of the necklace and pendant, and whether it should include an amount for compensation for sentimental value of those items.

The Evidence

6An account of the history of the plaintiff's ownership of the pendant and necklace, and a description of these items, were given by the plaintiff and his father, Mr Bing Wen Liu. The following is a summary of the relevant evidence, which I accept.

7The plaintiff was born in China on 5 June 1970. He migrated to Australia on 2 July 2001 to join his parents and sister. When the plaintiff was 20 years old the pendant was given to him by his father to whom it had been given by the plaintiff's grandfather prior to 1945.

8In about 2007 the plaintiff entrusted the pendant to a friend, Ying Han, for inclusion in an exhibition of jade in Beijing. The plaintiff received a certificate which recorded the description of some features of the pendant. The document was headed ""Testing Results"" and, purportedly, was issued by the ""National Gold & Diamond Testing Centre"". Before it was returned to the plaintiff there were attached to the pendant a single white gold ring of approximately 0.4-0.5 centimetres in diameter, and two white gold rings of approximately 0.5-0.6 centimetres in diameter to the single white gold ring. Subsequently the plaintiff attached a white gold necklace (the necklace) to the two white gold rings which had been attached to the pendant.

9Both the plaintiff and his father described the pendant in terms which were substantially similar, based on their observations of the item. Relevantly, the plaintiff said (affidavit 7 May 2013, para 11):

""11. I am thoroughly familiar with the jade pendant and describe the jade pendant as follows:

a. The jade pendant is transparent with hints of different shades of green on it.

b. The areas with different shades of green are still transparent, except for a small area with dark green colour near the corner of the jade pendant.

c. I named the jade pendant ""(Chinese characters)"" in Mandarin which translates to ""floating green on a bed of ice"" due to the transparency of the jade pendant and its different shades of green.

d. The jade pendant is oval in shape with a relatively wider and rounder bottom compared to its top part.

e. The entire piece of the jade pendant is approximately 5 centimetres in length and 3 centimetres in width.

f. The jade pendant has carvings of a Pixiu in a lying down position, a Ruyi, coins and flowers on it and the carvings on the jade pendant protrude outwards.

g. A Pixiu is a magical beast in Chinese mythology with a dragon's head, a horse's body, a qilin's feet and the overall shape of a lion. We Chinese believe that it brings good luck and wards off evil.

h. A Ruyi is a short sword with a sword-guard and is usually shown to be held by the Chinese Gods for self-defence or gesturing.

i. The jade pendant has the same shades of green distributed on both the front and back of the pendant and is carved with exactly the same carvings on both the front and back of the pendant.

j. On the side of the jade pendant where the dark green area is on the bottom right of the pendant, the Pixiu is carved on the center left side near to the edge and the Ruyi is carved at the center right side near to the edge, whereby parts of the Ruyi is covered in a dark green shade. Some coins and flowers are also carved throughout the jade pendant.

k. The thickness of the jade pendant, inclusive of the thickness of its carvings, is approximately 0.6 centimetres. The carvings protrude approximately 0.22 centimetres from the even surface of the jade pendant. The smooth circular edges of the jade pendant were slightly thinner than the rest of the jade pendant, being about 0.4 centimetres in thickness.

l. The jade pendant has a small hole of approximately 0.2 centimetres in diameter at the top part of the jade pendant so that a string can be tied through it to form a necklace.""

10The plaintiff said he wore the pendant and necklace continuously until it was confiscated. He cherished the pendant as a family heirloom.

11As to the issue of valuation of the pendant and the necklace, the difficulty which confronted the parties was that the items no longer existed. The only available information for consideration by an expert consisted of a photograph of the pendant and necklace taken by police on 1 April 2011, the certificate, and the description given by the plaintiff.

12The plaintiff claimed these items, particularly the pendant, were of substantial value. However, no evidence was adduced by the plaintiff as to the value of either. Ms Karrina Chen, the plaintiff's solicitor, deposed to numerous unsuccessful efforts between February 2012 and early 2014 to locate an appropriate expert to provide a valuation report for these proceedings. In evidence were letters of 14 December 2013 and 24 March 2014 to Ms Chen from Catherine Ricketts, an expert valuer, who declined to provide a valuation of the pendant. Her letter of 14 December 2013 included:

""Regarding your request to value a 'Jade pendant', I am unable to make an accurate valuation based on a photograph and worded description.

The nature of this piece requires physical inspection, without this any valuation would be simple speculation.

Physical inspection would inform towards craftsmanship and quality of the stone. It is of my professional option that macroscopic hardness and Gemmological testing is essential to determine the value of this jade pendant.""

13For the valuation of the pendant the defendant relied upon the reports of Mr Warren Joel, who has about 35 years experience as an auctioneer and specialist valuer and, inter alia, is approved to value a wide range of objects for the Australian Government's Cultural Gifts Program, including Chinese, Japanese, east and south-east Asian jade after 1800. The plaintiff accepted his general expertise.

14In his report of 18 November 2013, Mr Joel noted the lack of information as to age, type, carving, origin and condition, being factors relevant to the valuation of a particular jade piece. He explained that there are many different types of jade including jadeite, nephrite jade and jade, within each of which there are varieties of colours and combinations of colours. He noted the absence of detail about the pendant itself regarding age, authenticity, rarity, value or general collectibility. His estimation of the valuation range was expressed as follows:

""Without the supporting evidence as to age, type of Jade, origin and condition I can find no precedent for this type of item selling for more than one thousand dollars, at the most. If I look at the photo of the pendant that is the subject of this case and any of the pendants selling for more than $5,000 or even $10,000 there is a fundamental difference in the overall appearance. The missing pendant would appear to be more of what I would consider a 20th century copy.""

15In his report of 3 April 2014, Mr Joel said:

""1(B) Reasons why I maintain my original valuation of the missing pendant.

I. As discussed in my report there are many factors that contribute to the value of the jade, and to achieve a higher value all of the elements must be present in the one item. These include colour and translucency. The missing pendant is lacking both these elements.

II. I still maintain that, in my opinion the missing pendant looks like a piece of cheap 'tourist' jade, and as such could not be worth more than the $5,000-$10,000 at the most.""

16Mr Joel said he proceeded on the basis that the pendant was jade as described in the translation of the certificate provided to him. He observed that the item in the photograph in the certificate appeared to be the same as that shown in the police photograph, and considered that the plaintiff's description was consistent with the item as depicted in the police photograph. He accepted that on the limited information available his opinion necessarily had a speculative element, as in any valuation. Although cross-examined at some length, he adhered to his estimate of value. In my opinion, his estimate was not undermined. I accept it as a reliable guide for the purpose of the assessment I am required to make. 

17During the hearing, and for the first time, an issue arose in respect of the correct translation of an entry in the certificate. The question was whether the Mandarin characters opposite the word ""Conclusion"" meant ""jade"" or ""jadeite"". Experts in Mandarin, Mr Wang, and Ms Lum, gave evidence of meanings. Mr Wang, for the plaintiff, said that the characters meant ""jadeite"", but accepted the meaning ""jade"" was open. Ms Lum, for the defendant, understood the characters meant ""jade"", which she said was a generic term which could refer to different types of jade. In the English version of the certificate seen by Mr Joel the pendant was described as ""jade"".

18The conclusion I draw from their evidence is that it was open to the reader to understand the characters to mean either ""jade"" or ""jadeite"". In my opinion it is unnecessary to resolve any difference as to meaning for the purpose of assessing the value of the pendant. From the outset, the plaintiff and his father described the pendant as ""jade"", and the case proceeded on the basis that such description was appropriate. Mr Joel based his valuation on the assumption the pendant was jade having regard to the translation of the certificate provided to him. However, he said that knowledge that the pendant was jadeite would not have caused him to alter his valuation. 



The Principles 

19With regard to the assessment of damages where quantification is difficult guidance is afforded by the authorities. It is sufficient to refer to the following.

20In Armory v Delamirie (1722) 1 Strange 505; [1722] EWHC KB J94 it was held that in the circumstances of that case the jury could presume the strongest case against the defendant and make the value of the best jewels the measure of the damages.

21In State of New South Wales v Moss (2000) 54 NSWLR 536 Heydon JA said:

""[72] Thirdly, the mere fact that the quantum of damages is difficult to assess does not mean that the plaintiff is only entitled to a nominal sum. This principle applies as much to the assessment of damages for impaired earning capacity in injured plaintiffs as it does to pecuniary loss caused by negligent advice (Bowen v Blair [1933] VLR 398) or to loss in the form of the diminished value of damaged property (Wheeler v Riverside Coal Transport Co Pty Ltd [1964] Qd R 113), or equitable damages (Talbot v General Television Corp Pty Ltd [1980] VR 224 at 250-1), or damages for breach of contract (Fink v Fink (1946) 74 CLR 127 at 143). In the last case, Dixon and McTiernan JJ put the following general proposition: ""Where there has been an actual loss of some sort, the common law does not permit difficulties of estimating the loss in money to defeat the only remedy it provided for breach of contract, an award of damages."" This was followed in Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL (1994) 185 CLR 332 at 349 per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ. The same is true in tort. In Naylor v Yorkshire Electricity Board [1968] AC 529 at 548 Lord Devlin said: ""in the law of damages ... difficulty in calculation is not ordinarily taken as a ground either for reducing or for increasing the award"". The court will be more ready to shoulder the burden of acting without specific evidence where that evidence is difficult to call. In Biggin & Co Ltd v Permanite Ltd [1951] 1 KB 422 at 438, a sale of goods case involving a recovery in respect of damaged goods, Devlin J said: ""It is only that where precise evidence is obtainable the Court naturally expects to have it. Where it is not the Court must do the best it can"". As McPherson J said in Nilon v Bezzina [1988] 2 Qd R 420 at 424: ""The degree of precision with which damages are to be proved is proportionate to the proof reasonably available"". The courts on occasion cite in related contexts Bowen LJ's related but stricter observation in Ratcliffe v Evans [1892] 2 QB 524 at 532-523, an injurious falsehood case:

'In all actions ... on the case where the damage actually done is the gist of the action, the character of the acts themselves which produce the damage, and the circumstances under which these acts are done, must regulate the degree of certainty and particularity with which the damage done ought to be stated and proved. As much certainty and particularity must be insisted on ... in ... proof of damage, as is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances and the nature of the acts themselves by which the damage is done.'""

22In McCartny & Ors v Orica Investments Pty Ltd [2011] NSWCA 337 Giles JA said:

""[158] Such a course is not a substitute for proof of loss, or an invitation to punishment rather than compensation. It need not be taken, but may be; many assessments of future economic loss from impairment of earning capacity, for example, involve uncertainty, but an approach of resolving the uncertainty against the wrongdoer is generally not taken. Where within the proved case there is a range, however, the wrongdoer can hardly complain if the loss is found at the upper end of the range.

[159] L J P Investments Pty Ltd v Howard Chia Investments Pty Ltd (No 2) and Houghton v Immer (No 155) Pty Ltd were distinguished by Rolfe J in Lavender View Pty Ltd v North Sydney Council [1999] NSWSC 255 ; (1999) 104 LGERA 255. His Honour regarded Armory v Delamirie as a different case from the case before him, and did not think that any conduct on the defendant's part had caused the plaintiff difficulty in quantifying its damages; he applied the ""the fundamental proposition that the onus is on the plaintiff ... to prove the amount of damages"" (at [23]). A robust approach against a defendant whose wrongdoing has required the plaintiff to prove its damages, where proof of the damages involves uncertainty, is not inconsistent with that proposition. Indeed, the proposition does not always hold good, see the particular situation of a claim for reliance loss caused by breach of contract described by Hodgson JA (Allsop P and Macfarlan JA agreeing) in Macquarie International Health Clinic Pty Ltd v Sydney South West Area Health Service [2010] NSWCA 268; (2010) 15 BPR 28,563 at [163]-

In those cases where it is not possible for a plaintiff to prove whether or to what extent performance of a contract would have been profitable, it can seek to recover expenses reasonably incurred and wasted on the contract, albeit that it cannot recover more than would have been recovered by performance of the contract. However, in those cases where a contract has been rescinded for breach, making it impossible for the plaintiff to prove that it would have recovered those expenses from performance of the contract, the onus shifts to the defendant to prove that it would not have done so: Commonwealth v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 54; (1991) 174 CLR 64.""

and Young JA said:

""[218] Putting all these thoughts together, it would seem that the tag ""Armory v Delamirie"" has been attached to a number of similar though possibly distinct principles. First, in cases where there is an action in tort relating to chattels, if the defendant who was last seen in possession of the chattel does not produce it, the court can assume it is the most valuable chattel of the type. Secondly, in actions in debt where no wrongdoing is attributable to the defendant, the plaintiff must prove its case and, if it shows that there is some damage, but cannot prove quantum, the smallest amount is allowed. Thirdly, where the plaintiff is entitled to damages and compensation and their computation is made more difficult by the defendant's action, then the court may assume the worst against the defendant consistent with the evidence. Fourthly, in cases such as those dealt with in Commonwealth v Amann Aviation, the defendant has the ultimate onus of proving that, had the contract been performed, the net value of the plaintiff's benefits would not have covered the expenditure incurred before rescission.""

23In Rockdale City Council v Micro Developments Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 128 Giles JA said:

""[66] ...The task was to arrive at what could only be an estimate of Micro's loss. In any case where precision is not possible or not realistic the court must arrive at the loss despite the difficulty of doing so, including when the loss is from breach of contract (Fink v Fink (1946) 74 CLR 127) or from negligent advice (Bowen v Blair (1933) VLR 398): see generally State of New South Wales v Moss [2000] NSWCA 133, (2000) NSWCA 133, (2000) 54 NSWLR 536 in the reasons of Heydon JA.""


Consideration

24The plaintiff candidly declined to propose an amount as the reasonable value for either the pendant or the necklace. The Court was urged to adopt a robust approach favourable to the plaintiff to arrive at an amount in excess of Mr Joel's upper estimate, it being reasonable to take a generous view in circumstances where the defendant's wrongdoing had made quantification difficult. In effect, it was put that it was open to find that Mr Joel had downplayed his assessment, having come to the view that the piece was merely ""tourist jade"", whereas the Court should make an assessment based on the assumption that the pendant was jadeite, and probably of greater value than jade.

25For the defendant it was fairly conceded that it was open to value the pendant at the high end of Mr Joel's range. It was put that, in the circumstances, there being no evidence to support a finding that the pendant was jadeite, the Court should make an assessment on the basis that, in fact, it was jade.

26It was common ground that there was no evidence of the value of the white gold chain or necklace. The defendant submitted that the plaintiff had failed to prove the value of this loss and, accordingly, the Court was left without the basis upon which any assessment could be made.

27In deference to the plaintiff's submissions, I keep in mind that the task of assessment is very different in this case from the assessment, for example, of damages for diminished earning capacity which has been said to sometimes involve ""guess work rather than estimation"" (Jones v Schiffman (1971) 124 CLR 303 at 308 per Menzies J). 

28In the State of New South Wales v Moss Heydon JA (para 72) referred to authorities which demonstrate that difficulty in quantification of the loss claimed should not prevent the assessment of an appropriate award of damages for a loss, and that ""The Court will be more ready to shoulder the burden of acting without specific evidence where that evidence is difficult to call"". His Honour also referred to Biggin & Co Ltd v Permanite Limited (1951) 1 KB 422 at 438 in which Devlin J said ""It is only that where precise evidence is obtainable the Court naturally expects to have it. Where it is not the Court must do the best it can"". Thus, where there is a want of specific evidence, the Court is required to do the best it can with the materials before it to assess damages. As in every case, the Court is confined by the evidence. In a case such as the present, as explained by Giles JA in McCartney & Ors v Orica Investments Pty Ltd (paras 158, 159) the fundamental proposition remains that the onus is on the plaintiff to prove the amount of damages although ""...Where within the proved case there is a range...the wrongdoer can hardly complain if the loss is found at the upper end of the range"". In the same case, Young JA (para 218) held ""...where the plaintiff is entitled to damages and compensation and their computation is made more difficult by the defendant's action, then the court may assume the worst against the defendant consistent with the evidence"".

29In the present case, of course, the only evidence of value of the pendant was adduced by the defendant. It was uncontradicted. Mr Joel's expertise enabled him to value the pendant within a wide range, taking into account the lack of information in relation to various relevant factors and, I infer, also the uncertainty resulting from such lack of information. In my opinion, the fact that the plaintiff was unable to obtain similar evidence does not justify the Court in departing from the evidence before it, or to make an assessment not consistent with it. Nevertheless, as the defendant properly acknowledged, in the circumstances it is open to find the loss at the upper end of the range.

30In my opinion, the destruction of the pendant whilst it was in the hands of the police justifies the Court in assuming the worst against the defendant consistent with the evidence. Accordingly, I assess the value of the loss of the jade pendant in the amount of $10,000.

31Absent evidence relevant to the value of the necklace, the Court was left with no rational or principled basis upon which to make an assessment. It follows that the plaintiff's claim for an award of damages for this item must be rejected. 

32Also claimed as a component of general damages in compensation for the loss of the pendant was an amount for its sentimental value to the plaintiff. No particulars of the claim were pleaded, and no submissions in support of it were made until very late in the day, although it had been faintly flagged earlier (Tp28). This unsatisfactory situation was remedied by providing the parties opportunity to provide written submissions on the issue.

33The claim is to be assessed with regard to the personal or emotional value of the piece to the plaintiff, as distinct from its objective or intrinsic value. It is now settled that the scope of general damages payable in cases of the present kind is not confined to economic loss or market value, but may include an amount for non-pecuniary loss (Graham v Voigt (1989) 95 FLR 146; Ichard v Frangoulis (1977) 1 WLR 556; Murphy v Doman [2004] NSWCA 419; Palmer on Bailment, 3rd edition, paras 37-025, 37-017).

34The plaintiff's evidence, which I accept, was that the pendant was of significant meaning to him. He regarded it as a family heirloom which had been handed down through his grandfather and father. It was given to him when he was about 20 years old, and he had worn it everyday since about 2005. I am satisfied that the pendant had real sentimental value for the plaintiff, and I infer that its loss and destruction would have been deeply felt. Furthermore, in my opinion, it was reasonably foreseeable that the pendant was a possession of sentimental value to the plaintiff.

35Mindful that damages are compensatory, an assessment is necessarily a matter of impression as to which there are no clear standards which can be applied (Murphy para 4). Quantification should be modest (Farley v Skinner (2002) 2 AC 732 p 748). In my opinion the appropriate amount for sentimental value is $2,500.

Conclusion

36The plaintiff is entitled to an award of general damages referrable to the value of the items, other than the necklace, in the total amount of $ 25,115, to be increased by the amount of $2,500 referrable to sentimental value. I propose to award damages to the plaintiff in the total amount of $27,615, with judgment accordingly.

37The parties are directed to bring in short minutes to give effect to this conclusion. As the questions of interest and costs remain outstanding, absent agreement, the parties should have the opportunity to make submissions on these issues. I should indicate that in relation to costs my prima facie view is that the defendant should be ordered to pay the plaintiff's costs on the ordinary basis. The parties are directed to arrange with my Associate by 4pm 21st July 2014 for the matter to be re-listed for the purpose of hearing any argument.

		16 July 2014",2014-07-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2422415,JC v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 228,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  I agree with Basten JA.
2BASTEN JA:  The applicants seek to set aside a judgment of the District Court dismissing their claim for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW) (""the Costs Act"").
3In December 2011 four young persons (the applicants and one other) were charged with sexual offences under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  On 19 January 2012 they appeared before the Children's Court at Parramatta.  On 31 May 2012 they were committed for a trial in the Parramatta District Court.  On 21 June 2012 they appeared before Judge Sides QC, on which occasion they were arraigned and entered pleas of not guilty to all charges.  The matter was fixed for hearing 26 November 2012.
4In late June, a ""no bill"" application was made to the Director.  On about 21 November 2012 the Director determined that the prosecution should be terminated.  When the matter came before Sides DCJ on 26 November 2012 the prosecutor advised the Court of that decision, with the result that the accused were not further arraigned before a jury panel. 
5Thereafter, the three applicants sought a certificate under the Costs Act, which would have entitled them to seek payment of their costs from consolidated revenue.  The application came before Armitage DCJ on 26 July 2013.  The application was dismissed on the basis that the Court had no jurisdiction to grant a certificate.  There is no right of appeal from such a judgment, but the applicants sought judicial review in this Court's supervisory jurisdiction, pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW).  
Issues6The case turns on the proper construction of s 2 of the Costs Act which, in November 2012, read (as it still does): 
2 Certificate may be granted
(1) The Court or Judge or Magistrate in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may:
(a) where, after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings, a defendant is acquitted or discharged in relation to the offence concerned, or a direction is given by the Director of Public Prosecutions that no further proceedings be taken, or(b) where, on appeal, the conviction of the defendant is quashed and:
(i) the defendant is discharged as to the indictment upon which he or she was convicted, or(ii) the information or complaint upon which the defendant was convicted is dismissed,
grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt, a certificate may be granted in accordance with subsection (1)(a) following an acquittal or discharge of a defendant at any time during a trial, whether a hearing on the merits of the proceedings has occurred or not.
(3) In this section, trial, in relation to proceedings, includes a special hearing conducted under section 19 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 and also includes preliminary proceedings that form part of the trial, for example, a voir dire.
7The short point raised by the present application is whether the decision by the Director that no further proceedings be taken was made ""after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings"".  
8The Director submitted that the word ""trial"" had an ordinary meaning with respect to a criminal offence tried on an indictment, namely the hearing at which a jury was empanelled and witnesses called.  That was said to accord with the common law, in the absence of any relevant statutory provision: Donaldson v State of Western Australia [2005] WASCA 196; 31 WAR 122 at [41] (Roberts-Smith JA).  However, as the cases discussed in Donaldson at [42]-[60] demonstrate, the question rarely arose under the common law, at least in modern times, but rather has involved the application of legislation.  Thus, the question has arisen with respect to legislation permitting majority verdicts, abolishing the right of an accused to give unsworn evidence and changing the rules with respect to jury directions. 
9The applicants, on the other hand, contended that a trial commenced when a person committed for trial, with respect to whom an indictment had been presented, was arraigned and pleaded not guilty.  This conclusion flowed, it was submitted, from the statutory scheme of the Costs Act, read in the context provided by the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). 
10The applicants and the Director were on common ground in two respects.  First, each accepted that the question was ultimately one of statutory construction; secondly, there was no authoritative decision of this Court (or the High Court) resolving the issue.
11The present language of the Costs Act owes much to its legislative history, in the course of which amendments have been made for specific purposes and in language which has not always been chosen with attention to the scope of the provision, but rather with an eye firmly fixed on a specific problem to be resolved.  Nevertheless, it is preferable to start with the current form of s 2 before turning to its predecessors.  Further, before turning to the elements in s 2 central for present purposes, it is convenient to identify the purpose of the overall statutory scheme.  The proper approach was recently identified in the joint reasons of Crennan, Bell, Gageler and Keane JJ in Plaintiff S297-2013 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2014] HCA 24 at [25] (albeit in relation to provisions in the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)):
""The numerous amendments that have been made to the Act form part of its legislative history and bear legitimately on its construction.  They are to be construed as part of the Act, so as to be read together 'as a combined statement of the will of the legislature'.  The timing of amendments might assist in determining the 'hierarchy' of apparently conflicting provisions of the Act as amended, but notions of 'implied repeal' have no place.""
The statutory scheme12There are provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act which allow for an award of costs in criminal proceedings.  Such orders are made against the unsuccessful party.  The grant of a certificate under the Costs Act is different: it involves the expression of an opinion by a judge or magistrate, on the basis of which the Director-General may, on application, make a payment out of consolidated revenue with respect to costs incurred in the proceedings by the party to whom the certificate was granted: s 4(1).  The opinion to be expressed in the certificate is two-fold, as provided in s 3:
3 Form of certificate
(1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Magistrate granting the certificate:
(a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and(b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.
13Turning to the language of s 2, the applicants relied on two related aspects of subss (2) and (3).  First, they noted that in subs (2) a certificate could be granted following an acquittal or discharge at any time during a trial, ""whether a hearing on the merits of the proceedings has occurred or not.""  Further, they noted that the inclusive definition of ""trial"" in subs (3) included ""preliminary proceedings that form part of the trial, for example, a voir dire.""
14In the applicants' submission, in order to comprehend the scope of this legislative scheme, it was important to note the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act which permitted ""preliminary proceedings"", such as a voir dire, to occur after the person charged was first arraigned and before a jury was empanelled.  
15For this purpose, one aspect of the general law should be noted.  In Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23 (a case involving the power of a trial court to stay proceedings for delay) Brennan J noted at 36:
""Absent any special statutory investiture, the District Court has no jurisdiction in a criminal matter prior to the presentation of an indictment.""
16As the Court of Criminal Appeal noted in KS v Veitch [2012] NSWCCA 186; 300 ALR 181 at [17], an indictment is presented by filing it with the Registrar of the Court: Criminal Procedure Act, s 127; District Court Rules 1973 (NSW), Pt 53, r 10D.  Practices have varied with respect to the point at which an accused named in an indictment is arraigned: see R v Howard (1992) 29 NSWLR 242 at 247 (Gleeson CJ, Sheller JA and Lee AJ).  However, arraignment involves a court proceeding in which an indictment is read to the accused and he or she is asked to plead guilty or not guilty.  The effect of a not guilty plea is provided in s 154 of the Criminal Procedure Act:
154 Plea of ""not guilty""
If an accused person arraigned on an indictment pleads ""not guilty"", the accused person is taken to have put himself or herself on the country for trial, and the court is to order a jury for trial accordingly.
17In R v Nicolaidis (1994) 33 NSWLR 364 at 367, Gleeson CJ, after setting out the terms of s 395 of the Crimes Act (the predecessor to s 154 of the Criminal Procedure Act), stated:
""The arraignment marks the commencement of a trial by jury.  Persons who are tried in the District Court for indictable offences are formally arraigned, in the presence of the jurors in waiting, and immediately before the jury is empanelled. Of course, a jury will only be empanelled if the plea is one of not guilty.
Notwithstanding the procedure of arraignment that takes place at the commencement of a trial, it is ... the practice in the District Court for persons charged with indictable offences to be arraigned within a relatively short time after having been committed for trial and sometimes many weeks or even months in advance of the hearing date of the trial.  In such cases, assuming the accused adhered to a plea of not guilty, there would be at least two, and perhaps more, arraignments, the last being at the commencement of the trial. ...  No doubt one of the reasons for the procedure of early arraignment after committal is to permit the District Court to take early control of cases for the purpose of pre-trial management: cf Jago v District Court of New South Wales ... at 37 and note the provisions of Pt 53 of the District Court Rules 1973.""
(Nicolaidis involved the operation of s 53 of the Criminal Procedure Act, as in force in 1992, which provided for a ""sentence indication hearing"" which could be sought by an accused ""before or at arraignment"": the reference was held to be to the first arraignment.)
18In TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 the appellant attempted to establish that a miscarriage of justice had occurred because trial counsel for the accused had failed to obtain ""an advance ruling"" from the trial judge as to the effect of leading character evidence in the defence case.  Reliance was placed upon Pt 53, rr 10 and 11 of the District Court Rules to support the availability of such a procedure.  Rule 10 empowered the court to make interlocutory orders prior to ""the day appointed for the hearing"" and further provided that, where practicable, application for such  orders should be made before that day.  TKWJ was understood to cast doubt on the power of the court to make 'advance rulings' binding on the trial judge. 
19The jurisdiction and powers of the court after presentation of an indictment are now found in s 130 of the Criminal Procedure Act, in the following terms:
130 Trial proceedings after presentation of indictment and before empanelment of jury
(1) In this section, court means the Supreme Court or District Court.
(2) The court has jurisdiction with respect to the conduct of proceedings on indictment as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused person is arraigned, and any orders that may be made by the court for the purposes of the trial in the absence of a jury may be made before a jury is empanelled for the trial.
(3) If proceedings are held for the purpose of making any such orders after the indictment is presented to commence the trial and before the jury is empanelled:
(a) the proceedings are part of the trial of the accused person, and(b) the accused person is to be arraigned again on the indictment when the jury is empanelled for the continuation of the trial.
20Section 130 began as s 19 of the Criminal Procedure Act, with effect from 4 January 1998: Crimes Legislation Amendment (Procedure) Act 1997 (NSW), Sch 2 [2]; Government Gazette, No 1, 2 January 1998, p 3.  The precise scope and operation of the provision may not have been fully considered at the trial (in May 1998) of the matter which came to the High Court as TKWJ.  There was no reference to that provision in the appeal judgments.  In any event, a new provision, s 130A, was inserted in the Criminal Procedure Act commencing on 1 December 2005, providing that in respect of prescribed sexual offences a ""pre-trial order"" made by a judge is binding on the trial judge unless the latter forms the opinion that it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding: Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual Offence Case Management) Act 2005 (NSW), Sch 1 [1].  Commencing on 1 February 2010, s 130A was amended to make it generally applicable in criminal proceedings: Criminal Procedure Amendment (Case Management) Act 2009 (NSW), Sch 1 [3].  (See also new s 192A of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), introduced by the Evidence Amendment Act 2007 (NSW), Sch 1 [77].)
Commencement of trial on indictment21Arraignment for the purpose of taking a plea will determine whether the accused is to go to trial.  The effect of a 'not guilty' plea is thus to require an order for a jury trial: s 154.  That trial will be before a jury, absent a specific order for a trial by judge alone: Criminal Procedure Act, ss 131 and 132.  On one view, absent statutory provision to the contrary, the trial would not be thought to commence at that point, although there are statements in the cases to the effect that arraignment will mark the start of a trial on the charges alleged in the indictment: see, eg, PM v The Queen [2007] HCA 49; 232 CLR 370 at [38].  However, that statement was made with respect to an indictment to which a plea was taken immediately preceding the empanelling of a jury: at [13].  It is thus not decisive on the effect of an earlier arraignment.
22On the other hand, there is long standing authority for the proposition that a trial may commence on the date of an accused's first arraignment before the court: Newell v The King [1936] HCA 50; 55 CLR 707 at 712 (Latham CJ and Dixon J), 713 (Evatt J).  It is true that the Criminal Code (Tas) in issue in that case contained a provision that ""[t]he trial shall be deemed to begin when the accused is called upon to plead"": s 351(6), set out in precise terms in Director of Public Prosecutions (SA) v B [1998] HCA 45; 194 CLR 566 at [16] (Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ).  The joint reasons in B then noted that there was ""no equivalent provision in South Australia.""  A footnote to the Tasmanian provision read, ""cf Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 395"".  The footnote also referred to equivalent provisions in Victoria and Queensland and to cases in those States and in Western Australia: there is little to be gained from a review of the legislative schemes in different jurisdictions.  That point is made by the joint reasons in B which, dealing with South Australian legislation, noted the statement by King CJ in Attorney-General's Reference No 1 of 1988 (1988) 49 SASR 1 at 5-6, that:
""In this State, therefore, the trial commences when the accused having been arraigned before the judge who is try him, that judge embarks upon the hearing and determination of any preliminary questions or upon the empanelling of the jury.""
23Having set out that passage at [15], the joint reasons then stated at [17]:
""It may be that the answer to the question - when does the trial begin - requires consideration of the context within which that question arises and does not admit of an answer of the generality given in Attorney-General's Reference No 1 of 1988.""
24Even the Tasmanian provision contained a latent ambiguity because an accused might be arraigned on more than one occasion and, at least in modern times, frequently is.  However, the question in Newell was whether a statutory amendment permitting majority verdicts applied to Mr Newell's trial in circumstances where he had entered his plea prior to the commencement of the legislation.  The Court held that, whether to be described as a procedural amendment or not, such a provision should not be given retrospective effect to vary a central feature of a criminal trial which had already begun.  The context thus provides a ready explanation of the decision.
25The submissions in this Court focused on the effect of s 130(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act.  That too, read in isolation, might be considered ambiguous.  Referring to orders made ""after the indictment is presented to commence the trial and before the jury is empanelled"" might refer only to the last arraignment immediately preceding the process of empanelling the jury.  However, it seems clear from subs (2) that orders may be made by the court ""for the purposes of the trial"" as soon as the indictment has been presented and the accused is arraigned (for the first time).  The phrase ""as soon as"", taken with the requirement that an indictment be presented within four weeks of committal for trial (s 129(2)) indicates that the making of orders referred to in s 130(2) is not limited to those immediately preceding the empanelling of a jury.  That purpose is reflected in the period identified in subs (3) which commences ""after the indictment is presented"" and by the reference back implicit in the phrase ""such orders"".  Accordingly, the statement that such proceedings form ""part of the trial"" indicates that the trial must commence prior to the arraignment before a jury, or before a pool of jurors waiting to be empanelled.
26The Director accepted this last conclusion, but submitted that it did not avail the applicants in the present case: there were no orders made by the Court for the purposes of the trial prior to the date fixed for hearing.  The position might have been different, the Director accepted, if there had been a voir dire or some other advance ruling, for example, pursuant to s 192A of the Evidence Act, as to the admissibility of evidence proposed to be adduced.  There was none, he submitted, in the present case.
27This submission should not be accepted, for two reasons.  First, the primary purpose of s 130(2) is to declare the point from which the court has jurisdiction with respect to ""the conduct of proceedings on indictment"".  As appeared from the reasoning of Brennan J in Jago, the point at which the Court has jurisdiction may be a matter of importance.  Thus in Jago (in 1989) Brennan J held that ""[t]he Criminal Procedure Act confers no power on the District Court to regulate any aspect of the exercise of the powers of prosecution before an indictment is presented"": at 37.  Indeed, he doubted the legal effect of listing a matter before presentation of the indictment.  According to that reasoning, absent presentation of an indictment and, in the terms of s 130, arraignment of the accused, the court may have no power to make an order fixing a date for trial.  One effect of such an order is to require that the accused, if on bail, attend at court on the day fixed.  Accordingly, s 130 should not be read in a restricted fashion as limited to orders relating to evidence or otherwise dealing with matters which could be dealt with in the course of a hearing, albeit in the absence of the jury.
28Secondly, if that is so, both taking a plea and fixing a date for trial involve proceedings and, in the latter case an order, falling within the scope of s 130.  Both steps were taken in the present case on 21 June 2012.  It follows that the proceedings on that date constituted ""part of the trial of the accused person"", pursuant to s 130(3).  
Operation of Costs Act, s 229That suggests that the applicants are entitled to succeed.  However, before reaching that conclusion it is necessary to address two further matters of construction.  First, as was accepted by the applicant, there are a number of provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act which use the term ""trial"" in a more limited sense and in contrast to ""pre-trial"" proceedings.  For example, s 130A refers to a ""pre-trial order"" that is ""binding on the trial judge"", subject to certain conditions.  A pre-trial order is defined to mean ""any order made after the indictment is first presented but before the empanelment of a jury for a trial"": s 130A(4).  Many case management provisions use similar terminology: see Ch 3, Pt 3, Div 3.  
30Secondly, it is necessary to consider the history of the Costs Act in order to determine whether some more limited reading should be given to the phrase ""the commencement of a trial"" in s 2(1)(a).  (It is convenient to consider the relevance of the provisions of the further Criminal Procedure Act after addressing this issue.)
31Since its enactment in 1967, the Costs Act has had two consistent elements, relevantly for present purposes.  First, it has applied to offences whether punishable summarily or upon indictment; secondly, it has applied where there is a successful outcome for the person charged, whether at trial or as a result of an appeal.  The first factor is of more significance for present purposes, because it requires that the language now found in s 2(1)(a) apply to summary proceedings, whether in the Local Court or the Supreme Court, and to proceedings dealt with on indictment, whether before a judge and jury or judge alone.
32As first enacted, the trial limb of s 2 applied where a defendant ""after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted or discharged as to the information then under inquiry"".  That language had two features which have changed.  First, it only operated where there had been a hearing on the merits; secondly, the language of discharge following an inquiry was apt to cover committal proceedings as well as trials.  The current language has been held not to apply to a committal proceeding: Director of Public Prosecutions v Howard [2005] NSWSC 987; 64 NSWLR 139 (Hoeben J).  
33In 2002, s 2 of the Costs Act was amended by the Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2001 (NSW), which commenced on 18 January 2002.  The existing s 2 became s 2(1) and two further subsections were added.  It is convenient to set out the relevant parts in full:
2 Certificate may be granted
(1) The Court or Judge or Justice or Justices in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may:
(a) where, after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings, a defendant is acquitted or discharged in relation to the offence concerned ...
grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act ....
(2) For the avoidance of doubt, a certificate may be granted in accordance with subsection (1)(a) following an acquittal or discharge of a defendant at any time during a trial, whether a hearing on the merits of the proceedings has occurred or not.
(3) In this section, trial, in relation to proceedings, includes preliminary proceedings that form part of the trial, for example, a voir dire.
34The scope of the power to grant a certificate was thus significantly expanded so that the relevant precondition was not the completion of a hearing on the merits, but rather the commencement of a trial in the proceedings, an important element of the current language.  The amendment, however, did not bring the relevant point in time back to the commencement of the proceedings.  This was clearly deliberate, as in s 3, since 1967, the opinion required to be specified in the certificate related to the reasonableness of instituting the proceedings if, ""before the proceedings were instituted"", the prosecution had had certain information.
35Accepting that the use of the term ""trial"" and the reference to ""proceedings ... in relation to the offence"" (in place of ""a hearing ... as to the information then under inquiry"") was designed to remove a power to grant a certificate with respect to committal proceedings, then the reference in subs (3) to ""preliminary proceedings that form part of the trial, for example, a voir dire"" would, consistently, exclude committal proceedings which do not form part of the trial on any view of that term.  The question remains as to what proceedings might properly fall within the description of ""preliminary proceedings that form part of the trial"".  
36The Costs Act cannot properly be construed without reference to the legislative scheme for the conduct of trials, both summary and on indictment: Sweeney v Fitzhardinge [1906] HCA 73; 4 CLR 716 at 726 (Griffith CJ); Certain Lloyd's Underwriters v Cross [2012] HCA 56; 248 CLR 378 at [96]-[97] (Kiefel J); State of New South Wales v Williamson [2012] HCA 57; 248 CLR 417 at [28]-[29] (French CJ and Hayne J).  Such cognate legislation was primarily the Criminal Procedure Act.
37It is not necessary to consider whether amendments to the Criminal Procedure Act which occurred after the introduction of the critical language in s 2 of the Costs Act might be relevant, on the basis that the Costs Act should be given an ambulatory effect, thus picking up variations in criminal procedure adopted after its enactment.  At the relevant date, the Criminal Procedure Act contained language which readily fitted within the terms of ss 2(2) and 2(3) of the Costs Act.  At that date s 130 (then s 19) of the Criminal Procedure Act dealt with proceedings which could clearly be described as ""preliminary proceedings"" and stated that those proceedings ""are part of the trial of the accused"": s 19(3)(a), now s 130(3)(a).
38A further amendment (the final amendment relevant for present purposes) was introduced by the Courts Legislation Miscellaneous Amendments Act 2002 (NSW), which commenced on 20 December 2002.  That amendment introduced a second limb in s 2(1)(a), by adding the words ""or a direction is given by the Director of Public Prosecutions that no further proceedings be taken"".  The purpose of this provision is evidently to permit a certificate to be granted where a prosecution does not proceed because the Director has made a decision that no further proceedings be taken.  (There may be uncertainty as to whether the decision relates to the offence charged, or the conduct the subject of the charge, but that is not presently in issue.)  
39The submissions of the parties proceeded on the basis that the second limb was in the alternative to the defendant being acquitted or discharged and thus was subject to the temporal requirement as to the commencement of a trial.  On that reading, the new words may have been by way of clarification rather than expansion: at least with respect to an indictable offence, the trial does not commence until the accused has been arraigned, after which, if the prosecution does not proceed, there must be a step involving the acquittal or discharge of the accused.  In any event, subject to the temporal condition, that language is apt to cover a decision taken by the Director not to prosecute, as occurred in the present case.  Accordingly, neither this amendment (nor any of the subsequent amendments) requires any variation of the conclusion that the definition of ""trial"" in s 2(3) was consistent with the language of what is now s 130(3) and thus s 2 applies with respect to the post-arraignment proceedings in the present case.
40Because it is the express language of s 130 which is to be found in the Costs Act, the fact that other provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act distinguish trial and pre-trial processes is not significant.  Indeed, it is the purpose (as the Director accepted) of s 130(3) to pick up such pre-trial orders as ""part of the trial"".  There is no reason to conclude that the language of the Costs Act, relevantly enacted after the introduction of s 130(3), was not intended to adopt the scheme of criminal proceedings then reflected in s 130.
Conclusions41It follows that the primary judge was in error in determining that he had no jurisdiction to grant a certificate under the Costs Act.  The applicants sought an order quashing that determination: that order should be made.  The applicants also sought an order in the nature of mandamus directing that the District Court, constituted by the primary judge, determine the application for a certificate.  There is no need for an order in that form as there is no reason to doubt that the application, which remains outstanding, will be dealt with by the District Court.  No doubt the applicants would favour a return of the matter to Judge Armitage on the basis that he is familiar with the circumstances of their cases and has indicated a tentative view in favour of granting a certificate had he the power to do so.
42Where there has been a hearing on the merits, it will often be desirable that an application under the Costs Act be dealt with by the judge before whom the matter was heard.  That consideration does not arise in the present case.  Nor were the circumstances of the hearing of the costs application such as to make it essential, or even desirable, for the efficient administration of justice, that the matter return to the primary judge.  Even were that circumstance established, the listing of the application in the District Court would properly be a matter for that Court and not for direction by this Court.  Further, the expression of preliminary views by the primary judge is not of itself a reason to refer the matter back to him: cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11; 215 CLR 518 at [17] (Gleeson CJ), [39] (McHugh J) and [61] (Gummow and Hayne JJ).
43Perhaps because the subject matter of the proceedings in the District Court related to a criminal indictment, the applicants did not seek costs in this Court.  Accordingly no order should be made.  However, in the normal course, they would have been entitled to an award of costs of the proceedings in this Court: AB v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 122 at [31]-[32].  If any such order is sought, and it cannot be dealt with by consent, the applicants can make application to vary this judgment within 14 days, in accordance with the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), r 36.16(3A).
44The Court should make the following orders:
(1) Set aside the judgment of the District Court delivered on 26 July 2013 dismissing an application for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW).  
(2) Declare that, in the circumstances of the case, the Court had power to grant a certificate pursuant to s 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act.  
(3) Remit the matter to the District Court to be determined in accordance with the declaration of this Court.
45WARD JA:  I agree with Basten JA.

2422426,Dunks v R [2014] NSWCCA 134,"Judgment
1GLEESON JA:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2R A HULME J:  Ronnie Paul Dunks, the appellant, was found guilty by a jury following a trial in the District Court at Goulburn of an offence of break, enter and steal in circumstances of aggravation (namely, that he was in company).  This offence is contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
3The appellant was sentenced by Acting Judge Freeman on 24 January 2013 to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.  There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence.
Grounds of appeal
4The appellant relies upon two grounds of appeal against conviction:
1. The trial judge erred in finding that the text message sent by Carrie Clayton to [K] was a ""prior consistent statement"" for the purposes of re-establishing Clayton Carrie's credit pursuant to section 108(3) of the Evidence Act thereby leading to a substantial miscarriage of justice.
2. The trial judge erred by failing to consider the provisions of section 192 of the Evidence Act before granting the Crown leave to re-examine Clayton Carrie pursuant to section 108(3) of the Evidence Act leading to a substantial miscarriage of justice.
5The reference to ""K"" is a reference to the daughter of the appellant's partner who cannot be named because she was under the age of 18: s 15A Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW).
6In short, the contention of the appellant is that there was error in the Crown being permitted to adduce and tender evidence in order to re-establish the credit of an accomplice witness.  The evidence was relied upon as a prior consistent statement said to be admissible pursuant to s 108(3)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). 
The proceedings
7The trial was listed to commence on Monday 12 November 2012.  Clayton Carrie was to be jointly tried with the appellant.  The appellant's partner was also charged with being an accessory after the fact.  On the second day of pre-trial discussions Mr Carrie was arraigned and entered a plea of guilty.  It was indicated that he had offered to assist by giving evidence for the prosecution. 
8The trial commenced with empanelment of the jury on the Wednesday that week.  Mr Carrie was sentenced on the Thursday and was called to give evidence the following day.  At the commencement of his evidence it was disclosed to the jury that he had pleaded guilty and had received a discount on his sentence on account of his offer of assistance.
The Crown case
9The Crown case was that on 15 November 2011 at about 7.00pm the appellant and Mr Carrie, broke open the back door at 41 West Parade, Hilltop and entered the home.  They then assaulted the occupant, Ms Terese Channon, stole her medications, money from her wallet, her mobile phone and a bank statement.
10Earlier that evening the appellant had travelled to a medical centre in Hilltop with his partner, Melissa Spulis, her daughter and Mr Carrie. He entered the medical centre while they waited in the car.  The receptionist gave evidence that he seemed extremely agitated; he was rocking back and forth and pacing around.  He said he had just been discharged from hospital with no prescriptions and he needed to see a doctor (he did not have an appointment).  The doctor on duty agreed to see him.  The doctor was not prepared to give him a prescription for the drug that he sought, Oxycontin.  A longer appointment was required before such a prescription would be provided.  An appointment was made for 11.00am the following day (which he did not keep).
11The appellant returned to those waiting in the car and, according to Mr Carrie, said, ""We need to go to Tess. I'm going to take her shit, her drugs"".  (It was common ground that Ms Channon was known to be a person who was prescribed Oxycontin. It was the defence contention that she was a supplier to others of that drug.)  
12Ms Channon's treating doctor gave evidence of how she had been prescribed a number of medications including Oxycontin.  Her evidence included that if a regular user of that drug stopped taking it they would soon suffer symptoms such as agitation, sweating, stomach cramps, diarrhoea and nausea. 
13Ms Channon gave evidence of hearing banging at her back door.  Two men came in, one wearing a balaclava (the appellant) and the other with a hood over his head (Mr Carrie).  She described the various ways in which she was assaulted and in which demands were made for her medication.  The men searched the house and various items of property were taken.  The men then fled to a car and were driven away.  
14Neighbours had heard noise emanating from Ms Channon's house and the police were called.  One of them described hearing a loud bang, Ms Channon screaming, and further banging and crashing.  Ms Channon was heard to call out for help.  After the men had left she was assisted by neighbours who observed that she was dishevelled, hysterical, screaming and crying.  A friend was called and attended immediately.  Ms Channon gave an account which, albeit brief, was consistent with the effect of her evidence in the trial. The friend also gave evidence of seeing the interior of the home which was in an abnormal state of disarray, consistent with having been ransacked.
15The police officer in charge of the investigation attended upon Ms Channon at the Bowral Hospital the following morning.  He observed and took photographs of her injuries:  a swollen cheek, a bruised upper arm and red marks to her stomach.  He also took photographs of damage to her residence including the lock and the door through which the men had entered.
The defence case
16The appellant gave evidence to the effect that Ms Channon was supplying others with Oxycontin.  He became concerned that she was supplying it to his partner's teenage daughter.  The appellant had been receiving prescriptions for Oxycontin from various doctors.  He admitted going to the medical centre on the evening of 15 November 2011 and did not deny that he appeared agitated. However, he said that was because he was pretending to be in more pain than he was.  He denied that he was experiencing withdrawal symptoms.  
17The appellant said that when they arrived at Ms Channon's home she opened the door after he knocked.  Neither he nor Mr Carrie kicked open the door. He denied putting on a balaclava.  There was no searching of the house or ransacking it.  Ms Channon was not assaulted. To his knowledge, nothing was stolen.  He later became aware that Ms Channon's mobile phone containing his SIM card was found in his partner's handbag.  He explained that he was told that Mr Carrie had given it to her.
18In cross-examination the appellant said that it was always the intention to go to Ms Channon's home after attending the medical centre.  He was not desperate to go to her place because he had been refused Oxycontin by the doctor.  The main issue was to tell her to stop supplying the drug to his partner's teenage daughter. 
Attack on credibility of Clayton Carrie
19Counsel for the appellant challenged Mr Carrie on a variety of topics, partly to adduce evidence consistent with the defence case and partly to impugn his credibility.  The defence version of events was put to him and he agreed with some aspects but disagreed with those that were exculpatory of the appellant.  The cross-examination generally as to his credibility culminated with the following exchange:
""Q.  See sir I suggest what you have done is again just looked after number one being yourself?A.  No.
Q.  That's what you've done here?A.  No sir.
Q.  You've tried as best you can to distance yourself from this?A.  No sir.
Q.  You've tried the best you can to put - to get the best result you could?A.  No sir.
Q.  Well you got a discount of 33 and a third per cent didn't you?A.  Yes I did.""
The text message
20The Crown Prosecutor's opening address included reference to a text message sent by Mr Carrie to the appellant's partner's daughter:
""Both the two accused and Clayton Carrie were arrested on 30 November 2011 and whilst Mr Carrie was being conveyed to the police station he sent a text message to [K], the daughter of Ms Spulis;
'Baby I'm arrested, I think I'm going to gaol bub, I love you forever, I'll be in Bowral cop shop, 'kay bub, going to need help, love you.  Please help out some way, that cunt got me into it so going to need help getting out'.""
21At the conclusion of that opening, Mr Scragg, counsel for the co-accused Spulis, raised an objection to the admissibility of that evidence in relation to his client.  The judge indicated that he did not think the Crown would be relying upon it in relation to her.  The Crown Prosecutor confirmed that was the case. Mr Williams, counsel for the appellant, then voiced his objection to it as well.  The objection was based upon the fact that it was ""after he's been arrested but not in the presence of Dunks or anyone"". There was then this exchange:
""CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Well your Honour in respect of the second matter [the text message] the Crown [proposes] to call Mr Carrie to give evidence and his evidence will be that he committed this offence-""
HIS HONOUR:  Yes--
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  --with the accused Mr Dunks.
HIS HONOUR:  Yes, so this is a consistent statement blaming Mr Dunk relatively soon after the event is it?
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Yes.""
22There was then an exchange about an unrelated objection before a return to the topic:
""HIS HONOUR:  As to the text, it's not - it's certainly not admissible against Ms Spulis but it will be admissible against Mr Dunks on the basis of it being a consistent statement.
SCRAGG:  May it please the Court.
HIS HONOUR:  It may be, depending on the cross-examination, it may be that I have to reserve that question until I've heard Mr Carrie cross-examined.""
23Nothing more was said about the matter until the conclusion of the cross-examinations of Mr Carrie when the following occurred:
""HIS HONOUR:  Madam Crown?
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Your Honour, I have a number of questions but I do wish to seek your Honour's leave in respect of one of them.
HIS HONOUR:  Yes, do you need the jury out or can you indicate to me what it is?
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  I can your Honour, yes.
HIS HONOUR:  Yes, I grant you leave.  Section 108(3) is it?
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Yes, your Honour.
<RE-EXAMINATION BY CROWN PROSECUTOR
Q.  Mr Carrie, you've been asked questions both by Mr Williams and by Mr Scragg about it was suggested to you by Mr Williams that you would say anything that assisted you essentially, do you recall that?A.  Yes, I do.
Q.  And Mr Scragg that you were motivated to give this account to the jury by virtue of your discount and your desire to avoid police investigation to other matters?A.  That is what they put to me?
Q.  Yes, that's what they asked you, yes?A.  Yes, yes.
Q.  Do you recall when you arrested on 30 November 2011 and you were being transported from your home at Bargo to the police station?A.  Yes, I do.
Q.  Did you have your mobile phone on you?A.  I did.
Q.  Did you send a text message?A.  Yes, I did.
Q.  Who was that text message sent to?A.  [K]

Q.  You can see the second of the text messages on that phone?A.  Yes, I do.
Q.  Does that read,
'Baby I'm arrested, think I'm going to gaol bub.  I love you forever.  I'll be in Bowral cop shop okay.'
Does that say okay?
A.  Yes, it does.
Q.'Bub, going to need help.  Love you please help me someway.  That cunt got me into it so gunna need help getting out.  Need your mum's help okay or any help.'?A.  Yes.
Q.  According to the phone that was sent at 8.10 and 8.12 on 30 November?A.  Yes.
Q.  Is that the message or messages that you sent whilst you were in the police van being conveyed to the police on the day of your arrest?A.  Yes.
Q.  To [K]?A.  Yes.
Q.  When you say, 'Please help me someway that cunt got me into it' what cunt were you referring to?A.  Ronnie Dunks.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Yes, I tender that photograph.
WILLIAMS:  Your Honour has heard me on this.
HIS HONOUR:  And you've heard me.
SCRAGG:  I have, yes.
EXHIBIT #H PHOTOGRAPH OF MOBILE PHONE WITH TEXT MESSAGES TENDERED, ADMITTED WITHOUT OBJECTION""
24At the conclusion of the re-examination the appellant's counsel was permitted to further cross-examine Mr Carrie.  He confined his questioning to other matters that had been covered in the re-examination and did not ask any questions in relation to the text message.
25Mr Carrie was recalled for further cross-examination by both counsel later in the trial. Again, counsel for the appellant asked no questions in relation to the text message.
26The Crown Prosecutor made the following use of this evidence in her closing address when she was dealing with the subject of Mr Carrie's evidence:
""It was suggested to him by the defence, well, you just gave this version because you were to receive a discount on [your] sentence and also you were possibly going to be investigated by police into your alleged sexual relationship with [K], and also you were concerned about your possible investigation into your alleged drug supply to [K].
Well, in assessing that, members of the jury, look at this?  He nominated himself, as well as Mr Dunks, he nominated himself, he pleaded guilty, he's serving a sentence, and look at the text message that he sent [K] from the police vehicle on the way to the police station at the time of his arrest:
'Baby I'm arrested.  Think I'm going gaol but I love you forever.  I'll be in Bowral copy shop, K bub?  Gonna need help.  Love you.  Please help me some way.  That cunt got me into it so gonna need help getting out.'
And that cunt, he said, was this accused Mr Dunks.  Something he did immediately upon his arrest.  Not after he had time to contemplate all these options, you might think.  Before he had even spoken to a lawyer.  Before he had time to catch his breath.  Didn't even intend for police to see this text, you might think, done in secret in the van.  It was only because police were at the other end and saw the text coming through on [K's] phone that they knew anything about it.
Nominated Ronnie Dunks as getting him into it.  Entirely inconsistent, you might think, with Ronnie having simply asked him to come in with him to confront Tess about her alleged continued supply of medication.  Entirely consistent with a version that he gave you here in Court.  He and Ronnie Dunks broke, entered and stole from Ms Channon.""
27The solicitor for the appellant in this Court accepted that there was no cross-examination of Mr Carrie about the text message and nothing said in the closing address of his then counsel about any alternative interpretation that might be placed upon it other than that suggested by the Crown Prosecutor. 
Ground 1 - error in finding that the text message was a ""prior consistent statement""
Preliminary matter
28Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge should not have indicated that the text message would be admissible after the Crown had opened on it. Any potential attack on Mr Carrie's credit and more relevantly any suggestion of fabrication or reconstruction was simply not known at that time. It also meant that the Crown had received the benefit of the text message by the time Mr Carrie was re-examined. 
29This is a separate question to whether the text message was a prior consistent statement. It has no bearing on the appeal. An opening address by the Crown provides a statement of the nature of the charge and a brief outline of the Crown case, and may include reference to the evidence it anticipates will arise in the course of the trial.  The trial judge clearly directed the jury in these terms: ""What [the Crown] says is not itself evidence and you can't rely upon it to reach any conclusions of fact, but you'll find it a good deal easier to see where the evidence of each witness fits into the overall scheme of things if you've been told in advance what the overall scheme is"" (AB 296). 
30There was no error in the trial judge informing counsel in the absence of the jury that the text message ""will be admissible against Mr Dunks on the basis of it being a consistent statement"" [emphasis added]. The judge immediately qualified this by saying ""it may be that I have to reserve that question until I've heard Mr Carrie cross-examined."" In other words, he reserved final determination of the issue until after the cross-examination.
""Prior consistent statement""
31The appellant relied on the fact that the message made no express reference to Mr Dunks. Because of this, it could not be construed as being objectively consistent with Mr Carrie's assertion that it was Mr Dunks' idea to rob Ms Channon.  
32The appellant also suggested that the text message was inconsistent with Mr Carrie's evidence, insofar as he admitted to being fully complicit with Mr Dunks in the break and enter. Mr Carrie gave evidence, for example, that he understood what Mr Dunks was asking him to do and that he searched for drugs whilst in the house. Since the text message made no reference to these matters, it was inconsistent with Mr Carrie's admission that he was complicit in the break and enter.
33A prior consistent statement of a witness is defined in the Dictionary of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) to mean ""a previous representation that is consistent with evidence given by the witness"". Section 108 of the Evidence Act provides:
""108 Exception: re-establishing credibility 
(1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in re-examination of a witness. 
(3) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if: 
(a) evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted, or 
(b) it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or re-constructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion, 
and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement.""
34Section 108 provides an exception to the general rule that a party calling a witness may not have admitted credibility evidence in relation to that witness. If another party attacks the credibility of the witness, the party calling the witness may have admitted credibility evidence which rebuts the attack, in accordance with s 108 in this case. 
35In his examination in chief, Mr Carrie described the events leading up to the offence. After Mr Dunks had left the medical centre, having been denied the prescription for Oxycontin, he hopped back in the car and said, ""We need to go to Tess"", that is, the victim Ms Channon. The examination continued (at AB 483-4):
""Q. 'We need to go to Tess', what happened then?A. We drove to Therese Channon's house.
Q. And on the way there, was anything further said?A. Yes.
Q. What was said?A. 'I'm gong to take her drugs'.
Q. Anything further?A. And that I'm going to be coming into the house with him.
Q. Well, did Ronnie say this?A. Yes.
Q. As best you can do it, can you put it in the words as Ronnie used?A. 'You're coming with me'.
Q. Yes?A. Yes.
Q. And what else?A. And 'That I'm going to take her shit, her drugs'. 
Q. And what did you understand you were being asked to do?A. To go with him to the house and to take her drugs.
Q. How did you understand you were to get into the house?A. I wasn't sure at the time until we walked up to the front door.""
36Mr Carrie went on to provide an account of what happened inside the home which was to the effect that the appellant was the prime mover and Mr Carrie acted at his direction. 
37In this context it can clearly be seen that the text message was a prior representation by Mr Carrie blaming the appellant for having got Mr Carrie involved in the break and enter offence. It was consistent with Mr Carrie's evidence that it was the appellants' idea to go to the complainant's house and take the drugs and that the appellant had told Mr Carrie that he would be going into the complainant's house with him.
38There was no dispute at trial that Mr Carrie and the appellant went to Ms Channon's house on the relevant evening. Nor was there any suggestion that anyone else entered the complainant's home. 
39That Mr Carrie did not refer to his culpability for the offence in the message does not alter its meaning; namely, that it was the appellant's idea to go to Ms Channon's house and take her drugs. That is clearly what was meant by ""I think I'm going to gaol ... that cunt got me into it"".
40The text message had the ability to answer or rebut the attack that had been made on Mr Carrie's credibility. It was clearly a prior consistent statement.  Counsel for the appellant cross-examined with knowledge of the possible use of it in re-examination.  Admissibility was so obvious that it is little wonder that he did not wish to be heard further before his Honour made a final ruling on admissibility at the commencement of that re-examination. There is no merit in this ground.
Ground 2 - s 192 not considered before granting of leave
41In the event that ground 1 was rejected, the appellant relied on s 192 of the Evidence Act. It was submitted that the trial judge erroneously failed to consider any of the mandatory matters in s 192 before granting of leave, s 192(2)(b), (c) and (e) in particular. 
42Section 192 provides:
""192 Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms 
(1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit. 
(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account: 
(a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and 
(b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and 
(c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and 
(d) the nature of the proceeding, and 
(e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.""
43The absence of specific reference to s 192 does not amount to error: R v Reardon [2002] NSWCCA 203; 186 FLR 1 at [23]-[32]; R v RTB [2002] NSWCCA 104 at [88]; R v Selsby [2004] NSWCCA 381 at [58]. 
44Hodgson JA said in Reardon that: 
[30] ... unless the contrary may be inferred from the circumstances or from what a judge does say, it should be assumed that a judge hearing a case will continually be having regard, in making such decisions as in the judge's other acts and omissions during the course of the hearing, to ... the matters referred to in s 192(2).
[31] These are all matters normally uppermost in a judge's mind throughout the conduct of a first instance hearing, and it would be strange indeed that there should be a legislative requirement that they be articulated on every occasion when there is leave or permission granted or a direction given under the Evidence Act. To require a bald incantation of regard to the section or to the items referred to would be to promote an empty formality; while to require reasoned discussion of each item on every occasion would be absurdly onerous and productive of delay and injustice.
45The appellant relied on the decision of Simpson J in R v Esho; R v Sako [2001] NSWCCA 415 where it was held that in granting leave to the prosecutor the trial judge erroneously failed to consider all of the paragraphs of s 192(2) and their possible application to the particular circumstances in the case (at [91]). 
46In Esho the Crown sought leave to question a Crown witness as though cross-examining him (Evidence Act s 38). Counsel for the defence alleged that the witness had given numerous different versions of events and objected on the basis that he did not know what version as going to be led. After broadly clarifying the case that would be led by the Crown, the trial judge granted leave and did not advert to s 192 in so doing. Because of the various accounts allegedly provided by the witness, Simpson J said on appeal that, ""[s]o far as I can ascertain, paragraphs (b) and (c) were potentially important here"". 
47The same cannot be said for the present case. There is no force in the appellant's argument that unfairness arose out of the fact that Mr Carrie was not asked to make a statement about what he meant in the text message, therefore allowing him to provide a self-serving explanation in re-examination. He was clearly referring to someone as ""that cunt"" and it is not clear how any explanation would serve to render it any less ""self-serving"". 
48The appellant also submitted that the text message would be likely to be misused by the jury as evidence directly probative of Mr Dunks' guilt and would cut across his defence that he was seeking to protect [K]. That this may have been the case is not relevant to the exercise of s 108, however. As the High Court said in Graham v The Queen [1998] HCA 61; 195 CLR 606 at 609:""Whether, if admissible, the complaint becomes evidence of the truth of what is asserted is not relevant to the exercise of the discretion to give leave under s 108. The exercise of the discretion under s 108 depends upon the effect of the evidence on the witness's credibility: here, the suggestion of fabrication"".
49None of the specific matters in s 192 had any material bearing on the question of admissibility of the text message and Mr Carrie's amplification of what he intended to convey by it.  Accordingly there was no need for the trial judge to expressly refer to them.  This ground has no merit either.
An armchair appeal
50There is a final observation that must be made and that is there is an air of unreality about this appeal.  A matter that occupied perhaps a minute or two of discussion about admissibility at trial has involved many pages of written submissions and considerable time in oral argument advancing a variety of reasons why the evidence should not have been admitted.  And it concerned a matter of marginal significance in an otherwise compelling Crown case (see the points identified in the Crown's written submissions at [41]). 51The submission at trial was confined to ""that message on the phone is not evidence against Dunks because ... its Clayton Carrie saying something to [K] after he's been arrested but not in the presence of Dunks or anyone"".  But on appeal there were a whole host of matters raised that a very experienced trial counsel never thought to mention (and for good reason).
52This case truly fits the description of an ""armchair"" appeal, a description often used in a deprecating fashion when points never raised at trial are sought to be raised on appeal.  The term was explained by Johnson J in Darwiche v R; El-Zeyat v R; Aouad v R; Osman v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170] :
""... where counsel not involved in the trial has gone through the record of the trial in minute detail looking for error or possible arguments without reference to the manner in which the trial was conducted: R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; 123 A Crim R 310 at 319-330 [40]-[45]; Ilioski v R [2006] NSWCCA 164 at [155].""
53This Court has recently held that leave pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is required to argue a matter on appeal on a basis different to that which was the subject of the objection taken at trial:  Poniris v R [2014] NSWCCA 100 at [51]-[56] (Macfarlan JA).  The matter was not the subject of submissions in the present case; otherwise I would be disposed to refusing leave.
Order
54I propose the following order:  Appeal against conviction dismissed.
