Seow Fook Thiam (the appellant) was convicted by district judge Tay Yong Kwang on a charge of aggravated outraging of modesty under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The charge alleged that on 8 October 1996, at the second floor landing of the complainant`s residential block in Geylang, the appellant used criminal force on the complainant intending to outrage her modesty, to wit, by using his hands to squeeze her breasts. It was alleged that, in order to facilitate the commission of the offence, he had voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to the complainant. The appellant was sentenced to 30 months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. He appealed against his conviction and sentence.
 The prosecution`s case
The complainant stayed in the block opposite the appellant`s block. The kitchen and bedroom windows of their third storey flats faced one another. Their children had played together in the same playground. The complainant and the appellant were known to each other.
On 8 October 1996, at about 6pm, the complainant left home to buy dinner for her family. On her way home, she met the appellant at the multi-storey car-park. He asked her where she was going. She replied that she was on her way home. The appellant followed the complainant and said that he wanted to collect the buboh-chacha container in which he had delivered his wife`s buboh-chacha the week before. Despite being told by the complainant that she had thrown the container away, the appellant continued to follow the complainant.
The appellant followed the complainant to the void deck of her block and asked her if there was anyone at her home. The complainant replied that her sister was waiting in the flat and walked up the stairs.
The appellant continued to follow the complainant. When she reached the staircase landing of the second level, he caught hold of her left hand from the back and hugged her from behind. The appellant put his arms around her and used both hands to squeeze her breasts.
The complainant shouted for the appellant to take his hands off her and for him to let go of her. The appellant let her go almost immediately and she ran one storey up to her third floor flat next to the staircase.
The evidence of the complainant`s sister, PW3, must be considered at this point. PW3 testified that she heard a loud shout:
 
 
Q: Just shouting or what? You don`t know who was screaming or shouting ? 
 
A: Just like `Ahhhh ... !` That`s why I asked, is that you? 
 
Q: You didnt`t go out to look or find out ? 
 
A: No. I asked, is that you and after a while, she came up already. I saw her in a few seconds. A few seconds she rushed up already, so I didn`t go out. I was at the gates. 
 
Q: What did she do then ? 
 
A: She looked very pale and I asked her what happened. 
 
Q: Maybe she was not feeling well ? 
 
A: Before she left, she was OK. That`s why I asked her what happened. 
 
Q: Then what ? 
 
A: She was quite nervous, I told her to calm down. I saw redness, like finger marks, on her left arm.
  
 
 
PW3 asked the complainant to report the incident to the police but the complainant wanted to wait until her husband returned before doing so. The complainant`s three children had returned home, and PW3 had to leave because her husband was waiting downstairs for her. Before leaving, PW3 went to the kitchen window to look across into the appellant`s flat and saw him entering his bathroom.
The complainant`s husband, (PW2) owned a stall selling chicken rice. On the day of the incident, PW2 returned home sometime after 9pm. PW2 testified that he noticed that the complainant was in a bad mood, but he did not think too much of this, even when his children told him that somebody had caught hold of their mother`s hand. It was only after the two eldest children fell asleep that the complainant told her husband about the incident.
During cross-examination, PW2 agreed that his wife had not mentioned and had not shown him any bruises on her arm. However, he confirmed that she had said that the appellant had caught hold of her arm very tightly.
PW2 accompanied his wife to the police station to report the incident. He said that, although they both could speak Mandarin, the policeman could only understand Hokkien. PW2 helped his wife to make the report because the complainant is Teochew and can only manage a smattering of Hokkien interspersed with Teochew. Both PW2 and the complainant were cross-examined as to why details of the molest were not given in her first police report made at the Neighbourhood Police Post. Their evidence was that the policeman had told them to leave the details to a later report to be made at the police station.
 The defence`s case
The appellant denied hugging or squeezing the complainant`s breasts. These denials were made against a background of allegations that he and the complainant were secretly involved. The scenario painted of their `secret affair` was of an `intimate` relationship devoid of sexual intercourse but which consisted of touching `here and there` on the few occasions they were together.
The appellant testified that on the date in question, 8 October 1996, he met the complainant at the multi-storey car park. She asked him to accompany her home and they proceeded to walk together. The complainant asked him if his wife would be jealous if she were to see them walking together. The appellant told her that they were only walking and asked the complainant if her husband would be suspicious if he saw them together.
The appellant asked if he could go to the complainant`s place but she said that her younger sister was at her home. When he told her that he would not go up, she retorted by saying that he did not dare to go up. He explained that he did not want to arouse her sister`s suspicions that they may be involved with each other. He then touched her hand and said goodbye.
The appellant returned home, took a shower and left for his mother-in-law`s home. He placed his pager on top of the television set. At about 9pm there was a reminder beep on the pager. He saw the complainant`s telephone number on the pager`s screen. The appellant did not call her as she had told him before not to call between 9pm to 10pm when her husband would come home. He did not know how many times she paged for him that night.
The thrust of the appellant`s allegations of an affair was that, in his intimate relationship with the complainant, he was privy to highly personal information about her. His evidence included: (i). that the complainant had seen him on the job in his previous occupation as a trishaw rider and had commented that it placed him in a useful position to speak to Japanese women;
 (ii). that they had started talking to each other across the windows of their flats. Whenever the complainant saw the appellant carrying out his household chores, she would comment that he was a good husband, telling him that her own husband had to work full-day everyday except on Thursday, his off-day;
 (iii). that the complainant would gesture her telephone number to the appellant. In addition, the appellant also claimed that he gave the complainant his pager number and that she would page him; (they had once been out to eat yong tau foo and there had been another occasion when the complainant had paged him to buy duck rice for her);
 (iv). that the complainant had told him her husband watched adult movies and that there was some banter between them as to whether either of them had any adult movies to lend the other;
 (v). that the appellant had gone to the complainant`s home four or five times to help her with her part-time work. On these occasions, they would become intimate (once, the complainant put her arms around him and held him tightly);
 (vi). that the complainant had on one occasion gone to the appellant`s home on the pretext of borrowing an umbrella but, upon entering his flat, headed straight for the master bedroom. She then lay on his bed and pulled him to her, causing him to fall onto her whereupon they were intimate with each other;
 (vii). that, in the course of their intimacy, the complainant had told him of her Caesarean operation and her 24 stitches. She had also told him these stitches hurt and for him not to hold her too tightly;
 (viii). that he was able to describe the complainant`s flat in detail - where the brown dressing table was, the position of the wedding photograph above the bed, the use of one bedroom as a store, and a white cordless telephone on a table outside the master bedroom;
 (ix). that the complainant wore a necklace with a talisman and, because it was sacred, they could not make love. The appellant had been told by the complainant that her husband had given her either the necklace or the talisman.
 
 
The appellant`s wife, DW2, testified that she did not know the complainant`s full name or telephone number. The complainant had told her that she could not have any more children, but DW2 did not know about the complainant`s Caesarean operation. DW2 denied telling any of this to her husband.
DW3 was a fruit seller living on the same level and in the same block as the complainant. He testified that during the seventh lunar month festivities, he had seen the complainant come up from behind the appellant, touch the back of the appellant`s neck and stand very close to the appellant. They kept smiling at each other while she rested her hand on the appellant`s nape. There were only three of them at the void deck as it was afternoon. In cross-examination, DW3 said that the complainant probably could recognize him as her neighbour.
DW4 was the appellant`s former neighbour and visited the appellant frequently, at least once or twice a month. He testified that on one of his visits during the same seventh month festivities, sometime after 6pm, the complainant approached the appellant to borrow matches. DW4 said that they then engaged in intimate talk. They laughed as they talked and stood very close to each other. The complainant had tapped the appellant`s hand.
DW4 asked the appellant who she was and was told that she was a neighbour. In cross-examination, DW4 said it was after the incident that he had seen the complainant from the appellant`s flat. However, he had not previously seen the complainant in her flat. DW4 only knew from the appellant that the lady staying opposite was the one who had touched the appellant at the festivities and who had later accused him of molest.
 Decision of the district judge
The district judge narrowed the issues to be (i) the existence of an affair between the appellant and the complainant; and, (ii) the degree and the purpose of the appellant`s touch. In his view, there was no dispute that the appellant was with the complainant at the time and the place alleged in the charge. It was also agreed that a shout had emanated from the complainant when the appellant touched her.
The district judge found the evidence of the prosecution`s two main witnesses, the complainant and PW3, entirely truthful and reliable. Their evidence was cogent and consistent and did not differ in any material aspect. The complainant`s description of the events surrounding the incident was reinforced and corroborated by PW3`s evidence on the scream and the complainant rushing upstairs thereafter.
As for the allegation of `wrongful restraint`, the district judge considered evidence that the appellant had let the complainant go, almost immediately upon her shouts to be released. However, the district judge found that by holding the complainant from behind and pulling her towards him, there was `wrongful restraint` within the meaning of s 339 of the Penal Code.
In contrast to the complainant`s evidence, the district judge found material parts of the appellant`s testimony `intrinsically unbelievable`. The district judge was of the opinion that it would have been schizophrenic behaviour on the part of the complainant, if his evidence was to be believed. According to the defence`s version of events, the complainant had asked the appellant to walk her home and had not dared to talk too much because her sister was around. Yet the complainant had shouted `ahhh ...` in response to his touch and gentle goodbye. The district judge found that there would have been absolutely no reason for the complainant to shout if there was something going on between the two of them. The district judge also noted the defence`s failure to put many matters to the prosecution`s witnesses for their response.
The district judge further observed contradictions in the appellant`s case. The appellant had put a version of the incident (that there was hugging) contradicting his defence (that there was no hugging at all on 8 October 1996) to the complainant. Another contradiction was where the appellant had maintained that the evidence in his police statement was the truth although it differed from his testimony given in court. Furthermore, the appellant had failed to explain why he had denied any affair with the complainant in his statement, saying that `she is only my neighbour.`
The district judge had no doubt that DW3 and DW4 were merely trying to support the appellant`s defence that he was having an affair with the complainant. Their testimony offered no concrete evidence and DW4`s evidence that the appellant had denied touching the complainant contradicted the appellant`s own testimony.
Finally, it was clear to the district judge that the appellant`s s 122(6) statement (exh P4) made in response to the charge and the notice of warning was an admission of guilt. The district judge did not accept the defence`s submission that the prosecution`s failure to call Sergeant Ang raised an adverse presumption against the prosecution under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). This was because Sergeant Ang`s role was peripheral to the actual recording of the statement.
 Appeal against conviction
The same arguments were canvassed at the appeal before me. The appellant contended that the district judge failed to give adequate consideration to the appellant`s evidence in deciding on the facts and that the complainant`s evidence was not `unusually convincing`. His submissions may be classified into two categories dealing with the following issues.
 The existence of an affair
The appellant contended that his ability to describe the complainant`s place in detail was evidence of his intimate relationship with the complainant. This was despite the absence of evidence to prove that he could have known this just by observing from his flat opposite.
The appellant`s knowledge of the complainant`s call-back facility, for example, was something he claimed that even the complainant`s husband was unaware of. In my view, considering the complainant had earlier agreed that most of her neighbours knew about her Caesarean operation, much less intimacy should be assumed of a relationship where information about one`s subscription to the call-back facility is exchanged. I had no difficulty agreeing with the district judge`s finding that such knowledge was `nothing exceptional`.
The district judge went on to add that `it was quite plain from the appellant`s own testimony that he had been paying close attention to the complainant before and after the incident on 8 October 1996`. This was clear from the appellant`s testimony in re-examination:
 
 
Court: You have never seen the victim in her bedroom ? 
 
A: When cleaning my windows, I could see her taking a shower in her master bedroom. I mean, finished taking a shower and wrapped in a towel.
  
 
 
The appellant contended that information such as the complainant and her husband`s bathing habits could only be known to him as the complainant`s lover. However, despite the alleged significance of this, such allegations were not put to either the complainant or PW2. Furthermore, the appellant`s own evidence above suggested that it was not impossible for him to observe such `bathing habits` when cleaning his windows.
I saw no reason to disagree with the district judge`s findings of the defence`s evidence. In para 138, he observed:
 
It was intriguing that the accused talked of intimacy, of a secret or close relationship with the complainant but stopped short of saying they had sex or had even seen each other`s bodies. He explained that they could not have sex because of the talisman the complainant was wearing but went on to say that it was alright if the talisman was kept inside the neck of the complainant`s T-shirt. In my opinion, he was quite assiduous in maintaining that he would have been unable to describe where the 24 stitch-marks on her abdomen were if he were to maintain otherwise and was challenged. I found his testimony that they would hug and kiss and fondle but only with their clothes on in a relationship which had started in February/March 1996 quite unbelievable, especially in the light of his testimony that the complainant had gone into his flat like a tigress on the prowl and had made a beeline for his bedroom and his bed and then caused him to fall on her by her forceful tug.
 
 
 
 
 The extent of the appellant`s touch
 
The appellant contended that the complainant had failed to mention the bruises to her husband. However, it was never suggested that the appellant`s hold of the complainant`s arm caused bruising nor was it necessary to do so to prove `wrongful restraint`. Instead, the complainant`s testimony referred to the redness produced by the appellant`s tight grip on her left arm. This `redness` was again brought up in PW3`s evidence of her independent observation.
The appellant had further contended that there was a material discrepancy in the testimonies of PW2 and PW3 as to exactly when the complainant related the molest to PW3. This contention could not be correct because the material fact remained that PW3 noticed the `redness, like finger marks, on her left arm` without the complainant bringing it to her attention. Therefore it was irrelevant 
 when 
 the molest itself was related to PW3, whether immediately after the complainant rushed in or a short while later. In any case, it could not have been much later, since PW3 had to leave in a rush because her husband was waiting downstairs for her.
The district judge made the following findings in paras 141 and 142 of his grounds of decision:
 
In summary, I found the prosecution`s two main witnesses, the complainant and her sister, entirely truthful and reliable although they differed somewhat concerning the number of children at home and the house keys. What was material was whether the accused had accosted the complainant on the staircase landing that day and had done the acts specified in the charge. The evidence of the complainant on the events immediately preceding the incident and the incident itself was cogent and consistent. Her sister`s evidence on the scream and the complainant rushing upstairs thereafter reinforced and corroborated the complainant`s testimony as to what had transpired on the landing. Even if the accused had released the complainant immediately upon her scream and shouts to let her go, there was still `wrongful restraint` within the meaning of s 339 Penal Code which reads :
 
 
 
`Whoever voluntarily obstructs any person, so as to prevent that person from proceeding in any direction in which that person has a right to proceed, is said wrongfully to restrain that person.`
 
 
 
One can obstruct another by blocking him at the front or by otherwise preventing or retarding his progress from behind, beside or even beneath him. The accused had wrongfully restrained the complainant by holding her from behind and pulling her towards him.
 
 
 
I had no doubt that the accused was telling blatant lies about his alleged relationship with the complainant. Not only were material parts of his testimony, especially on the events immediately preceding the incident and the incident itself, intrinsically unbelievable, he had also failed to put many matters to the prosecution`s witnesses for their response. He had, however, put a version of the incident (that there was hugging) contradicting his defence (that there was no hugging at all on 8 October 1996) to the complainant. Further his statement in exh P4 (the s 122(6) Criminal Procedure Code statement) in response to the charge and the notice of warning was clearly an admission of guilt.
 
 
 
I agreed entirely with these findings.
 Appeal against sentence
The appellant contended that, since the district judge had noted that the wrongful restraint and the molest were not prolonged, the sentence passed was manifestly excessive. Section 354A(1) Penal Code provides for mandatory imprisonment of not less than two years and not more than ten years and for mandatory caning. The norm for offences under this section is 30 months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.
The appellant`s allegations of an affair raised evidence of a sensitive and personal nature. I agreed with the district judge`s observations in para 148 that `the accused`s attempts to save himself by casting totally unfounded aspersions on the complainant`s character were extremely wicked` and found such a line of defence extremely malicious. Accordingly I confirmed the sentence imposed in the court below.
For the reasons set out above, I dismissed both appeals.",1997-08-25 00:00:00,SG High Court
